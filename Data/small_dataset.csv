Miller on DHSs International Security Efforts Miller highlights DHSs effort to curb migration of Unaccompanied Alien Children  (Click to watch opening statement)  WASHINGTON  U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10), Vice Chair of the Committee on Homeland Security and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security, issued the following statement after conducting a hearing on the Department of Homeland Securitys (DHS) international security programs: The Constitution makes it clear the federal governments first and foremost responsibility is to provide for the common defense, a charge made increasingly difficult every day by the ever-evolving terror threats that originate overseas, which must be met with evolving security measures at home and abroad. Today, we learned about the Department of Homeland Securitys international efforts to detect terror threats. Currently, DHS has 1,800 personnel stationed in 77 foreign countries across the globe who, working closely with the Department of State, implement programs such as the Visa Security Program, as well as preclearance operations overseas  recently expanded to include airports in 15 countries. In a pre-9/11 world, preclearance was almost exclusively used to facilitate trade and tourism. However, since then, preclearance operations have shifted focus to counterterrorism and preventing the travel of foreign fighters bound for the United States. When done sensibly, preclearance operations can significantly improve our national security, helping us thwart terror plots long before they reach our borders. However, as we learned from the mistakes of the Abu Dhabi agreement, it is important we have coordination between the Executive Branch and Congress regarding the expansion of these operations, which is why I co-sponsored the Preclearance Authorization Act of 2015 (H.R. 998) that requires Congressional notification before establishing new preclearance sites. Additionally, today, we also discussed DHSs efforts to combat the flow of Unaccompanied Alien Children and families from Central America. It is, in large part, due to the efforts of DHS-led units, known as Transnational Criminal Investigative Units, along with increased enforcement by Mexican authorities, that we have seen a sharp decrease in the migration of UACs across our Southern border. I am encouraged by this decline and am hopeful we will continue to see a downward trend. The Department of Homeland Securitys presence overseas and the resources it employs internationally are critical to remaining one step ahead of those who threaten the American ideals we hold dear. However, it is also very costly. Therefore, we must ensure taxpayer resources are used in the most efficient way, maximizing our Homeland security. ###   CONNECT WITH US     Washington D.C.

[R-MO4]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email   About Me  | Contact Me  | Serving You  | Media Center  | Legislative Work  | Our District  | Resources  Dear Friend, After honoring those who have given their all for their country on Memorial Day, I had the opportunity to visit several vital assets to our national defense this week. It was a pleasure to visit with future leaders in our military when I visited the Air Force Academy and met with some of the cadets I have had the privilege of nominating for this esteemed institution. It was great to see these outstanding young people from Missouri's 4th Congressional District doing so well and leading the way as future officers in the Air Force. They are making us proud and will serve our nation well.  Vicky with Air Force Academy cadets Elisha Phillips, Stephanie Ohms, & Hunter Richardson in front of the iconic Academy Cadet Chapel. I was also able to visit Peterson Air Force Base, home of U.S. Northern Command (USNORTHCOM) and the North American Aerospace Defense Command (NORAD) to meet with commanders and see firsthand the unmatched capabilities of the forces protecting the air above North America. They keep a watch on the skies and have abilities to conduct missile defense should we ever need it. I also got to see their companion operation in Cheyenne Mountain. It is an impressive facility built inside a mountain during the Cold War to protect capabilities in the event of a nuclear blast. I hope and pray we never have to use the facility under those circumstances but it is comforting knowing they are there.   (top) Vicky outside the Cheyenne Mountain Complex entrance. (bottom) Vicky with Admiral Gortney, Commander, NORAD/USNORTHCOM In other news, this week brought some disturbing news from the Obama administration. The EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers have moved to make the overreaching Waters of the U.S. rule final. This rule could bring roadside ditches, manmade ponds, and even irrigation runoff from individual farms under federal jurisdiction. As you know, I have called for the end of this rule  many times and co-sponsored legislation  that would require the EPA to withdraw the rule. That bill has passed the House and is currently sitting in the Senate. I strongly urge my colleagues in the Senate to take up and pass this bill quickly so we can put an end to this federal land grab. Additionally, this week brought some temperamental weather to Missouris Fourth. As we continue to see heavy rains and high winds, we were reminded of the destruction that tornadoes can bring with them as one recently touched down in Lowry City  . My staff was quickly in touch with St. Clair County Presiding Commissioner Robert Salmon to gather details and be share information should anyone need the assistance of my office.  A picture of the destruction brought by the tornado in Lowry City last week. I am very thankful no one was injured and damage was limited as a result of this tornado; but want to encourage everyone to be prepared for the tornado season  have a plan  and know that my office is here to help  should it be needed. Finally, this Sunday marks the one-year anniversary of the Taliban Five-Sergeant Bergdahl prisoner swap. One year ago, President Obama transferred five senior Taliban terrorists from Guantanamo Bay to Qatar. Those terrorists will be free to return to the fight on Sunday unless a new agreement is worked out with Qatar to keep them beyond the expiration date. Congress and the American People are right to be concerned about the increased risk to our Nations safety now that these men are no longer securely held at GTMO.  (click to play video) Vicky chairs an Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee hearing in February, 2015. Since the transfer took place, my House Armed Services subcommittee, Oversight and Investigations, has been investigating the swap. We want to know why the President and his advisors felt they could ignore a law designed to provide the peoples representatives advance warning of such transfers and how they came to the decision that releasing five Taliban leaders was a good idea. Though our investigation has been hampered by the White House and the State Department, which have refused to allow DOD to turn over material critical to the investigation, I remain committed to uncovering why and how this swap came about.

All the best,                Cuba Has A Lung Cancer Vaccine, And Now It Could Be Coming To The USA  By CAROLINE REID, IFL Science!   Cuba launched the world's first lung cancer vaccine, Cimavax, to the public back in 2011. Each shot costs about $1, but the Cuban government has made the vaccine available to the public for free. Now it's 2015, and other countries are starting to get curious and want to get their hands on it too.   The Center of Molecular Immunology, Cuba, has finalized agreements with the Roswell Park Cancer Institute, USA, to embark on a project that aims to develop a lung cancer vaccine that was first made in Cuba and begin to introduce it into the United States. This will involve gaining Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approval for the vaccine and starting clinical trials.

In the last month, the National Women&rsquo;s Law Center and the Kaiser Family Foundation issued separate reports finding that insurers had often flouted a federal requirement to provide free coverage of birth control for women under the Affordable Care Act.   Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the senior Democrat on the Senate health committee, and Gretchen Borchelt, a vice president of the women&rsquo;s law center, praised the action by the administration.

It&rsquo;s not just Kirsten Gillibrand and Rosa DeLauro and Hillary Clinton advocating for paid family leave; Barack Obama discussed it in the State of the Union. Bernie Sanders is running for president and talking about equal pay for women. Bill de Blasio has mandated free pre-K in New York City. And Josh Levs, a 43-year-old CNN reporter has written a book, All In: How Our Work-First Culture Fails Dads, Families, and Businesses &ndash; and How We Can Fix It Together, arguing that it is incumbent on men to become part of a conversation about gender equality in homes and in workplaces. Levs is a former NPR reporter who has, at CNN, developed a beat reporting on issues surrounding parenthood. In 2013, he filed an EEOC claim against Time Warner when, after the early birth of his third child, he was denied the ten paid weeks offered to mothers and to adoptive or surrogate fathers.

[R-GA9]","Congressman Doug Collins Dear Lindsey,  This week started with a Memorial Day tribute at Lula, Georgia, and ended with a celebration of the best of our district at North Georgia Christian School. In between, I traveled Northeast Georgia's counties to hear from residents, before I return to Washington, D.C., to make their concerns and ideas my business in Congress.  At Lula, we honored our country's fallen heroes [link 1], who fought and died protecting our freedom. We vowed to continue their mission -- to lead lives of integrity and respect for America's founding values. The next day, I visited Gainesville's Fire and Police Departments [link 2], where Hall County public servants work to ensure our safety. In White County, they told me about ways Congress can help. [link 3]  Recently, I introduced a bill that would allow federal law enforcement officers to carry their firearms in the event of a federal funding lapse and another to improve mental health training for local police. I've voted to lower taxes and regulations. As my friends at Overdrive Logistics told me on Thursday, the Gainesville trucking company could hire more employees, if not for federal interference.  I attended a Ministers Appreciation Banquet, where we prayed for our friends and family. And at North Georgia Christian School, my week ended like it began -- on a patriotic note. Addressing the graduating class, I emphasized personal responsibility, faith and perseverance, a conservative message I'll carry with me to Congress, along with all my stories of hardworking Northeast Georgians.

Each and every one of us is indebted to these men and women and their families for the freedom we enjoy. While we can never repay them for their sacrifice, we can make the necessary reforms to take care of our veterans and their families. The House recently passed several measures to improve services to veterans. One measure, H.R. 474 [link 1], would reauthorize an important program that assists homeless veterans. During the last couple of years the number of homeless veterans has been declining thanks to programs like HUD-VASH, a joint effort between the Departments of Veterans Affairs and Housing and Urban Development. This program provides homeless veterans with housing assistance and a caseworker to help them identify other VA benefits that they may be eligible for, and has directly assisted veterans in Chico and Redding. I am proud to support this bill and will always advocate for smart and effective programs that help our veterans. Below are some recent highlights from DC and around our district.

,114,Male,N00027462,43461,"Bilirakis, Gus (Rep.) [R-FL12]","A Rebut from the Courts     facebook  twitter  you tube  5/31/2015 Memorial Day This past Monday was Memorial Day  a day to remember those brave men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for liberty.  I was honored to meet with a number of Veterans who have served our country so bravely. Too many women and men who fought for our freedoms did not return home from the theaters of war, and it was a true privilege to remember their sacrifice alongside their comrades in arms.  We must never forget the ultimate sacrifice so many have paid  not just on Memorial Day, but every day. Veterans Alternative Treatment Center Grand Opening Thomas Paine, over 200 years ago, said Those who expect to reap the blessings of freedom must, like men, undergo the fatigue of supporting it. This year, the House of Representatives have passed a number of bills with broad, bipartisan support that will help our Veterans and make positive reforms to the VA. Unfortunately, too often I have heard about Veterans being over-prescribed opioids and anti-psychotic medications. Options are limited and the number of Veterans taking their own lives every day  between 18 and 22  is a heartbreaking reminder that the One Size Fits All approach is not working. While traditional forms of therapies may work for some, tailoring personalized therapies and finding the balance between traditional and complementary alternative treatments could be the difference in saving lives. Our true American heroes deserve the options to explore what could be the next piece in a working formula to assist in their recovery  both physical and invisible wounds. That is why I reintroduced the Creating Options for Veterans Expedited Recovery Act or the COVER Act. The COVER Act will ascertain the viability of alternative complementary treatments, providing a pathway forward that will eventually allow Veterans to have a range of options for mental health treatments. This act would establish a commission to examine the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) current evidence-based therapy treatment model for treating mental health needs among veterans, and it would analyze the potential benefits of incorporating complementary alternative treatments available in non-VA medical facilities within the community. One such a facility is the Veterans Alternative Therapy Center. I was proud to speak at their grand opening on Memorial Day last Monday  I know that Centers like this will make a big difference in the lives of our Veterans. My bill will help the VA follow the path charted by these private organizations. Want to learn more? Click here.  The Courts Rebut the Administration  This week, the U.S. Court of Appeals, Fifth Circuit upheld the constitutional separation of powers by keeping in place an injunction preventing President Obamas Executive Actions on immigration from being implemented. These actions, besides representing what I believe to be an unconstitutional action, are a slight to both American citizens and legal immigrants, who have gone through the process the right way. These people should not be punished for following the law, and when illegal immigration is rewarded, that is exactly what is happening. A few weeks ago, I cosigned an amicus curiae brief with other lawmakers in support of the states lawsuit. The President said 22 times he did not have the authority to take the Executive Action he eventually did. If the President will not keep his word, I hope the Courts will force him to do so. Cures for the New Century  We have a serious problem in America  too many diseases, and not enough treatments or cures. Over the past year, I have been honored to participate in the 21st Century Cures Initiative, which examines and improves the discovery-development-delivery cycle. After over a year of engaging with patients, health care providers, researchers, clinicians, and other public and private entities, the 21st Century Cures Act was born. The 21st Century Cures Act is giving us an opportunity to address some of the structural barriers to new cures and treatments. This is about the people who need more effective treatments but do not have access to them. Two weeks ago, we took a huge step forward in bipartisan fashion and passed the 21st Century Cures Act in the Energy and Commerce Committee. The passage of the 21st Century Cures Act is one of the best things Congress has done in a very long time. The next stop for this bill? The House floor for a vote. However, it does not end there; this process will not be over until it is on the Presidents desk for his signature. I have a number of provisions in this bill to help get treatments and cures for the 30 million Americans living with a rare disease, curb prescription drug abuse, increase price transparency in Medicare, and more. Learn more about them by clicking here  .  I also had the pleasure of meeting with Max, a young boy fighting a rare disease. Meeting him was an honor  I know who I am fighting for here in DC. It is for people like Max  young and old  who live with a rare disease, that I am so proud to champion the OPEN Act, a key provision in the 21st Century Cures Act. There are over 7,000 rare diseases, impacting 30 million Americans nearly one in ten people. Over 95% of these diseases have no treatments, because each rare disease impacts a small number of patients. My bill, the OPEN Act, leverages the free market to incentivize drug makers to repurpose drugs to treat rare diseases. This bill can help millions of people by ensuring medications are safe and effective for rare conditions. Substance Abuse Legislative Panel  This week, I was part of the panel for a Pasco County Alliance for Substance Abuse Prevention conference. Substance abuse is a serious crisis that we cannot ignore. I was eager to discuss ways in which we can prevent drug abuse. This issue needs the engagement of the entire community, and I will continue to be a part of that effort.

Every few weeks, my colleagues and I go home to work throughout our Congressional districts and hear from our constituents. Besides getting to sleep in my own bed, I appreciate these weeks because I am truly able to travel throughout Ohio's 14th District to meet with constituents, community leaders, business owners and any other folks I get the chance to run across. The more I am able to hear what you are thinking, the better I am able to serve you. *Memorial Day* On Monday, it was an honor to speak in Walton Hills and Mentor to remember those who served and sacrificed for our nation. [image =  *High School Senior Projects*  Throughout the year, we have a number of high school students who complete internships and class projects by joining our office.  This week I got to meet Brent Levy, a Senior at Solon High School who has been working in our Twinsburg office this semester. He'll be starting at the University of Cincinnati in the fall. Good luck to him! [image =  Art Competition*  I recently announced the winners of the Congressional Art Competition. This week, I had a chance to meet with each of them, they are impressive young artists and students.  A special Thank You to Lakeland Community College for hosting their pieces. [image =  *May Accomplishments*  I'm looking forward to a productive June, but here's a look back at some of what we accomplished in Congress this month. - *Six bills dedicated to expanding opportunities and services for veterans* - so that the brave men and women who defend our freedom are never forgotten. - *Four bills in honor of Police Week* - so that we show appreciation to those protecting our communities and the officers killed in the line of duty. - *The Regulatory Integrity Protection Act* - so that property owners are protected from a government regulatory power grab over our nations water. - *The National Defense Authorization Act* - so that our armed forces can meet the challenges they face keeping America safe and have the funds necessary. - *The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act -* so that Congress and the American people have a say in any agreement on Irans nuclear program. - *The USA Freedom Act -*so that Americans civil liberties are protected while maintaining our intelligence agencies capabilities to defend the homeland. - *The Legislative Branch appropriations bill -*so that we can continue to limit Congress spending on itself, which has resulted in $782 million in savings to taxpayers since the Republican majority began in 2011.And Im happy to report I returned $100,000 back to the treasury last year.  - *9 bills to spur innovation -*so that we invest in and promote the entrepreneurial spirit that will lead to the next big idea. - *Extended authorities under the Highway Trust Fund -*so that we continue critical infrastructure projects during the busy construction season. - *The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act and the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act -*so that we protect the most vulnerable among us. As you can see, we have been working hard in Congress and I will continue to do serve you to the best of my ability every day.

On Monday I'll return to Washington, where the House is scheduled to be in session for eight of the next nine weeks before August. While there is a lot of work to be done on Capitol Hill (more on that below), weeks like this are also important because they give me the opportunity to see what's going on at home and hear directly from folks like you. One of the top concerns I heard last week was that a lack of American leadership on the world's stage has fueled conflicts in the Middle East and emboldened Russian and Chinese aggression toward their neighbors. The reality is that if America doesn't lead, the free world lacks direction and the dictators of the world lack restraint. We have challenges at home, but the United States is still the foremost country that protects individual freedom and liberties and believes in representative government and the rule of law. We should never apologize for that or retreat from our responsibility to defend our values. I talked with Don Marsh on St. Louis Public Radio last week about conflicts around the world and why I think American leadership promotes peace and security. You can listen to that interview HERE  . Another topic that often came up in my travels last week is the Obama Administration's controversial Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule. The White House says the only people who have a reason to oppose this disastrous rule are 'polluters who knowingly threaten our clean water.' Well they should tell that to the hardworking farmers and struggling small business owners in my district who see right through this EPA power grab; they should tell it to the state and local governments who spoke out against this federal overreach; and they should tell it to their own Small Business Administration who urged EPA and the Corps to withdraw the rule last year. The fight over WOTUS is far from over. I've cosponsored and voted in support of two bipartisan bills to stop this economically devastating rule, and I will continue to oppose this erosion of Americans' property rights until the Administration ditches their bad WOTUS rule for good. There's other work to be done on Capitol Hill as well. Over the next eight weeks of legislative activity, the House is expected to vote on landmark legislation  to speed up the discovery, development and delivery of 21st Century cures and treatments. We'll also likely consider bipartisan legislation  I've been working on to modernize the way EPA evaluates chemical safety. I encourage you to find me on Facebook and follow me on Twitter to stay up to date on what I'm working and voting on in Washington. You can also see when I or my staff are coming to host Open Office Hours and Traveling Help Desks near you on my website  .

Our service academies are among our greatest colleges, offering fine instructors and a rigorous course load. This week, I was proud to announce the five 10th District appointees [to the service academies for 2015. On Thursday four of the five appointees joined me at my Hickory office for a reception in their honor. On the left below is Krysta Przestrzelski of Swannanoa and, on the right, Tyler Mispley of Stanley both of whom will be attending the U.S. Naval Academy. On the left below is Zoe Barnette of Kings Mountain who will attend the Air Force Academy. On the right is Nathaniel Meade of Hickory who will be attending the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. Our fifth appointee, Anabella Motley of Asheville, was unable to attend Thursday's reception. She will be joining Krysta and Tyler at the U.S. Naval Academy. Congratulations to all five appointees on this tremendous accomplishment. I have no doubt they will be great representatives for the 10th District at the academies and, after graduation, as they serve as officers in the armed forces. You can read more about Thursday's reception in the Lincoln Times-News [For additional photos from Thursday's ceremony, please visit my Facebook [and Instagram [pages. Recognizing the 10th District's Art Contest Winner On Thursday I also welcomed Evette Terhon-Hernandez to my Hickory office to congratulate her on winning the 10th District's annual Congressional Art Contest. Evette was previously announced as the winner [for her artwork ""Little Patriot,"" which can be seen below. Evette, a student at Maiden High School, was joined at Thursday's celebration by her parents Pedro and Bibiana, her art teacher Elizabeth Taylor, and Maiden High principal Rob Bliss. I look forward to seeing Evette's work as I walk through the U.S. Capitol where it will be prominently displayed for the year ahead. For additional photos from Thursday's event, please visit my Facebook [and Instagram [pages. Visits Across NC-10 Following a holiday weekend with family and friends remembering our fallen heroes, I spent the week making visits across the 10th District. On Wednesday I visited the Mount Holly Historical Society. The society was founded in 2010 to preserve the history of Mount Holly and northeastern Gaston County. The museum features a number of fascinating exhibits highlighting the area's history. I spent Thursday and Friday in Buncombe County. My first stop on Thursday was to the Buncombe County Emergency Communications Center in Asheville. While there I met with staff and learned about the vital role they play in protecting Buncombe County residents. The communications center is responsible for dispatching all fire, EMS, and law enforcement calls in the county. Special thanks to Buncombe County Emergency Services Director Jerry VeHaun for hosting me and leading my tour of the facility. While in Asheville, I also had the opportunity to speak with the local media. Thursday I joined Pete Kaliner on his daily show to discuss all that has been going on in Congress in recent weeks. Friday morning, I joined WLOS' Evan Donovan to talk about my work in Washington serving NC-10. Video of the interview can be found here [For additional photos from my visits across the 10th District, be sure to like my Facebook page [and follow me on Instagram [and Twitter [What I Have Been Reading She spelled for a nation [Gaston Gazette Great to see another 10th District representative in the annual Scripps National Spelling Bee. This year, Gastonia's Kayleigh Guffey represented our area in the bee. Kayleigh had won the Gaston Gazette's annual competition advancing to the finals, held in the Washington suburbs. While Kayleigh did not win, making it this far is a significant accomplishment. Congratulations Kayleigh! Appeals court rules against Obama on immigration program [The Washington Post Very important ruling from the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals this week as they denied the Obama Administration's request to lift the block on President Obama's immigration executive actions. I signed on to a brief supporting the states' challenge to the President's illegal orders and I am glad to see the 5th Circuit make the correct decision. President Obama's actions went well beyond his powers something he himself has acknowledged over 20 times and I will continue to fight them in any way I can going forward. Class of 2015 faces grim job hunt [Politico As college students in the 10th District and across the state graduate, they are coming up against the distressing reality of our nation's job market. While unemployment rates continue to fall, countless college graduates are not seeing any gain as they continue to see unemployment rates higher than the national average.

Then,on Thursday,the Administration urged a federal district court to dismiss the House's case against President Obama over his unconstitutional changes to Obamacare.U.S. District Judge Rosemary Collyer questioned the Administration's argument against standing. While she did not issue her ruling, the House's legal team made a sound argument for standing and I remain optimistic about the outcome.  This lawsuit is based off the STOP Resolution I introduced in 2013. After my resolution gained support from a majority of the Republican majority, House leadership decided to file a case and listed one of the claims in the STOP Resolution. Prior to the court hearing, I discussed the importance of the House's lawsuit and the impact it could have on the balance of power within the federal government with *The Hill*.

[R-AL1]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email  News from Representative Bradley Byrne  ABOUT BRADLEY  | HOW CAN I HELP  | CONTACT BRADLEY  | WANT TO RECEIVE MY UPDATES?  Friends, >From my first day in Congress, I have been committed to being as open and accessible as possible. I've held over 35 town hall meetings  throughout the First District, including town halls over the phone and on Facebook. I wanted you to be among the first to know about two upcoming town halls I have planned in Baldwin County. The details are below. Orange Beach Town Hall Meeting Friday, June 5 at 10:00 a.m. Orange Beach City Hall (4099 Orange Beach Blvd, Orange Beach) Eastern Shore Town Hall Meeting Monday, June 8 at 6:00 p.m. Trojan Hall at Daphne High School (9300 Lawson Road, Daphne) I hope that you can join me at one of these meetings. My staff and I are also finalizing the details for a big town hall tour in the month of August, so stayed tuned for more information on those events in the coming weeks. A Victory Against Executive Amnesty On Tuesday of last week, a federal appeals court refused a request  from the Obama administration to allow him to move forward with his executive action granting amnesty to over five million illegal immigrants. This was a major victory against President Obama's efforts to use executive action to change our nation's immigration laws. I've said repeatedly that President Obama's plan is unconstitutional. We need to fix our nation's immigration laws, but those changes shouldn't come in the form of executive action from a lame duck President. Congress is the part of government responsible for making the laws. I know it may not be politically convenient, but it is the way our government works. Rest assured, I will continue to stand up for the rule of law during my time in Congress. Waters of the US Rule Last week, the Obama administration and the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) officially issued a new rule known as the ""Waters of the US"" rule  . This rule would allow the federal government to regulate bodies of water across the country, including those as small as a drainage ditch.  For decades, water quality regulation has been primarily the responsibility of state governments, but President Obama has issued a rule that would significantly shift that responsibility to the federal government. This rule will have an especially harmful impact on our farmers and foresters, who will face new compliance requirements and costs. The House has passed a bill that would do away with this flawed rule, and I hope the Senate will soon act on our bill. This power grab by the federal government must be stopped. Week in Review  Small Business Visit: Last week I paid a visit to Bay Wood Products in Robertsdale  to learn more about their operation and visit with their employees. Bay Wood produces wooden pallets, dunnage, and custom crates. They employ over 100 people and produce around 85,000 pallets a month. Thanks to Bay Wood Founder and President Jimmy Wilson for hosting me! I-10 Bridge Update: You may have heard that the U.S. Secretary of Transportation's visit to Mobile was cancelled due to severe weather, but we are already working to get that visit rescheduled. Despite that bad news, a number of important meetings and discussions were held among city and county officials. I even outlined one source of funding that I believe can be used to finance the bridge. Learn more about that by clicking here  .  Visiting Cuba: I just returned from a trip to Cuba to learn more about our efforts to restore diplomatic and economic relations. The photo above is me with our delegation visiting the Port of Mariel in Cuba. While I want the U.S. to be able to restore relations, I believe the Cuban regime must be willing to change from their current ways. Stay tuned for a full update on my trip in the next few days. First Airbus Parts to Arrive: On Friday, the first airplane parts left Germany via ship headed toward Mobile. These parts will likely arrive in early June. Once the parts arrive, I expect a special celebration to occur in Mobile. This celebration will be similar to the celebrations held in Europe when the large airplane parts arrive. Click here  to learn more about this exciting news. What's Ahead Next week, the House will be back in session to take care of a number of important legislative tasks on the agenda. Most important to our area, the House is expected to pass the Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act  . This is the bill which includes my important reforms designed to get us a longer Red Snapper season. Additionally, the House is expected to vote on: * H.R. 1168  : The Native American Children's Safety Act; * H.R. 944  : To reauthorize the National Estuary Program; * S. 802  : Girls Count Act of 2015; and * H.R. 2578  : Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act.

We were joined by speakers from the Red Cross, New Hanover County Sheriff's office and Emergency Management, and WWAY-TV meteorologist Scott Dean. Attendees were able to ask speakers questions and learn best practices.  We Have a Winner! On Thursday our office named Lydia Johnson winner of the 2015 Congressional Art Competition. Lydias water color and ink portrait, Mal de Mer, will hang in the United States Capitol where Congressional members, staff, and visitors will be able to enjoy her work. Additionally, she has been invited to a reception in the U.S. Capitol on June 24, 2015 to honor her achievement. The Congressional Art Competition is an opportunity to recognize our talented young students. Our office received more than 20 submissions from artists across the district. I was very impressed by Lydias work and look forward to recognizing her in Washington in June!   The Obama Administration is at it again... Earlier this week, the Obama Administration announced their plans to move forward with a rule from the EPA that would redefine the ""Waters of the U.S."" and increase their authority over minor bodies of water like wetlands, streams, and ponds. I am very disappointed in the Administrations decision to ignore the will of the American people and move forward with this sweeping regulation. This new definition would extend the EPAs regulatory reach to seemingly any body of water including the water puddled in your ditch after a rain storm. Earlier this month, the House passed a bill that called for the EPA to scrap this rule and start anew by engaging stakeholders at the local level. This is another example of government overreach that must be stopped, and I will continue to fight against it every step of the way. Legislative Update * The House passed, with my support, the America COMPETES Act (H.R. 1806). This bill authorizes funding for specified research and education programs like the National Science Foundation and the Department of Energy. We also passed the American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015 which makes permanent the Research & Development tax credit, giving our business owners much needed certainty. * The House passed, and I voted for, the SPACE Act of 2015 (H.R. 2262) which encourages private sector investment in the commercial space industry creating stable and predictable regulatory conditions and improving safety. * Americans for Tax Reform announced support for my No New Hires for the Delinquent IRS Act (H.R. 1206). This bill will help hold Washington bureaucrats accountable. ATR President, Grover Norquist, had this to say: One would think that willfully violating tax law would be a disqualifier for government work, especially at the IRS. Guess not.""

[R-FL6]"," A Message From the Office of Congressman DeSantis Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email   Contact Me  Constituent Services  Media Center  Legislation  Help With a Federal Agency  Dear Friend- Washington must be committed to caring for those who have served our nation. The high-profile failures of the VA have been deeply concerning and Congress must do more to improve veteran care. Since I came to Washington, I have been a staunch advocate for our military men and women and I promise that I will continue to fight to ensure that the government honors our commitment to our veterans. I hope that the new VA Medical Center in Orlando, which was dedicated on Tuesday, will provide first-rate care for our Central Florida veterans. This facility will provide primary and specialty care to more than 100,000 veterans in the region.  Rep. DeSantis speaking at the dedication of the Orlando VA Medical Center. I also had an opportunity this week to speak at a Military Officers Association of America lunch in Daytona Beach. We discussed a number of issues critical to maintaining a strong military force, ensuring that our troops have the resources they need, and protecting our national security. This was a particularly timely discussion since one year ago, President Obama released five seasoned Taliban terrorists in exchange for Bowe Bergdahl, a solider who was captured by the Taliban after abandoning his post. As part of the deal, the terrorists have been under a travel ban being enforced by Qatar, which is now expiring. A recent report has revealed that nearly 30% of released detainees return to jihad. This is the dangerous, but foreseeable, outcome of the administration's policy of releasing these dangerous terrorists from Guantanamo Bay. Congress must take action to protect the homeland and prevent recidivism by holding detainee-receiving nations accountable. Senator Tom Cotton and I have introduced the Guantanamo Bay Recidivism Prevention Act, which would eliminate foreign aid if a country holding a released detainee allows them to return to terror.  Rep. DeSantis hears from local leaders at the Daytona Regional Chamber of Commerce. Finally, thank you to the Daytona Regional Chamber of Commerce for hosting me on Thursday at your community leadership meeting! I was glad to provide a legislative update and answer questions from some of the local leaders in Volusia County.

,114,Male,N00033630,43629,"Hudson, Richard (Rep.) [R-NC8]","Congressman Richard Hudson *Friends,*  *Partisanship and gridlock - arent you tired of it? Me too. *Thats why its a priority of mine to break through the gridlock, build relationships across the aisle, and find bipartisan solutions to the problems we face. Ive always said that you could put me in a room with nearly any Democrat and give us a problem, and Id work with her or him to find common ground and solve it without compromising my conservative principles. *Last year, I championed two bills that unanimously passed Congress and were signed into law by the president because I worked hard and brought everyone to the table. Its a rarity, but bipartisanship is possible.*  In that regard, my colleagues on the U.S. House Energy and Commerce Committee and I are continuing to make good progress. Under Chairman Fred Uptons leadership, we have made tremendous bipartisan strides to improve public health. *And this time we are taking it one step further to accelerate new cures and ensure America remains the global leader in medical innovation.*  For more than a year, the committee has worked on the 21st Century Cures initiative to take a comprehensive look at what steps we can take to accelerate the pace of cures in America. *Were working with patients, innovators, care givers, regulators, researchers, doctors - you name it - to build a 21st century health care system that encourages greater innovation, supports advanced research, and streamlines drug development. *Our end goal is to deliver life-saving cures and treatments to patients more quickly and more efficiently.  As health care innovation moves at lightning speed, groundbreaking discoveries are changing the face of disease treatment, management and cures. Here in North Carolina, were blessed to have some of the best health care facilities, universities and corporations that conduct cutting-edge research to identify, treat and prevent diseases. The problem is the burdensome regulatory policies and approval infrastructure are stuck in the past. Our laws have not kept up with innovation. Washington is holding back new discoveries and advancements in technology with red-tape and bureaucracy. *If we want to save more lives, foster American innovation and keep jobs here, Congress must ensure that our nations laws and regulations not only keep pace, but enable even more life-saving innovation.*  *Im proud to announce that a few weeks ago the Committee advanced the 21st Century Cures Act by a vote of 51-0. *While there is more work to be done, this is a monumental accomplishment in the path to accelerate discovery, development and delivery of vital treatments and cures.  In spite of Washingtons gridlock, there are corners of Congress where meaningful work gets done on behalf of the American people. *My colleagues and I on the Energy and Commerce Committee will continue to work together on areas where we can find common ground and put you, your family and your priorities first. The 21st Century Cures Act demonstrates that it can be done, and Im proud of the progress we are making on such a critical, life-saving issue.*   *Until next week,* * [image = *Richard Hudson* *Member of Congress (NC-08)* ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- Washington D.C.

,114,Female,N00029077,43480,"Jenkins, Lynn (Rep.) [R-KS2]","Congresswoman Lynn Jenkins *Colmery-ONeil VA Hospital*: Last week, I received a letter from the VA Heartland Director, which stated that we anticipate the temporary pause on the Emergency Department to be removed by the end of May. It has now been nearly two years since I first heard of problems at the Colmery-O'Neil VA Hospital [link 1], and more than 15 months since the Emergency Room closed due to staffing problems. In that time, I have been workinghard on resolving the situation. After receiving the letter, Senator Jerry Moran and I visited with leaders at Colmery-ONeil on Tuesday to receive afirsthand update on thecurrent situation. Local officials informed us that the hospital emergency room is in fact waiting to reopen, pending final approval from the VA in Washington. Kansas veterans deserve the best and most timely care possible, so it is my hope the emergency room will finally reopen within the next few days. To watch WIBWs coverage of the situation, click here [link 2]. [image = Colmery-O'Neil.jpg] *Honoring Senator Bob Dole:* It was an honor to attend the Senator Bob Dole Room Dedication Ceremony at the Combat Air Museum on Thursday. There is noone more deserving of this honor than Senator Dole. He has always been one of Kansas best, and it is a privilege to have the chance to call him my mentor and my friend. Renaming the education center at the Air Museum after Senator Dole is a fitting and lasting tribute to an outstanding lifetime that has truly made a difference in our country. [image = Dedication 4.jpg] I also had a great time touring the Mars plant in Topeka with Senator Dole and Senator Pat Roberts earlier this week. As many of you know, M&Ms have always been my personal favorite, and knowing that they are bringing jobs to Kansas makes it even sweeter! [image = Chocolate 1.jpg] *Breaking Ground For NBAF:* I am proud to have attended the groundbreaking ceremony for NBAF this past Wednesday - a state of the art facility to protect our food source right here at home. As a country girl myself, feeding the world is something I am committed to, and this facility will help ensure our safety. Thank you to all the incredible people who worked to so hard to bring this facility to Kansas and to make the groundbreaking a reality. [image = *Celebrating National 529 Day:* This Friday marked National 529 College Savings Day, a day specifically designated to increase awareness of 529 plans. These 529 funds are an issue near and dear to my heart [link 3]. In January, the President threatened to tax 529 plans, seeking to pay for another one of his pet projects. Instead the House of Representatives rallied around my bill, H.R. 529, and quickly and overwhelmingly passed the legislation with over 400 votes [link 4]. We need college savings vehicles like 529 plans. Students from all over the country struggle with spiraling tuition costs and we must do everything we can to encourage families to plan ahead and save for their childrens future. I am proud to have celebrated 529 Day as a champion of this important college savings tool, and I encourage the Senate to quickly pass this legislation so that we can start giving more help to hardworking families. [image = 529 Day Webcast.jpg] *The EPAs Latest Power Grab:* This week, President Obamas administration announced they are moving forward with the final rule to expand the designation of waters that will be subject to regulations under the Clean Water Act, known as Waters of the United States [link 5]. This comes after, just weeks ago, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1732 [link 6], a bipartisan bill that specifically sought to block the Administration's rule change. Instead of listening to the American people, the administration not only ignored them, but did the exact opposite by againpursuing their priorities instead of the priorities of ordinary Americans. The rule change announced this week would unnecessarily add thousands of private bodies of water to the definition of what the government can regulate. Rest assured, this is not the end, and I will continue to fight for the rights of individuals, farmers, ranchers, home owners and family businesses, and against the Presidents overreach and massive expansion of the federal governments authority. *Halting President Obamas Immigration Actions:* I was pleased to see the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals uphold an injunction this week prohibiting implementation of President Obamas executive overreach on immigration. This is the second major ruling to have gone against this administration, and the Appeals Court in Texas stated that it was in the publics interest to maintain the injunction. The President cannot unilaterally change immigration policy and this ruling is another sign that the court of law agrees with that statement. Click here [link 7] to read more coverage about the ruling, and whats this means for the Presidents immigration actions. *Coffees With Your Congresswoman Around Eastern Kansas:* I had a great time traveling around Eastern Kansas throughout the week as part of my Coffee with your Congresswoman tour and chatting with folks about their issues and their priorities. We talked about everything from tax reform and the budget process to the Lesser Prairie Chicken.

[D-CO7]","Your Passwords Belong to You, Not Your Employer In recent years there have been news stories highlighting a disturbing increase in the number of employers asking prospective employees to hand over usernames and passwords to their personal accounts on sites like Facebook and Twitter. Some job applicants are even being asked during interviews to log into these websites allowing interviewers to browse applicants profile, acquaintances, and other information. Have a great idea but cant afford a patent? Filing a patent can be an expensive process and might seem out of reach for many Coloradans. In the 112th Congress, I supported the America Invents Act which took a big step in reforming the patent process and ensuring everyone has access to protecting intellectual property. Colorado is now home to a U.S. Patent and Trade Office and the ProBoPat program which connects lower income Colorado inventors with patent preparers for reduced or no fee. Click here to learn more about how to apply. Other potential employees are being asked as a condition of new or continued employment to provide passwords on job applications or to friend the employer so the employer can view applicants private information. Thats why I re-introduced H.R. 2277, the Password Protection Act of 2015 to prevent employers from requiring current and prospective employees to hand over their personal passwords as a condition of either keeping or getting a new job. The bipartisan legislation would end this abuse by prohibiting employers from forcing employees into releasing their private online user information stored on the internet. Forcing employees to turn over their personal information to employers opens the door for employers to act as imposters and assume the identity of an employee and continually access, monitor and even manipulate an employee's personal social activities and opinions.

Helping Colorados Small Businesses Ed meets with small business leaders from the Arvada Chamber of Commerce This month, the Arvada Chamber of Commerce and I held a roundtable discussion (pictured left) with local businesses to hear about the challenges and opportunities of doing business in the 7th Congressional District. We heard from small, medium and large-sized businesses and discussed issues ranging from the Affordable Care Act to the challenges around hiring skilled workers. Its incredibly helpful to hear firsthand from businesses in the district about what theyre experiencing in their day-to-day operations. Small businesses are the lifeline of our economy both in Colorado and across the country and we must make sure we are doing everything we can to support them. Today, more than half of Americans either own or work for a small business making these companies the foundation of Americas economy. If you run a small business in Colorado, I want to hear from you!

,114,Male,N00030771,43520,"Gosar, Paul (Rep.) [R-AZ4]"," Contact Me | Media Center | Our District Dear Friend, This past week, we picked up a major win in the fight to stop Obama's illegal amnesty. On Tuesday, the Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals upheld the February ruling by U.S. District Judge Andrew Hanen who issued an injunction to stop President Obamas unconstitutional November 2014 executive immigration orders from going into effect. This decision is a huge win for the rule of law and our Constitution. Article I gives Congress clear jurisdiction on immigration matters and the Obama Administrations rogue executive actions have clearly infringed on that authority. The list of federal judges who have ruled Obama violated the law is growing, and the opinion of the Fifth Circuit confirms the presidents overreach. Needless to say, I am thrilled by the court's decision and will continue to do my part to rein in this unaccountable, out-of-control federal government that has chosen not to enforce our immigration laws. Honoring the Life of Arizona's Favorite Son, Barry Goldwater It was great to have the Goldwater family attend Friday's dedication ceremony for the Barry Goldwater Post Office in Prescott, Arizona. This is where ""Mr. Conservative"" launched his presidential campaign almost 50 years ago and it is only fitting that we dedicate this post office in his honor. Its important to note that the effort to have this post office named to honor Barry Goldwater was first initiated by the people of Prescott. Eventually, a petition was started to rename the post office and I was more than happy to introduce the necessary legislation to make the change possible which had the support of the entire Arizona delegation. Barry Goldwaters influence on American history as well as the love of those who admired him cannot be understated. His commitment was first and foremost to the Constitution and to the people of Arizona whom he served. Bill O'Reilly Reports on My Coach Only Airfare for Capitol Hill (COACH) Act Luxury airfare accommodations for Congress utilizing taxpayer monies would be inappropriate in any fiscal climate, but at a time with a federal debt in excess of $18 trillion, such expenditures are especially wasteful. Furthermore, if current regulations prevent men and women serving in the U.S. military from flying first-class, there is absolutely no reason Congress should be given a special exemption not offered to our nations heroes. Legislation I introduced, called the COACH Act (H.R. 2210), has 19 bipartisan cosponsors and will end this double standard.

Opponents of the Ex-Im say the bank is a form of ""cronyism"" and ""corporate welfare"" for big businesses. But proponents argue that the bank helps sustain domestic jobs and allows for U.S. businesses to make inroads in emerging markets where the private sector won't finance deals. By financing the export of American goods and services, Ex-Im Bank has supported 1.3 million private-sector, American jobs since 2009, supporting 164,000 jobs in FY 2014 alone. Between 2007 and 2014 in Missouris Fourth District alone, the Ex-Im supported $394 million in exports by authorizing $85 million in financing  . My colleague, Congressman Stephen Fincher from Tennessee, has introduced a bill to reauthorize the Ex-Im bank for five years. But the Ex-Im Bank is not a perfect institution. This bill also includes reforms to the bank that will make it more transparent and accountable, such as requiring an annual independent audit of the bank's financing portfolio, limiting the terms of the banks president, and capping the total amount of outstanding loans the bank can carry at any given time. Question of the week: How should Congress proceed with regards to the Export-Import Bank? Congress should reauthorize the bank. Congress should not reauthorize the bank. Congress should reauthorize, but also reform the bank. I am unsure. Click to open in a separate window  This email was sent from an unmonitored email address. Please do not reply to this email.

[R-OH2]","Stop Human Trafficking Earlier this month, the House and Senate presented the President with the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 (S. 178), bipartisan legislation which takes steps to address the serious human rights concerns of human trafficking. This legislation imposes a $5,000 fine on convicted sex offenders, human smugglers, and human traffickers; uses fines collected from offenders to finance programs designed for victims of human trafficking; improves current training programs on human trafficking for law enforcement agencies; and strengthens law enforcement's ability to identify and prosecute human trafficking offenses. I was proud to support this legislation to put an end to modern-day slavery. Helping Our Homeless Veterans House passes my legislation to better serve our homeless veterans Recently, the House of Representatives passed my legislation, the Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Programs Reauthorization Act (H.R. 474), to better assist America's homeless veterans. This legislation ensures that veterans who are homeless, as well as those transitioning out of incarceration, are eligible for various services provided by the Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Program, including job training services, housing assistance, and substance abuse counseling. 2nd District Spotlight: Control Bionics A local business right here in Ohio's Second District is developing life-changing, innovative technology to assist severely-disabled individuals, including some of our nation's veterans. Last Thursday, I visited Control Bionics to learn more about the NeuroSwitch, a device that harnesses the brain's electrical signals to enable individuals to communicate through computers. An Overreaching EPA Last week, the EPA released a new Waters of the United States rule, which would give the agency the power to regulate millions of acres of land across the United States. This new rule gives the EPA unprecedented power to police even the smallest areas with connections to navigable waters, like ditches and puddles. This is yet another example of the EPA and this administration's out-of-control bureaucracy. Earlier this month, I supported H.R. 1732, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act of 2015, which would have rejected this EPA ruling before it could take effect. H.R. 1732 passed the House, but the Senate failed to consider it. As your representative, I will continue this fight in Congress to rein in the EPA. A Tribute to America's Fallen Heroes Last week we celebrated Memorial Day, a day dedicated to the memory of those who gave the last full measure of devotion to defend the way of life we hold so dear.

Steve Pearce issued the following statement after the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) published its finalized Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule. The so-called Waters of the U.S. rule is the latest power grab by the federal government to take away more local decision-making over water management, stated Pearce. The final WOTUS rule released today spans 297 pages. By definition, like the proposed version, this new rule threatens the livelihoods of farmers, ranchers, small business owners, counties and local governments, who are already overregulated by the federal government. On May 12, a bipartisan majority in the House passed the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act (H.R. 1732) that would block the WOTUS rule. While I will review the effect of this new, burdensome stack of federal regulations, I will continue to push back against any and all threats to private property rights and urge the Senate to take action to do the same.  *APPEALS COURTS KEEP BLOCK OF OBAMA IMMIGRATION PLAN* The Fifth Circuit Court ruled that the preliminary injunction against the Presidents executive order to legalize millions of illegal immigrants will stand. This blocks the Presidents order from taking effect. While the Court must still issue a ruling on the constitutionality of the order, this is a major victory for the 26 states who sued, and for the rule of law. Under the Constitution, Congress, not the president, makes law on immigration and naturalization. The president has admitted more than 20 times that he cannot do what he has done with his order. Congressman Pearce said, No one is above the law -- not even the president. Neither I nor the American people favor amnesty. You can read the full article by clicking here.

It was a fun filled day and both the Isleta Head Start and the Isleta Elementary School gave terrific dance performances!  *CONGRESSMAN STEVE PEARCE TELLS BELARUS LEADERS  BELIEF IN GOD WAS CENTRAL TO U.S. FOUNDING FATHERS* It was unprecedented - Congressman Steve Pearce became the first U.S. Congressman to address the Belarusian Parliament and he talked about a subject that would have been forbidden in this former Communist country only a few short years ago - the Holy Bible and its role in the founding of the United States. In a speech before Belarusian national leaders on Thursday, U.S. Congressman Pearce, 2nd D, New Mexico, talked about how biblical concepts of truth, honesty, fairness, trust and hope - the underpinnings of the U.S. Constitution - can benefit the country that was once a part of the Soviet Union. A high-ranking Parliament member of the Presidential Republic was receptive to Congressman Pearce and the two had a formal one hour meeting before his speech. Congressman Pearce's address was among a number of events planned for this week's trip that was arranged at the invitation of Belarusian President Alexander Lukashenko who is examining ways to broaden the use of the Bible in the nation's culture. Ralph Drollinger, President and Founder of Capitol Ministries is leading a team in Belarus through a partnership with Russian-born Mikhail Morgulis, writer, theologian and President of the ministry, Spiritual Diplomacy. Morgulis was asked by President Lukashenko to spearhead the Bible-infusion exploration. Among other efforts, the Capitol Ministries team is working to establish a discipleship Bible-teaching Bible study for national leaders. Congressman Pearce is a leading Congressional Sponsor of Capitol Ministries in Washington DC. After the Congressman's speech, four leading Belarusian pastors said they plan to hand deliver printed copies of the speech to individual Parliament members and invite them to attend an off campus Bible study they will be teaching. Danielle Drollinger represented the Washington DC's Museum of The Bible in a meeting with the Belarusian minister of Public Education. She presented The Museum of the Bible's Public School Curriculum, ""The Bible As Literature,"" a three year textbook series that integrates more than 400 iPad apps. The education officials were very receptive and said they will present the material to their decision making body. On Saturday night, former Christian NBA players will compete with the Belarusian National Team on nationwide TV, and during the half-time show, will talk about their personal Christian testimonies and present the Gospel message to the nation. A news team from The Christian Broadcasting Network traveled with the Capitol Ministries contingent and will be creating a television program on the trip and the outreach efforts. When it is completed, a link to the program will be found on the Capitol Ministries Website. Ralph Drollinger has asked that partners and supporters continue to pray for the trip and for the success of the ministry partnerships in Belarus.  *HELP OUR OFFICE WELCOME BACK JOE MARTINEZ!* Its great to have Joe Martinez, our Las Cruces Field Representative, back in the office.

Here are some photos to help tell the story of what has happened in the last few weeks across the Second Congressional District of Oklahoma:  A flooded bridge on Highway 377 between Madill and Tishomingo observed by my Field Representative Eddy Dempsey.  I was briefed on the historic water levels at Hugo Lake in Choctaw County.  I observed a washed-out section of River Bend Road at Beavers Bend State Park in McCurtain County on Wednesday afternoon.  My Field Representative, Betty Ford, saw significant damage at a housing addition in LeFlore County.  Damage on Pleasant Valley Road in Poteau observed by my Field Representative, Betty Ford.  My Field Representative, Debbie Dooley, documented the flooding at Riverview Park in Miami.  I joined Broken Bow City Manager, Vickie Pieratt, and McCurtain County District 2 Commissioner, Joe Coffman, to discuss flood conditions below the spillway on Broken Bow Lake, where a parking lot and road was washed away and damage occurred to the City of Broken Bow's water pump station.  My Field Representative, Betty Ford, observed the marina restaurant under water at Lake Eufaula in McIntosh County.  And finally, we've seen many Oklahomans make the best out of a bad situation. In McCurtain County, Chris Strawn found a new fishing hole at Little River Park! Please continue to stay safe this week.

They have made incredible progress and plan to begin paving the runway as soon as September. While I was visiting, emergency personnel were conducting their tri-annual disaster preparedness training exercise, required under law by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA). Firefighters from five different fire departments, Emergency Medical Services (EMS), and hospital workers came together at the airport to make sure their response to a major disaster would be seamless. Thank you to the emergency personnel who participated. I'm grateful for their commitment to keeping members of the community and those traveling throughout the area safe.

To learn more about my background and goals for the Committee, please watch the video below:  Standing Up To the EPA's Latest Power Grab Last week, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced the sweeping final Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule, which allows the EPA to define which streams, rivers, ponds, wetlands, ditches, and waterways are subject to the regulations of the Clean Water Act. The rule massively broadens the scope of the agency's power. The EPA's announcement came just weeks after a bipartisan coalition in the House passed the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act (H.R. 1732), which required the EPA to withdraw the rule. Numerous governors and state attorney generals also spoke out against the rule as well as agriculture organizations and trade associations. The EPA has a long history of dramatically overstepping its legal authority, but this latest attempt is unprecedented even for the power-hungry federal agency. The new EPA rule is nothing short of a tyrannical federal power grab that would unnecessarily burden farmers, businesses, private property owners, and state and local governments. Under the rule, virtually every river, stream, and creek in the U.S. would be subject to the regulations of the Clean Water Act and come under the oversight of federal bureaucrats. Every American wants clean drinking water and to protect our nations waterways. However, the means by which we accomplish things cannot be through the unilateral issuance of sweeping, overly burdensome regulations that serve to harm the very people that our laws are originally intended to protect. I am committed to doing all in my power to oppose this power grab and stand up for farmers, ranchers, and small business owners.

Paul Ryan May 28, 2015 The House of Representatives is preparing to vote on a bill to establish whats called trade promotion authority or TPA. The bill may not sound like a showstopper, but the vote has Americas alliesand rivalson the edge of their seats. If the House rejects TPA, it will signal to the world that America itself, not just President Obama, has grown weary of leadership. By contrast, if the House approves TPA, it will show that America is once again taking the lead. Six years of a feckless foreign policy have eroded Americas credibility. Other countries dont trust (or fear) the U.S. because they think the president is all talk and no action. Congress needs to show the world that even though the president doesnt always follow through, it can still rely on America. And given the state of affairs, establishing TPA would be a real sign of seriousness. Right now, the U.S. is negotiating two historic trade dealsone with countries on the Pacific Rim and the other with the European Union. One of the talks is already far along, but the countries involved have yet to put their best offers on the table for a simple reason: Under the Constitution, the president can negotiate a trade deal, but Congress must approve it. And this division of power makes other countries think twice. They dont want to make concessions to the administration only to see Congress rewrite the deal. So ever since the days of FDR, Congress has worked to establish TPA or something like it to beef up Americas leverage at the negotiating table. What exactly is TPA? Its a process for negotiating trade dealsone that puts Congress in the drivers seat. Under TPA, when the president submits a deal, Congress agrees to give it an up-or-down vote, without amending itbut only on three conditions. First, the deal must address nearly 150 negotiating objectives set by Congress, like tearing down trade barriers to American products or putting up protections for U.S. intellectual property. Second, the administration must consult regularly with Congress during the negotiations and give every elected representative direct access to U.S. negotiators and the negotiating text. Third, the administration must make the text of the deal public for 60 days before the president can sign it so the American people can read it first. And in the end, Congress gets the final say. Whatever the proposed changes to U.S. law are, Congress must approve them. Only TPA will reassure other countries they can trust the U.S., and so only TPA can give the U.S. the leverage it needs to win a fair deal for Americas workers. And sealing the deal will renew American leadership in the world. One of the easiest ways to extend American influence is to expand American trade. Opening up other countries markets to the U.S. binds them togetherbecause when the U.S. grows, they grow. As a result, its in their interest to work with the U.S. for a greater, shared prosperity. For many countries, these trade deals demonstrate the value of American leadership: When the world plays by Americas rules, everybody benefits. But other countries are trying to rewrite the rules without us. China is negotiating trade deals all over the worlddeals that will let its products in and keep Americas out. So if the U.S. keeps standing still, it will fall behind. Between 2000 and 2010, for instance, the countries of East Asia completed 48 trade deals among themselves. And the U.S.? It negotiated just two of them. As a result, Americas share of East Asias imports fell by 42 percent. Less market share means less influence. So we as a country have to ask ourselves: Is China going to write the rules of the global economy, or is America? Our allies in Asia are watching. Many of them are trying to decide for themselves whats the best way forward: American-style free enterprise or Chinese-style crony-capitalism. These countries want to stand with the U.S., but before they place their bets, they need to know that America is strong and reliable. Establishing TPA will show them that the U.S. wont leave them in the lurch. TPAs skeptics say they get all this, but dont want to give more authority to President Obama because they dont trust him. Well, neither do I. TPA doesnt give the president authority. TPA holds the president accountable. The only way a deal gets an up-or-down vote is if it meets Congresss stipulations. And the truth is, other countries wont wait for the U.S. to elect a new president. The world is writing the rules of the global economy right now. Either we seize this opportunity, or we will lose it. With so much at stake, if the House rejects TPA, it will announce to the world that America is unreliable. But if the House approves TPA, it will underscore Americas commitment to a successful negotiation and reassert Americas leading role in world affairs. After years of indecision, no puffed-up posture can enhance Americas stature. Only concrete actions can rebuild U.S. credibility. And number one on the to-do list is establishing TPA.

Women Build is a program for women to learn construction skills and help build homes for families in need of adequate housing.  I was honored to join a group of mostly women in helping frame a three-bedroom, two-bath house for Estela Flores, a single mother of three. Estela was chosen  as a one of Skagit Habitats partner families, allowing her help to build a home and purchase it at cost with a low-interest mortgage. She has committed to putting 500 hours of sweat equity into her home, as well as attending financial literacy and home maintenance classes  all while raising her family and working. Today, there are too many families like Estelas who need assistance becoming homeowners. I believe Congress needs to work on providing better access to affordable housing, expand job training programs and increase the federal minimum wage so that the American Dream is a reality for all Americans. Congress must work together to help our families and homeowners, and I will continue fighting to ensure that families like Estelas have access to the opportunities they deserve.

,114,Male,N00026160,43416,"Price, Tom (Rep.) [R-GA6]","Congressman Tom Price First Quarter Economic Report* On Friday, it was widely reported that our economy shrank last quarter by 0.7%. After more than six years of President Obamas higher taxes and regulatory schemes, we have an economy that remains weak and plagued with uncertainty. And all his administration is proposing is more of the same  more taxes and more government-made barriers to growth and opportunity. This new normal is unacceptable. That is why we need the President to work with this Congress that has put forth a balanced budget and pro-growth policies that will spur desperately needed growth. Obama's Out-of-Control EPA* The Obama Administration is at it again  expanding Washingtons regulatory power at the expense of families and businesses. The latest outrageous scheme from the EPA regarding water regulations is an obvious abuse of authority and a direct threat to the individual and economic freedom of the American people. This no longer just effects hard working farmers and business owners; this rule could effectively harm anyone who owns a backyard. That is why the House voted in a bipartisan manner earlier this month to halt this egregious action by the Administration. Read more about this new rule in this Wall Street Journal [link 1] story.

[D-DC0]","Congresswoman Nortons e-Newsletter June 1, 2015 After NPS Announces Memorial Bridge Lane Closures and Weight Restrictions, Introducing a Bill to Fund Federal Infrastructure Assets I have been working for a month on the Save Our National Parks Transportation Act, which I will introduce today, authorizing $460 million a year for the National Park Service (NPS) for the federal lands transportation program for fiscal years 2016 to 2021, and establishing a program called the Nationally Significant Federal Lands and Tribal Transportation Project program, funded at $150 million each fiscal year from 2016 to 2021. My bill comes after NPS last week announced weight restrictions and sidewalk and lane closures on the Arlington Memorial Bridge, which went into effect on May 29. We have known for years that Memorial Bridge was structurally deficient, but after years of shameful congressional neglect, NPS was forced to make these drastic but necessary moves, which will cause a headache for residents, commuters, and tourists. The Metro bus ban will cause major inconvenience. Tragically, one of our nations most iconic bridges has become a national symbol of the crisis facing the nations most important infrastructure. The cost of rebuilding the bridge is $250 million, but NPS only receives $240 million annually for its transportation projects nationwide, so it is no wonder they have not been able to begin vital repairs on Memorial Bridge. Federal roads and bridges like the Memorial Bridge must be 100% funded by the federal government, not from states allocations. These vital roads and bridges have become federal orphans, an unacceptable reality that the public must help us change. I will highlight the details of my bill and bring attention to the critical condition of Memorial Bridge, along with the rest of our nations crumbling infrastructure, at a press conference on the bridge itself today at noon. I will be joined by Congressman Don Beyer (D-VA) and Senator Tim Kaine (D-VA), U.S. Interior Secretary Sally Jewell, U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx, and NPS Director Jonathan Jarvis. Congress has kicked the can down the road for so long that this watershed Memorial Bridge moment must galvanize Congress into action. Court Ruling on D.C. Budget Autonomy Referendum Raises New Issues, But I Am Defending It From Congressional Interference Last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit vacated (canceled) a federal district courts decision that held that the budget autonomy referendum approved by D.C. voters in 2013 was invalid. That means budget autonomy is in effect for now, but along with city officials, we are trying to figure out what the remand to a local court means. This case is not over. Therefore, I will continue my efforts to stop Congress from blocking or overturning the referendum, including during the upcoming appropriations process. The court decision highlights the urgent need for Congress to pass our D.C. budget autonomy bill, which has bipartisan, bicameral support in Congress and from the President. The District deserves the right to control its locally raised revenue like every other jurisdiction in the U.S.  a central feature of democratic self-government in our country. Another Major Step Toward St. Elizabeths DHS Campus Consolidation While Improving Shepherd Parkway for the Community I was pleased to announce last week that the National Park Service has transferred eight acres located in Shepherd Parkway to the U.S. General Services Administration (GSA) to use to make infrastructure improvements needed to accommodate the next phase of U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS) consolidation at St. Elizabeths in Ward 8. The transfer of these eight acres is not a small matter. These acres are essential for the DHS consolidation to move to the next stage. I was also particularly pleased that the GSA construction will rescue Shepherd Parkway from dumping, an issue the community and I have been working to eliminate for months to make Shepherd Parkway a pleasant park experience for the neighborhood. This is a win-win for the community and the DHS campus will be an economic boon for the city. After Five Decades of Failed Cuba Policy, a Major Step Toward Normalizing Relations Last Friday, the U.S. State Department officially removed Cuba from the list of state sponsors of terrorism. This action, long overdue, is a pivotal step toward bringing U.S.-Cuba relations into the realities of the 21st century. Cuba is still an undemocratic nation, but it is not a state sponsor of terrorism. Encouraging open channels of information and contact between our two countries is the best way to grow democracy in Cuba. We have a long way to go toward normalization, and my faith in American democracy as a model for the world leads me to believe that opening the doors to diplomatic relations and allowing the Cuban people to deal directly with the American people cannot fail to inspire democracy even in Cuba.

Trade Promotion Authority, or TPA, is a process that creates a partnership between Congress and the administration that ensures the United States secures the most effective trade agreements possible. TPA also brings greater transparency to the negotiating process by empowering Congress to conduct vigorous oversight and hold the administration accountable. Does TPA give the president special authority? No. According to the U.S. Constitution, the president can negotiate any trade deal he wants. TPA defines Congressional objectives and priorities, as well as, establishes consultation, notification, and transparency requirements for trade deals. The non-partisan Congressional Research Service even reiterated in a recent report that TPA gives the president no new authority. You can read the full report here. Doesnt TPA cede our sovereignty? No. For the first time TPA legislation makes clear that trade agreements cannot change U.S. law without congressional action. First, the bill ensures that any provision of a trade agreement that is inconsistent with federal or state law will have no effect. Second, it states specifically that federal and state laws will prevail in the event of a conflict with a trade agreement. Third, it affirms the president cant unilaterally change U.S. law. What happens if the trade deals arent good for the U.S. economy? Congress always has the ability to defeat a trade bill during an up or down vote. However, unlike TPA bills of the past, this bill contains an unprecedented safeguard that allows for TPA to be turned off for a particular trade agreement. If either the House Ways and Means Committee or the Senate Finance Committee determines that the president hasnt met the goals or conditions prescribed in TPA, either committee could trigger a Consultation and Compliance Resolution. This resolution provides a mechanism for either the House or Senate to remove TPA procedures for a trade agreement. Arent trade deals secret? The Bipartisan Trade Priorities and Accountability Act, the current TPA bill, has the most robust transparency and consultation requirements of any previously passed TPA. The administration would have to consult closely with Congress before, during, and after negotiations. The administration would be required to publish detailed and comprehensive summaries of the specific objectives trade negotiators are seeking and keep such summaries up to date as negotiations continue. The administration would be required to consult upon request with any Member of Congress and provide access to the classified negotiating texts of all trade negotiations to any Member and their qualified staff. The current TPA measure would require that the text of any trade deal must be made available for Congress and the public to read for at least 60 days before the president signs it. Remember, when Democrats passed the Affordable Care Act in 2010 changing our nations health care system for all Americans, Members of Congress didnt even have 60 hours to read the 3,000 page bill, let alone the minimum of 60 days that will be mandated for the text of trade deals to be made public. Passing TPA ensures that trade deals are not negotiated in the dark and there is ample opportunity to read every trade deal. Would Ohio benefit? Trade already supports one in five Ohio jobs. Goods and services produced in our state are shipped to more than 200 countries, while just 20 nations the United States has trade agreements with received half of Ohios total exports. Over the past 10 years Ohios goods exports have increased by 37 percent to our free trade partners. Trade agreements are already fueling growth; imagine the potential if the U.S. enters into new trade agreements. With 95 percent of the worlds customers living outside of the United States, Ohio businesses must have access to these customers to grow. In fact, Ohioans wont just benefit from Ohio companies growth, companies that are major Ohio employers like Honda will benefit from trade agreements as well. The Organization for International Investment estimates that if trade agreements with the Asian-Pacific region and the European Union are implemented, more than 52,000 Ohio jobs will be created by companies with headquarters overseas, pumping another $6.3 billion into the states economy. When the United States enters into trade agreements, Ohios exporters are able to better compete leading to job creation and economic growth.

,114,Male,N00021207,43438,"Nolan, Richard (Rep.) [D-MN8]","Monday Report from Representative Rick Nolan top banner      Postal Consolidations are a Deliberate Plan to Cut Service   Click the image above to read more about our press conference in the Duluth News Tribune. Dear Friend, Under the guise of consolidation and saving money, the Postal Service is executing a major nationwide policy change - a deliberate plan to shift from the overnight delivery we've had for decades to something closer to a week and more - without the approval of Congress or the President. At a press conference and rally last week in Duluth, I called on Postmaster General Megan Brennan to reverse the decision to consolidate the Duluth Processing and Distribution Facility, keep our hard working postal employees working in the remarkably efficient regional distribution centers and permanently restore top quality service across our nation. Moreover, we made it clear that Congress needs to call a nationwide halt to a wave of post office consolidations that could be a death nil for the U.S. Postal Service as we know it. The situation in Duluth is a clear case in point. Since the postal facility began shifting its sorting operations to the Twin Cities, service from what was once among the nation's most efficient state of the art facilities is deteriorating rapidly. Businesses are suffering. Consumers are complaining. Some postal employees are being forced to travel hours back and forth to work. It's taking up to six days to deliver a letter from one end of Duluth to the other. And no one - least of all the Postal Service - is saving any money. Delivery horror stories abound. Just prior to our rally and news conference last Wednesday, we stopped to visit with Jake Benson and Diane Giuliani, publishers of the weekly Proctor Journal, Hermantown Star and Floodwood Forum newspapers. They're keeping a list of customer complaints - the April 30 edition delivered on May 21; the May 7 edition delivered May 22; many more complaints of newspapers previously delivered in two days that now take two weeks to reach local mailboxes. Jake's situation is typical of how small businesses all over the nation are being hurt by ill-conceived, inefficient and wasteful postal consolidations.  Jake Benson and Diane Giuliani keep a list of customers complaining of delivery delays since the Duluth postal facility began consolidation on April 18th of this year. Back in Washington this week, we are drafting legislation to keep the Duluth postal facility and similar operations throughout the country open permanently, with services restored and employees back on the job. This is a tough fight, but it's a fight worth having. We will keep you posted as events proceed. Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts. Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below or send me an  email  . Sincerely,  _____ A Project for the Generations  Senator Amy Klobuchar, MnDOT Commissioner Charlie Zelle, USDOT Maritime Administrator Paul ""Chip"" Jaenichen, Port Authority Board President Steve Raukar and Port Authority Executive Director Vanta Coda joined me (at the far right) in breaking ground for the Duluth Intermodal Project - the largest infrastructure development project on the waterfront in 50 years. One generation's best job is to pave the way for the next - so it was such an honor to be part of last week's groundbreaking for the Port of Duluth Intermodal Project - revitalizing Duluth's working waterfront with the largest effort undertaken by the Port Authority in 50 years. The Port of Duluth is already a tremendous economic driver for the region - supporting some 12,000 jobs, $545 million in annual wages and $1.5 billion in business and economic development every year. This project will create countless more jobs by making our region even more competitive in the global marketplace. It's amazing to realize that people who haven't been born yet will move products that haven't been invented yet using these facilities. And it's been quite an effort - so many people, including three Port directors, demonstrating unbelievable dedication and persistence over 26 years and five federal ""TIGER"" grant applications to get to last week's groundbreaking. Along with Senators Franken and Klobuchar, we were glad to help secure the lion's share of federal funding through that $10 million federal grant - and advance prosperity for generations to come. _____ Railroad Safety Issues Hit Close to Home  The International Falls Journal featured this photo of the burned and collapsed bridge.Thanks to crew, the fire fighters and other first responders who worked quickly to bring this situation under control. Bridges are falling down and trains are falling into our rivers, threatening lives and our environment right here in northern Minnesota. And yet, there is no federal program to inspect the nation's 100,000 rapidly aging railroad bridges. These wooden structures are actually catching on fire and falling down - as we saw first hand last week when a Canadian National Railway (CN) trestle burst into flames and collapsed, derailing part of a train carrying farm fertilizer just south of International Falls. The cars remained in tact, caught up in the bridge wreckage over the Rat Root River. Investigators termed the cause a ""mechanical failure"" - but we're told that old wooden railroad bridges are known to spontaneously catch fire when sparks from rail cars smolder and conditions are just right. If that train had been carrying some of the 21 million barrels of oil that come over those tracks from Canada at I-Falls/Ranier every year, the damage to the Rat Root River and its watersheds could have been incalculable. Counting on luck is no way to govern a nation. Last week's accident points to the urgent need for Speaker Boehner to get out of the way and allow the Transportation Committee to write a long-term bill to rebuild and revitalize our nation's infrastructure - including tough new regulations and resources to inspect our railroad systems and pipelines and ensure that hazardous materials can be moved safely from point A to point B. Railroad Workers Press Safety Concerns  We discussed a wide range of railroad safety issues with representatives of the United Transportation Workers Union (UTU) last week in Proctor. Meanwhile, just hours after the accident, we met with officials of the Federal Railroad Administration (FRA) and the United Transportation Workers (UTU) to discuss a host of rail safety concerns I will be taking back to my colleagues on the House Railroad subcommittee. Among the points raised, workers expressed particular alarm over lack of snow removal on tracks after big winter storms. They cited recent incidents near Duluth and Two Harbors where trains slid down hills over snow-covered tracks, temporarily and dangerously out of control and narrowly averting busy highways. With no federal regulations requiring the nation's railroads to establish or implement safety plans, they cited numerous situations where the need for speed routinely takes precedence over safety. Congress largely deregulated the railroads in the 1970's to help make them more profitable and efficient - not to disregard the health and safety of workers. We will continue to raise these issues on the House Transportation Committee and the Railroad Subcommittee, and press for tougher standards to keep accidents from happening. _____ Making it in America - At Lake States Lumber  Thanks to Jay Baker, Head of Operations and Steve Wilson, Vice President and owner at Lake States Lumber for a good discussion and tour of their Duluth facility. Having once owned my own forest products company, it was really enjoyable to tour Lake States Lumber in Duluth last week and see the wide range of sidings, decking, roofing and other products their 235 employees - including 33 in Duluth and 95 in Aitkin - produce and send all over the nation. The 2014 Farm Bill included my amendment to expand research into new uses for forest products, and this company is one of the most innovative and environmentally progressive operations I've seen in a long time. They're growing fast, and doing a commendable job of providing good job opportunities for, among others, people who have experienced past difficulties and challenges and need a fresh start in life. _____ Help a Vet Make History  This great project works to maintain the incredible stories of our nation's veterans and saves them to share with generations to come. The Veterans History Project collects and shares first-hand accounts of U.S. veterans and civilians who supported them in World War I, World War II, the Korean War, Vietnam War, Persian Gulf War, and Afghanistan and Iraq conflicts. Civilian supporters include war industry workers, USO workers, flight instructors, medical volunteers, and others. Veterans and their families, interviewers, and students can participate and contribute to the project by clicking here  to register.  We honored America's heroes at the Brained Memorial Day ceremony last month - and I was happy to have the opportunity to visit with WWII Bataan Death March survivor, old family friend and local hero Walt Straka. _____ Our Week in Mille Lacs  Our field representative Rick Olseen visited DaVita Health Care Partners Inc. for the grand opening of their Isle Minnesota Mille Lacs Dialysis last week. This facility provides dialysis services for patients with kidney failure to a rural part of the 8th Congressional District where patients have had to travel long distances for their care in the past. Isle Mayor Linda Dahlen joined Cari Dock from DaVita and the facility staff to cut the ribbon. Our Week in Eveleth  We made a pit stop in Eveleth to get an update on current Range economic issues and plans from Mark Phillips, Commissioner of the Iron Range Resources and Rehabilitation Board (IRRRB). _____ Coming Up in Washington This week: . Congress will take up funding bills for the Departments of Commerce and Judiciary as well as science funding in several agencies. We may also consider additional funding for Housing, Urban Development and Transportation. . Significant funding cuts in these agencies could make it difficult for these measures to pass the House floor - the Senate may make also modifications to the extension of the Patriot Act and send that back to the House, as we grapple to balance personal privacy with the government's need for legal tools to combat terrorism. _____ Finally... A Note from the Editor  We visited the Proctor Journal headquarters - and I got a small taste of what it's like to be the editor. Ben Franklin advised his political friends never to get into an argument with someone who buys ink by the barrel. I have often thought someday I would like to own and edit my own weekly newspaper. During our visit last week, Proctor Journal publisher Jake Benson let me try out his chair - and it felt pretty darn good. _____ Nolan in the news...

In the immediate aftermath of this terrible disaster, many families took the help that was offered by the federal government, including loans from the Small Business Administration. Unfortunately, we're discovering that those SBA loans counted against a family's RREM award, leaving them tens of thousands of dollars short for completion of their construction projects. My bill, the Disaster Survivor Benefit Clarification Act, would amend existing law to ensure that getting a loan from the Small Business Administration doesn't prohibit a family from getting other kinds of financial assistance after a disaster. A loan that has to be repaid with interest should not prevent a family from receiving a grant. This is the second bill  I've introduced to help Sandy victims. Learn more about my bill by watching this clip from CBS below:  Around the District  Great to meet with Pine Beach Councilman Barry Weick and the very impressive Boy Scout troop!  I was honored to be the commencement speaker at Burlington County College. I spoke about how important it is to grasp the opportunities that life presents us.

,114,Male,N00032029,43583,"Griffith, Morgan (Rep.) [R-VA9]","Its About the Constitution The Constitution  Still Relevant The Senate debate on collecting all our phone data has been interesting. Hopefully the American people have a better understanding of their rights and of the importance of the Congressional power to check the Executive branch. Government Control of Water  An Update On May 27, the Obama Administration announced it had finalized its Clean Water Rule, commonly known as the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule. Proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers, this controversial rule redefines the scope of waters protected under the Clean Water Act. In doing so, it vastly expands EPAs authority over various wet areas. According to U.S. News and World Report, The Clean Water Rule reportedly upholds exemptions for agriculture. However, some tributaries that may be dry for prolonged periods but feed larger waterways when flooded will be covered by the new rule, federal officials said. In other words, a dry branch that only gets water during a gully washer or a spot in your yard that gets squishy during prolonged rain could now be subject to EPA regulation and control. Many mines are being shuttered, and now the EPA wants to control our land as well. It is my opinion this taking, if not paid for by the federal government, is unconstitutional. Also, it should be noted the American Farm Bureau Federation says the changes to the final rule are little more than window dressing. Others share my concerns. Last May, I joined 230 Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle in urging the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to withdraw their overreaching WOTUS rule. More recently, on May 12 of this year, the House of Representatives passed the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act (H.R. 1732), which would require the EPA to withdraw this rule. I supported this bill, as did 24 House Democrats. Additionally, 3 Democrat Senators have joined 27 Republican Senators in signing on in support of a different bill that also would restrict the WOTUS rule. I remain opposed to the WOTUS rule, and will continue working to fight this and other overreaching EPA actions. The Constitution and Obamacare  An Update Last week, a U.S. judge held the first major hearing regarding the lawsuit brought about by my colleagues and I in the House involving Administration actions in the implementation of the Obamacare health care law. We believe the Administration has unlawfully bypassed Congress while implementing Obamacare. As Reuters notes, At issue are executive changes authorizing Treasury payments to healthcare insurers without the funding being agreed by Congress and delaying implementation of the law's employer mandate, which required employers with more than 50 employees to provide healthcare coverage. The Administration last week argued this lawsuit should be dismissed, contending the House lacks standing to sue. So it is your position that if the House of Representatives affirmatively voted not to fund something ... then that vote can be ignored by the administration, because after all, no one can sue them? asked Judge Rosemary Collyer of the U.S. District Court for the District of Columbia. I want you to explain ... why it's not an insult to the Constitution?, she also said. Judge Collyer had not decided on the standing issue before her last week, nor did she say when she expects to rule. Regardless, as a Member of the House of Representatives, it is my sworn duty to protect the rights and freedoms afforded us by our Constitution, and to steadfastly defend our system of checks and balances. It doesnt matter whether I like the law or whether the President likes the law. Once passed by Congress and signed into law, it is the Presidents job to faithfully execute the law unless changed by Congress. A Government Gun Registration List? More than two thousand bills have been introduced this Congress. Some of these bills might earn my support. Others I would certainly oppose. Consider the recently-introduced Firearm Risk Protection Act (H.R. 2546). According to the Washington Times, The Firearm Risk Protection Act would subject gun owners to a $10,000 fine if they ignored a mandate for liability insurance before obtaining a weapon, The Hill reported Friday. This bill is a backdoor way of creating an unconstitutional government gun registration list. Put simply, I would strongly oppose and fight against this legislation.

No one could have predicted the destructive floods that hit Texans from the Hill Country to Houston. Too many lives were lost and many are still missing. My thoughts and prayers are with everybody affected by this tragedy. This disaster again revealed the true Texan spirit. Texans act immediately and drop everything in order to help a neighbor in need. Over the weekend, I visited First Baptist Church in Richmond. They have teamed up with the American Red Cross to open a shelter for those displaced by the flooding along the Brazos River. I applaud the Fort Bend County Office of Emergency Management for their emergency preparedness and for actively monitoring the flood situation. I am humbled to serve a community that supports each other so willingly during this time of need.

[R-KS1]","Congressman Tim Huelskamp ----------------------------------- [image = ENews Banner2.JPG] * *Protecting America's Food Supply** On Wednesday, I was able to attend the groundbreaking ceremony for the new National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility (NBAF), which will be built adjacent to Kansas State University in Manhattan. This state-of-the-art biosecurity lab will serve the nation by replacing the antiquated research facility at Plum Island, N.Y., which is has a very limited capacity to respond to threats. As a result, the U.S. currently relies on Canada and Australia to conduct some of our most important research into securing our food supply. Ive been working to get NBAF approved and finalized since I was in the Kansas State Senate. It's been a long road, and this groundbreaking comes not a day too soon. Farmers and ranchers in Kansas depend on the reliability of the U.S. food supply to sell our products around the world. When NBAF is completed, the U.S. will no longer be outsourcing its highest level research to other countries. Kansas State, which will work closely with the facility, is already leading the way in food safety. Just this past week the University announced theyve developed vaccines for strains of avian flu that can be transmitted from poultry to humans. For our national security and the safety of our food supply, it is critical that we finish NBAF construction as soon and safely as possible. [image =  * *Much Less Drought in Kansas** Kansas is in a much better position regarding rainfall than last year at this time. Take a look at these two drought maps. [image = 2015 Drought.JPG] The EPA is trying to rain on our parade though. Theyre trying to expand their authority to regulate water in road ditches, farm ponds, prairie potholes, swimming pools, water tanks, or even rain puddles. As I was driving around to Town Halls last week, I was thinking about getting a picture with one of these puddles or ditches that the EPA wants to regulate. The problem was that many are already dry! Working together with a bipartisan group of members of Congress, I am fighting against this absurd notion. This month, we passed H.R. 1732, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act, to stop this radical EPAs Waters of the U.S. rule. * *Town Halls** During my time in Kansas last week, I was able to host several more Town Halls, bringing my total number of Town Halls to 293. Im honored to host these meetings and hear from you about the federal government. Trust me, even though Kansans appreciate my common sense and my battles to protect our Veterans, our freedoms, and our future -- we have so much more to do. Here are a few pictures.

,114,Male,N00035346,43683,"Carter, Buddy (Rep.) [R-GA1]","Appeals Court Blocks Amnesty Executive Orders Last week, the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit denied the Obama Administrations request to lift a hold on the presidents executive actions on immigration to grant amnesty. The ruling comes in a lawsuit by 26 states, including Georgia, aimed at permanently stopping the executive orders. In February, United States District Judge Andrew Hanen granted a preliminary injunction on the executive orders temporarily placing them on hold. The appeals court last week found that the states do have sufficient legal grounds to bring the lawsuit, pushing the lawsuit forward in the legal process and continuing the ban on the administrations implementation of the unprecedented executive actions. This is a big win in our fight to stop the presidents blatant overreach on amnesty. The Fifth Circuit has provided yet another warning to the president that he will not get away with unilaterally rewriting our nations immigration laws. Every branch of government  including President Obama himself  has made clear that this approach to backdoor amnesty is unconstitutional. I've been fighting against the Obama Administrations plan to grant amnesty to illegal immigrants. I have voted twice to reject any funding for the executive orders and I recently joined this court battle by signing an amicus brief to support the lawsuit brought by the states. I look forward to seeing this case progress. Rest assured, I will remain steadfast in my fight to stand for the rule of law and restore the balance of power laid out in the Constitution. From our Nation's Capitol XXI Monday, May 25, 2015: It was indeed an honor to address the graduating class of First Presbyterian Christian Academy in Hinesville on Saturday. This fine group of 13 seniors is some of the best and brightest in our community and I look forward with great anticipation to the future accomplishments I am certain they all will achieve. Today is Memorial Day and I am honored to be speaking at two services this morning. All across America, and certainly here in the First District, memorials and parks have been built to honor our veterans and those who have given the ultimate price for our country. I begin in Bloomingdale where I am joined by my good friend, retiring Emmy Award winning news anchor Sonny Dixon, who does his usual outstanding job leading the service despite some light rain. Afterwards I head over to Richmond Hill where, alongside Mayor Harold Fowler, I have the opportunity to participate in their service at J.F. Gregory Park. Later that afternoon, Amy and I travel down to St. Simons Island to participate in the Rotary Clubs annual Taps at Twilight service. This wonderful event, held overlooking the Atlantic Ocean, is a mix of patriotic music and inspirational messages. This year we hear from retired Gen. Jim Livingston from Towns, Georgia, who delivers an outstanding message. Tuesday, May 26, 2015: My day begins with a visit to the Pooler location of Atlantic Radiology where I have the opportunity to meet with physicians and staff to discuss the challenges facing this important medical service. Next I head to the groundbreaking ceremony of the I-95 welcome center in Port Wentworth where I am joined by a number of elected officials as well as those with interests in transportation and tourism. This much needed project will provide a great welcome mat for those visitors entering our state from South Carolina traveling south on I-95 and would not have been possible without the tireless efforts of First District Board of Transportation member Ann Purcell. Next, I meet with Savannah businessman and Cuban American Mario de la Guardia, Sr. to discuss my pending trip to Cuba later this week. Wednesday, May 27, 2015: I have often said that the First Congressional District is an area rich in history and tradition but perhaps our greatest times still lie ahead of us. This is certainly true today in Richmond Hill and Bryan County as we celebrate the grand opening of Caesarstone, a leading developer and manufacturer of premium quartz surfaces. This is the Israeli based companys third production facility and first in the United States and will create around 200 jobs in Bryan County. After this momentous event, I meet with Israeli Consul General to the Southeast Opher Airan, who is usually in Atlanta but is in the area to attend the grand opening of this fine Israeli company. Afterwards, I head to the Savannah-Hilton Head Airport to meet with Executive Director Greg Kelly and board member Shirley James to discuss federal issues impacting the airport and to tour their security services. I also have the opportunity to meet with local TSA director James Scott for a tour of their facilities before boarding a flight to Miami where I will spend the night before traveling to Cuba tomorrow morning. Thursday, May 28, 2015 - Sunday, May 31, 2015: I am spending this weekend in Cuba with four other Members of Congress as guests of the Center for Democracy in the Americas, a non-profit group whose mission is to improve relations between the United States and Latin American countries. Including a business trip to Canada many years ago, this is only the second time I have ever been out of the country. During my time in Cuba, I had the opportunity to meet with Cuban officials, tour key infrastructure projects, and interact with the citizens of Cuba. It is important and I am thankful I had the opportunity to take this trip as the Obama Administration is attempting to move forward with vast changes on the relations of our nations and ending Americas embargo on their country. These actions will have immense impacts and its important Congress is educated on the repercussions. I will have more to report on the trip and my thoughts on US-Cuba relations in the coming days.

[R-TX19]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email  News from Representative Randy Neugebauer   June 1, 2015 Keeping Your Personal Information Secure Over the past several years, millions of Americans have been the victim of identity theft and financial fraud. In fact, in just the last two years, roughly 1 in 3 Americans had financial account information compromised in data breaches at our largest retailers. In our increasingly global marketplace, immense amounts of sensitive consumer financial information are transferred, processed and stored in any one transaction. This payments system includes credit card companies, retailers and banks. As the system is only as strong as its weakest link, I believe all participants must share equally in the efforts to keep our financial information secure and our economy better protected from future threats. A national threat to our economy and our security requires a national solution. With that in mind, I recently introduced H.R. 2205, the Data Security Act of 2015, to establish a national data security and breach notification standard for everyone in the payment chain to better protect your most sensitive financial information. As a former Lubbock small business owner, I understand the consequences of one-size-fits-all red tape. That is why the standards in my bill take into consideration the size, scope, and type of financial information businesses hold-to avoid unnecessary burdens on Main Street small businesses. Under my bill, many Main Street businesses across the 19th District may already be taking the necessary security precautions and will see no changes to the way they operate. Finally, the standards in my bill do not impact technology and allow the private sector to continue what it does best-innovate. Today and every day this year, there will be 117,334 cyber incidents against the United States economy according to a PriceWaterhouseCooper study. It is time we modernize our laws to keep up with this evolving threat to our economic and national security. I will continue to fight to protect your most sensitive financial information and create a climate where Main Street businesses can lead the economic surge for a more prosperous future.

Another EPA Power Grab Last week, the EPA finalized the agency's Waters of the United States Rule (WOTUS)-greatly expanding what is considered ""navigable water"" under federal jurisdiction to include even runoff ditches and stock ponds on our private property. I am outraged that the Obama administration has once again ignored the input from America's farmers and ranchers and moved forward with this power grab. Last month, I was pleased to support House passage of the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act (H.R. 1732), to prevent the Obama administration from moving forward on the WOTUS rule and require the EPA to actually listen to the input of those most affected by this unprecedented federal overreach. This rule is bad for TX19 and I will continue to fight back against it. A Victory for Texas and the Constitution Last week, the 5th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals issued a ruling against President Obama's executive amnesty. I believe this ruling is a major victory of Texas, our system of checks and balances, and the Constitution. I was proud to join an amicus brief supporting Texas' challenge and I am pleased that the rule of law once again prevailed. We must continue to hold the Obama administration accountable and put a stop to the President's unconstitutional and unilateral actions.  Not a Roundup Subscriber Yet? Sign up here!

,114,Male,N00031253,43646,"Rothfus, Keith (Rep.) [R-PA12]","Congressman Keith Rothfus Dear Lindsey, Weeks ago, I signed an Amicus Brief [link 1]in support of Texas and twenty-five other states that filed suit against President Obamas executive immigration orders, which grant amnesty to more than four million illegal immigrants. The brief asked the court to protect the balance of powers and the Constitution, which gives Congress exclusive authority to create new laws. As I have said all along, the President must not be allowed to brazenly disregard our laws, circumvent Congress, and ignore the will of the American people. I am pleased to report that last Tuesday, the Fifth Circuit Federal Court of Appeals upheld a freeze preventing the President from implementing his unlawful amnesty programs. This is the second such court ruling, wherein the judges found [link 2]that these controversial executive orders go well beyond the immigration laws authorized by Congress, and should not be allowed to go into effect until Texas legal challenge has moved through the courts. The court stated that the Presidents orders would give lawful presence to up to four million illegal aliens and that such status triggers eligibility for federal and state benefits that would not otherwise be available. These benefits range from work authorization to social security retirement benefits, social security disability benefits, and health insurance under Part A of the Medicare program. The Fifth Circuit Courts ruling comes as no surprise. It only affirms what President Obama himself admitted on twenty-two separate occasions that this notion that somehow he can just change the laws unilaterally is just not true. [link 3]Rest assured, I will continue to follow this case closely and lend my support to the states that are fighting back against these actions, which amount to amnesty through executive fiat. As always, I welcome your feedback and encourage you to share your concerns. Please send me an email [link 4]or contact one of my local district offices [link 5]if I can help. Sincerely, Keith *Showcasing All Johnstown and Western Pennsylvania Have To Offer:* The Showcase for Commerce made for an exciting week in Johnstown. I am always proud to be a part of the events that help promote the highly-skilled workforce and feature the great work our men and women do to support our military. *CamTran Committed To Innovation:* During the Showcase for Commerce, CamTran unveiled their first compressed natural gas (CNG) bus. Converting vehicle fleets to CNG is creating a whole new market for Pennsylvanias natural gas and supporting job creation. *Visit To The 1-104th ARB With Senator Casey:* Last Thursday, I visited with Commander Wallace and the talented aircrews at the 1-104th in Johnstown. After a years-long effort to transfer the Apache Helicopters out of the National Guard, we have made strides in the House to delay any further asset transfers out of the 1-104th in Johnstown.  *Derry Area Students Dedicate Veterans Memorial:* Students not yet old enough to serve their country, with great care and loving labor, carved out a little piece of history where the stories of those who sacrificed can be remembered and shared. I was honored to attend the grand opening of their Veterans Memorial in Derry last Friday, and congratulate them for completing a project of such proportion. For years to come, visitors can look up to the American flag at the center, and reflect that freedom came at a high cost. *Coffee With Keith At Ice Cream World To Kick Off The Summer*: It was a great turnout at the Coffee With Keith last Tuesday.

This weekend, I joined Lake County officials, school administrators, teachers, and parents to congratulate the graduates of South Lake High School in Groveland. The motto for the Class of 2015 was If you want something youve never had, you have to do something youve never done. I wish each of these students great success as they pursue their dreams in our great land of American opportunity. ____________________  On Saturday, I provided the keynote commencement address at Cornerstone University of Florida and the Lighthouse High School Graduation. During the ceremony, the university awarded me with an Honorary Doctoral Degree in gratitude for my service in the area of religious freedom and other humanitarian efforts. ____________________  Despite the cost overruns and unnecessary delays, the Orlando VA Medical Center hosted its ribbon cutting and grand opening on Tuesday. For years, the construction was mired in bureaucratic red tape and administrative errors, and I am glad to finally have the hospital available to serve our veterans. This facility will go a long way towards ensuring vets in our community receive the timely care they deserve. ____________________  I began working on transportation and infrastructure issues in 1980 when I was first elected to the Florida Legislature. Now, decades later, some of those projects are still being improved to aid travel for Central Florida individuals, families, and businesses. This past week, I had the privilege to participate in the ribbon cutting for the Schofield Road Interchange on State Road 429 (Daniel Webster Western Beltway). The interchange is the first project completed by the new Central Florida Expressway Authority. Your servant,  Daniel Webster Member of Congress     Constituent Corner Recently, a constituent from Mount Dora contacted my office regarding an issue with the Office of Personnel Management (OPM). After her husband had passed away, the constituents benefits and insurance were cancelled, and she was told that it would take months to reinstate them. Very concerned about her medical conditions and still grieving from the loss of her husband, the constituent called to see if we could assist in expediting the process. My office submitted an inquiry along with letters from her doctors requesting that her benefits be expedited. Shortly afterwards, we received notification that all issues were resolved and the constituent would begin receiving benefits. OPM also said that any outstanding insurance claims could now be resubmitted and that there was no gap of coverage. Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you. Survey Based on our intelligence and advice from top commanders, the Obama Administration has allowed for continued air strikes against the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). However, the militant terrorists continue to grow and advance. Do you believe that the United States should be doing more to stop these terrorist groups in the Middle East? * Yes  * No  * I don't know  Submit your Response  Response from the previous survey question  , ""Based on personal experience, second-hand knowledge, or mere perception how would you rate the VA service in Central Florida?"" Excellent - 16% Satisfactory - 43% Unacceptable - 41% Legislative Update Last week, we honored the memory of men and women who have given their lives to protect our liberty and freedom. In our generation, those who fear freedom have chosen to use terror as a weapon. Today, members of our military are protecting us from ruthless Islamic extremists who are seeking to undermine the cause of freedom and cause harm to our country. Yet the battle against terrorism is fought on many fronts. Last week, the U.S. Government removed Cuba from the list of State Sponsors of Terrorists. Despite the misgivings of Cuban Americans who fled from the tyranny of the Castro Regime, the Obama Administration is seeking to normalize relations with Cuba. It is a dangerous strategy to simply overlook the actions of a government who overtly terrorizes its own people. Congress also faces its own questions in the fight against terror. As the Patriot Act just expired last night, the debates continue on where to draw the balance between personal freedom, safety and security. Both the House and Senate will continue to debate the merit and pitfalls of this legislation in the coming days.

[D-IN7]","News from Representative Carson  WEBSITE  | CONTACT ME       Forward to a Friend  June 1, 2015 Dear Friend, Late last year, the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) announced its revised guidance to federal law enforcement on racial profiling. While the new guidelines included much-needed improvements, I believe significant work remains to realize former Attorney General Eric Holders goal of eliminating racial profiling once and for all. Thats why I recently signed a letter urging the DOJ to update the profiling guidance for law enforcement. The 2014 guidelines send a signal of federal concern, but they are not a replacement for the enactment of a comprehensive federal anti-profiling program. I am advocating for legislation that would ban profiling by federal, state, and local law enforcement, provide a mechanism for enforcement of this ban, mandate data collection by state and local law enforcement agencies that receive federal funds, and provide financial and technical support from the Department of Justice to law enforcement agencies to ensure that the best practices are deployed to fight unconstitutional profiling as outlined in the End Racial Profiling Act. I am committed to working with my colleagues and the Administration to ensure that everyone is treated equally and fairly before the law. It is an honor to serve you in Washington, if you have any questions, please feel free to contact my office.

Sign up  Friends, Updated technology and equipment are essential in training the next generation of military personnel. That's why we have been working to modernize the training fleet at the Army Aviation Center of Excellence at Fort Rucker.  A year ago, we secured the purchase of new Lakota helicopters to replace some of the Vietnam-era training helicopters on post. This past week, I was able to visit the Airbus facility just across state lines in Columbus, Miss., where the impressive new Lakota helicopters are manufactured. I had planned to ride along for the delivery of one of the Lakotas coming off the line directly to Fort Rucker, but rough weather grounded us. I did get to take a demonstration flight, and seeing these helicopters and technology firsthand gave me an even greater appreciation for the importance of keeping our military equipment up to date  .  You fight how you train, so it helps that the Lakota's dual engine, all-glass cockpit design is more like the aircraft our aviators will take into combat. I'm proud to support this fleet modernization and appreciate the opportunity to tour Airbus and see the new Lakotas heading to Rucker.   Coffee and Conversation: What a great crowd we had at our ""Coffee and Conversation"" event with Congressman Trey Gowdy  (R-S.C.) in Millbrook! I appreciate all of you who came out and engaged with us on a number of topics. I also want to thank Trey for his generosity in traveling down to Alabama and taking the time to meet my constituents. It's a pleasure to serve with such a strong, conservative leader, and I'm thrilled that you all were able to hear from him in person.  Good News for Alabama's Fisheries: If you've been fishing in the Gulf the last few years, you know how ridiculous the regulations and limits have become. That's particularly true with Red Snapper, a popular and plentiful species along the Gulf Coast. The reason is unnecessary and intrusive federal regulations that aren't good for fishermen or fish. Tonight the House acted to finally fix that by modernizing our law and giving states and regional regulators more flexibility to shift catch limits as water conditions change. The bill, H.R. 1335, ""The Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act,""  also works to increase transparency, empower local experts who have a greater knowledge of regional needs, give states more of a say in decisions affecting them and support job growth- all with no increase in federal spending. Fishing is not only a large recreational attraction in Alabama; it's also an important facet of our state's economy. I appreciate my colleague, Rep. Bradley Byrne's leadership on this issue, and I'm proud to be a part of this effort to make sense of our fishing laws. The Week Ahead: We have a number of bills coming to the floor for a vote this week including consideration of our fourth and fifth Appropriations bills. Read more below about these bills and important legislation affecting Alabama's fisheries: * H.R. 1335  - Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act (see above) * H.R. 2578  - Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016 * H.R. 2577  - Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016 Stay in Touch: You can keep up with the latest news by finding me on Facebook  and Twitter  where I post updates daily.

Last Wednesday marked the beginning of a new chapter for Kansas and for America, as the Department of Homeland Security broke ground on its foremost animal disease research facility in Manhattan, Kansas. The National Bio and Agro-Defense Facility, or NBAF, is a joint state and federal project I have been proud to fight for in my role on the House Appropriations Committee. NBAF will be replacing Plum Island Animal Disease Center in New York by 2023, making Kansas the front line for America's food security.  [image = Congressman Yoder giving remarks as DHS Secretary Jeh Johnson, USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack, and Senators Pat Roberts and Jerry Moran look on.  NBAF coming to Kansas also means an economic boon for the state and region. The facility will employ 350 full-time workers and is expected to bring in an additional 40 businesses and labs to the state, to a tune of $3.5 billion in economic activity over 20 years. This will boost an already robust animal health corridor that runs through the Kansas City metro area in the Third District.  [image = Congressman Yoder and his wife Brooke at the NBAF groundbreaking ceremony.  Wednesday's event showed the Kansas prairie spirit is alive and well.

[link 1] * Patriot Act Reauthorization* [image = Click here to watch a video of Congressman Yoder's interview with the *Topeka Capital-Journal*. [link 2] As the Senate considers the USA Freedom Act this week, it's important to remember that this legislation does not prevent federal agencies from searching our digital communications without a warrant. That is why we must pass the Email Privacy Act as soon as possible, to further extend our constitutional protections and bring our Fourth Amendment rights into the 21st Century. Additionally, the USA Freedom Act continues the heavily-criticized bulk data collection program. I voted against the bill in the House of Representatives because I dont believe it addresses the problem of searching and seizing Americans data without their knowledge and without any due process. I cannot and do not support the breach of our constitutional rights for one day, one year, or a decadeand will not support an extension of the Patriot Act without reforms necessary to ensure we protect the Fourth Amendment and the liberty of each American. * Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals Rules Against Executive Amnesty* [image = Click here to watch a *Kansas City Star* video of Congressman Yoder discussing the Administration's executive amnesty during a visit to Kansas City by USDA Secretary Tom Vilsack in February. [link 3] Earlier this year, I opposed funding for President Obama's executive order directing federal officials to ignore immigration laws on the books.  Consistent with that position, last week in a 2-1 decision in*Texas v. United States*, a three-judge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit upheld a Texas district court judges injunction preventing the programs from going into effect. The court ruled the injunction should remain in effect because Texas and the 25 additional states  including Kansas  made a compelling case they would suffer harm if the Administrations programs went into effect.  Weve now seen a higher court rule this Administrations decision to grant amnesty to millions of undocumented immigrants goes beyond the scope of the Presidents prosecutorial discretion under federal law. Its only a matter of time before this case is before the Supreme Court, and I trust that the highest court in the land will continue to uphold the constitution.  I would prefer to see the Administration stop wasting taxpayer dollars defending such a clear breach of its constitutional duties and instead come work with Congress on crafting legislation that will sensibly reform our immigration system. We should begin by enforcing all of the immigration laws on the books and ensuring that our borders are completely secure, as Congressional Republicans have insisted and the American people have demanded.

I believe in the Urban Leagues mission and know it will take continued leadership and support of organizations like the Urban League to make a difference in the Greater Kansas City area. Combatting poverty is going to take the entire community working together, but having such passionate leaders like Gwen Grant will greatly benefit Kansas City. * Jewish Community Relations Bureau/American Jewish Committee* [image = Congressman Yoder addressing the Jewish Community Relations Bureau/American Jewish Committee in Overland Park.

Those prospective students are making costly and critical decisions abouttheir education with very little or completely inaccurate information.

Duncan Hunter (R-CA) and has bipartisan support from co-sponsors Rep. Paul Ryan (R-WI), Rep. Trey Gowdy (R-SC), Rep. John Carney (D-DE), and Rep. Susan Davis (D-CA). The senate version of the bill was introduced by Senator Marco Rubio (R-FL).  The Student Right to Know Before You Go Act*would:* Empower students and families with the tools needed for a more complete picture of the value of their education Ensure accurate, easy to understand data be available online for prospective students and their families Free up information that currently exists, but is not currently accessible Match student records with employment and earnings data Ensure results would be highly accurate and informative Ensure privacy and security of student data  Going to school to learn new skills is one of the best ways to improve your quality of life. But it's also one of the most costly. Know Before You Go could help cut costs by giving students access to useful information that would help them make better-informed decisions about their education. Im excited to co-sponsor this commonsense reform.-*Rep. Paul Ryan** With the rising cost of higher education, families and students have to make tough decisions when planning for the future.

But for too long, weve seen nothing but bad results. Weve seen what so-called free trade agreements have done to our workers and our communities over the past two decades. Weve seen the factories close and the stores get boarded up. Thats why I voted against giving the president authority to rush through a huge new trade agreement, the Trans-Pacific Partnership. And its why Ill continue to fight for a level playing field for American workers and American businesses. Its true that trade deals have created jobs, and that the TPP could as well. But this ignores the millions more jobs that have been lost because of unfair trade deals. I like to look at things in baseball terms. Lauding gains from exports while ignoring a flood of imports  and skyrocketing trade deficits  is like reporting half of the score of a baseball game. The Cleveland Indians scoring three runs doesnt help the team much if the Yankees scored six runs. We know that past trade deals have replaced manufacturing jobswith good pay and good benefitswith low-wage service sector jobs. We cant let that happen again. And we also know that we make deals with countries that dont play by the same rules we dothey have lax labor and environmental standards, and what international rules they do have to follow too often get ignored. Thats why we cant have trade promotion without trade enforcement. Instead of rushing a bill through last month, the Senate should have taken the time to get this right and to include my important amendments that protect Ohio workers and manufacturers. I fought for provisions that would guarantee a level playing field for our workers and companies by cracking down on countries who manipulate their currencies, and that would give American businesses new tools to fight back against illegal foreign imports. I also fought to make sure China isnt able to sneak into this trade pact at a later date, without any oversight or Congressional approval. Im going to continue fighting to get these important protections to the presidents desk. This massive agreement could affect forty percent of the global economyit is too important to rush through. We know that trade done right can create prosperity. I want trade that lifts up Ohios middle class families and that creates good-paying jobsnot trade that leads to more shuttered plants and shattered communities. That can only happen when the rules arent rigged and we have a level playing field. Unfortunately, with the TPP we know which kind of trade were gettingthe kind the results in corporate handouts and worker sellouts.

For the third year in a row, my office sponsored the 52nd District Congressional Art Competition, and each year it has gotten bigger and better! This year we had 42 entries from 5 local high schools. After a review by some of San Diego's most highly regarded artists and curators, Carolyn Chu of Torrey Pines High School was chosen as the winner. Rachel Liu of Canyon Crest Academy was chosen as the Fan Favorite in a competition on our Facebook page and her piece will hang in my University City office.  Presenting a certificate to 52nd District Congressional Art Competition winner Carolyn Chu Helping Preserve Veterans' Stories for Future Generations Last week, I stood alongside men and women who had served in World War II, Korea, Vietnam, the Gulf, and Iraq to announce our office's plan to help local veterans have the personal stories of their service archived for perpetuity in the Library of Congress.

[R-MN3]","Congressman Erik Paulsen, Minnesota's 3rd District Dear Friend, [image = [image = Erik Paulsen Member of Congress  Remembering our Fallen Heroes The United States would not be the country it is today without the brave men and women who have fought to defend our freedoms. Memorial Day is a time fore us to reflect and remember the courage and sacrifice of our soliders whose service tragically cost them their lives. I spent the day in Edina for the dedication of a new veterans memorial that honors the 32 soldiers from the city that were killed in the line of duty. The new memorial will assure that their sacrifice will not be forgotten.  Treat and Reduce Obesity Nearly 20% of the increase in U.S. health care spending over the last two decades has been caused by obesity -- at a cost to Medicare of more than $50 billion a year. In order to combat rising health care costs, addressing obesity has to be part of the equation. That's why I've introduced bipartisan legislation, the Treat and Reduce Obesity Act, to expand treatment options for Medicare beneficiaries afflicted with this disease. The bill removes the exclusion under Medicare Part D for covering drugs that treat and reduce the disease and allows additional qualified health care practitioners to provide intensive behavioral therapy services. We cant fix this problem overnight, but taking bipartisan action now will help us solve our obesity crisis over the long-term.  Growing Investment and Innovation For a number of businesses, including over 400 medical device companies here in Minnesota, research and development is their lifeblood. Many of these companies offer well-paying, high-tech jobs. Because of this, Congress passed the R&D tax credit back in 1981 to encourage businesses to expand their investments, increase innovation, and create jobs. However, businesses often have difficulty with tax planning because the credit has been extended on a short-term basis 16 different times. The United States is the only country in the world that allows important provisions of its tax code to expire. In order to give job creators more certainty -- and to create more permancy in the tax code -- the House took action and passed a permanent extension of the R&D tax credit last week. I spoke on the House floor in favor of its passage. ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- Contact Information: Website: Washington, DC Office 127 Cannon HOB Washington, D.C. 20515 Phone: (202) 225-2871 Fax: (202) 225-6351 District Office 250 Prairie Center Drive, Suite 230 Eden Prairie, MN 55344 Phone: (952) 405-8510 Fax: (952) 405-8514 Privacy Policy: Unsubscribe: ",2015-01-06,3,Rep.,Representative,true,MN,erik.paulsen@congressnewsletter.net,05/31/2015,Republican,3833,,http://paulsen.house.gov,Representative for Minnesota's 3rd congressional district,Erik,RepErikPaulsen,,Paulsen,P000594,202-225-2871,1965-05-14,https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/erik_paulsen/412303,reperikpaulsen,,representative,1030000,Representative,2017-01-03,Rep.

This bipartisan bill, also led by Senators John Thune and Sherrod Brown, simplifies state income tax requirements for employees who work multiple days per year outside the state of their residence. Under the newly proposed requirements, an employee would only be subject to another states taxes if he or she works there more than 30 days per calendar year. The fact is that our current state income tax requirements are holding businesses back. Not only would this new legislation reduce the amount of paperwork involved for individuals, but it would also bring down costs for businesses and treat residents of states without income taxes more fairly. It already has 272 supporters throughout the business community and a growing list of congressional co-sponsors, so I look forward to pushing ahead in an effort to help streamline this portion of our tax code. Stay tuned for updates on the Mobile Workforce State Income Tax Simplification Act of 2015 in the coming weeks. Big government in local waters? Earlier this week, the EPA announced its final Waters of the United States rule. This is simply another gross overreach of the Obama administrations authority. Allowing an outside, federal entity like the EPA to have its hands in local tributaries and waterways  including the Great Lakes  would stifle the local and state governments that understand them best. Thats why the House already passed a bill, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act of 2015, to block this impending rule. We cannot stand by as our business, agriculture and hometown communities are threatened by more big government. As a firm supporter of our Great Lakes, I will work with my colleagues on addressing this unnecessary burden. Obamas immigration plan remains on hold The U.S. Court of Appeals for the 5th Circuit this week rejected the request to lift the stay on President Obama's executive overreach on immigration. While America is known as a land of immigrants, there must be a lawful process for obtaining citizenship  and our president simply cannot overrule the legislative branch in achieving his own agenda for these final 20 months in office. Rest assured, I will continue to hear your concerns and fight for our Constitution. IRS breach In case you missed it, the IRS recently announced that the personal information of 104,000 U.S. taxpayers was obtained by hackers between February and mid-May of this year. The hack went through a third-party website called Get Transcript, which hosts users past tax returns and personal information for the IRS. Hackers attempted to authenticate nearly 200,000 accounts and succeeded with about half of those, gaining access to sensitive tax returns and Social Security Numbers. While the IRS has temporarily shut down Get Transcript, those who had their information accessed will be notified in the coming days and signed up for free credit monitoring services in an effort to monitor any fraudulent activity.

Pascrell Subscribe   About Bill  Media Center  Bill's Views  Services  Student Center  May 2015 Dear Friend, As your representative in Congress for New Jersey's Ninth Congressional District, it is my priority to make sure you stay informed about my work in Washington and in New Jersey. Bergen County Veterans Appreciation Brunch It must be a national priority to recognize and reward the service of our military heroes, which is why I was proud to join Bergen County veterans earlier this month at the American Legion Post 170 to thank them for their service and sacrifices for our country. As a veteran myself, I believe we must keep our promises to our men and women in uniform. Just as the military pledges to leave no solider behind on the battlefield, we will leave no veteran behind when they come home. During this event I discussed the disturbing allegations that unfortunately in many cases proved to be true about our veterans' ability to access health care services at the Veterans Administration (VA). As a result, I worked with my colleagues in a bipartisan effort to assess the situation here in New Jersey and to pass comprehensive legislation to reform the VA. This law's implementation in the coming years will be crucial to the improvement of the VA and I will monitor it closely.  Rep. Pascrell addresses Bergen County veterans at their Appreciation Brunch at American Legion Post 170 There has been a long history leading to the benefits many veterans have today and I believe we need to protect these benefits, not undermine them. That is why I helped to open the first ever veterans' outpatient clinic in Passaic County on the grounds of St. Joseph's Hospital in Paterson, which opened in August 2004 and currently serves almost 1,600 patients. Finally, as we recognize Memorial Day, we remember all those who made the ultimate sacrifice to defend our country. Know that while I am in Congress I will continue my commitment to making sure that every veteran and their families get the health care and other benefits that they have earned and deserve. James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Reauthorization Act Earlier this month I was joined by local first responders from northern New Jersey to urge passage of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Reauthorization Act, legislation that would permanently reauthorize the World Trade Center Health Program, which provides medical monitoring and treatment for first responders at the World Trade Center and sites in New York City, Pentagon, and Shanksville, PA. The bill also extends the September 11thVictim Compensation Fund to provide economic compensation for losses related to 9/11.  Rep. Pascrell stand with local first responders, including the family of James Zadroga, at James Zadroga Memorial Field in North Arlington in support of the 9/11 health bill reauthorization named in Det. Zadroga's honor. The legislation is named in honor of James Zadroga, a North Arlington resident and New York City Police Department officer who died of a respiratory disease that has been attributed to his participation in rescue and recovery operations following the September 11thattacks. Detective Zadroda's selfless sacrifice represents the best our nation has to offer, so it's fitting this legislation is named in his honor. Tragically, many of the 9/11 heroes and survivors still suffer the effects of the airborne toxins at Ground Zero, and under no circumstance should they be stuck with the bill for their medical costs. I will continue to fight for the passage of the James Zadroga 9/11 Health and Compensation Reauthorization Act in order to do right by these heroes and continue the progress we have made since the law's initial passage in 2010. It is our obligation to care for the innocent victims that worked on our nation's behalf for the days, weeks and months after we were attacked. National Police Week In 1962, President John F. Kennedy signed a proclamation that designated May 15thas Peace Officers Memorial Day and the week in which that date falls as Police Week. During Police Week tens of thousands of law enforcement officers from around the world come to Washington, DC to participate in a number of events that honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. In coordination with Police Week, the Law Enforcement Caucus, which I co-chair, hosted a briefing for Members of Congress and staff on less lethal weapons used by police. The Caucus was joined by Inspector Raymond Caroli and Captain Eugene McCarthy from the New York Police Department and Sgt. Kevin Keller from Spokane, Washington Police Department to discuss their real-world experience using various less lethal force technologies. Additionally, the Caucus heard from Alternative Ballistics and Guardian 8, two firms which produce less lethal force technologies as alternatives to traditional firearms. During this Police Week, I was honored to receive an award from the National Association of Police Organizations (NAPO) for my support for our nation's law enforcement officials. Throughout my career I have always believed that to effectively fight crime you need to concentrate on the hotspots of criminal activity and put together specialized units within the police force that work solely on breaking the grip of gangs and drugs. But none of this is possible if you don't have enough officers, which is why I've made it my priority to strengthen Community Oriented Policing Services (COPS) Hiring Program funding. Last year I was proud to stand with Congressman Dave Reichert (R-WA) restore $110 million in cuts to the COPS Hiring Program.  Rep. Pascrell speaks with members of the families of NYPD Officers Ramos and Liu outside the Oval Office prior to the Blue Alert bill signing ceremony. Finally, this week the House passed three pieces of legislation I authored aimed at improving and strengthening our law enforcement. The Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu National Blue Alert Act would create a nationwide alert system to allow for proper coordination across multiple states when a criminal has seriously injured, killed, captured, or made an imminent and credible threat towards a police officer. This legislation also passed the Senate and was signed into law by the President. Just as we have a responsibility to take care of our law enforcement officials, we also have a responsibility to take care of the families of officers who lost their lives in the line of duty. That is why I was glad to see the House pass the Don't Tax Our Fallen Public Safety Heroes Act. This bill would ensure that the families of fallen public safety officers are not taxed on the death benefits they receive should a horrible tragedy occur and their family member be taken from them on the job. Finally, the House passed the Defending Public Safety Employees' Retirement Act, which prevents Federal law enforcement officials from being penalized for drawing on their retirement benefits after a physically taxing career protecting our communities. 19th Annual Congressional Art Competition I would like to congratulate all the students from across New Jersey's 9th Congressional District who participated in the 19thannual Congressional Art Competition, including Hyobin Park from Englewood Cliffs whose piece won Best in Show!

These newsletters will cover a variety of topics, including events happening in Indiana, legislation being considered in Congress, and my perspective on current issues. My hope is to keep you updated and informed on how issues in Washington may impact Hoosiers. I welcome your feedback. Thanks for reading, Dan Coats _____ Trade Bill Passes Senate The Business Roundtable recently found that trade supports 796,619 jobs in Indiana. Companies around our state exported over $34 billion in goods and services in 2013 alone, including $28 billion in manufacturing exports. Indiana also is a national leader in pharmaceutical exports, and Hoosier farmers export about $5 billion in agricultural products every year. Given the importance of trade to Indiana's economy, last week I supported legislation - which passed the Senate - that gives the executive branch the authority to negotiate new trade agreements on behalf of the United States. Currently, our country is negotiating two trade agreements: the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership. The Senate-passed bill defines American negotiating goals while retaining the authority to approve any potential trade agreements. Increasing international trade will strengthen Indiana's economy, create more good-paying jobs, give Hoosier businesses access to new markets and enhance our national security. Free and fair trade will help Hoosier farms and families by opening emerging foreign markets to Hoosier agricultural and manufacturing products. _____ Abuse of Education Tax Credits  As I have noted in previous Waste of the Week speeches, our federal tax code is a mess. I recently highlighted one aspect of the tax code that must be cleaned up: education tax credits. Currently, there are a dizzying array of tax benefits for higher education, all of which come with their own rules. This complexity makes it so that even well-meaning taxpayers make mistakes when they claim these benefits. According to the Treasury Inspector General for Tax Administration, the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) paid out billions in potentially erroneous education tax credits to more than 3.6 million taxpayers. To help curtail these erroneous payments, I introduced legislation that would require taxpayers to have a valid form of proof in their possession when they fill out their tax returns and claim tuition benefits. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated that this simple change to require some proof that tuition was actually paid would save $576 million over the next 10 years. My legislation aims to improve tax compliance in this area by simply requiring proof of eligibility. Additionally, my legislation provides relief from penalties for higher education institutions if they certify that they have complied with IRS standards by requesting required student information that the students failed to provide. This requirement will allow Hoosier taxpayers, students and institutions to enjoy these tax benefits for years to come, as well as root out fraud and abuse by those who seek to game the system.

During my time in Congress, Ive fought for a more transparent government that respects the rights of all Americans. Part of that fight has been to reform the PATRIOT Act, a law notorious for providing the federal government with sweeping powers that infringe on our privacy. The PATRIOT Act has again been in the news because without Congressional action before the end of the month, key provisions of the law will expire. While these issues are front and center today, Ive pushed back since the beginning. I voted against the first PATRIOT Act in 2001 and have voted against every reauthorization since  including this years bill  because I refuse to compromise when it comes to protecting your privacy. While there are meaningful changes to the PATRIOT Act in this years reauthorization (known as the USA FREEDOM Act), they fall short of the full and complete reform you deserve. Revisions around the margins to an egregious provision that has led to bulk data collection and a violation of millions of Americans privacy is not good enough. Real reform looks like the Surveillance State Repeal Act, which Im a proud cosponsor of and would repeal the PATRIOT and 2008 FISA Amendments Acts while extending whistleblower protections to certain intelligence agencies. Last week, I urged my Senate colleagues to improve the flawed House bill. In a rush to beat the June 1 deadline and to appease Senate Majority Leader McConnell, however, it appears the Senate will pass a version thats even worse. This is an instance where wed all be better off with Congressional inaction, allowing the program to expire. We need a more accountable approach that balances individual privacy with our national defense. U.S. intelligence gathering systems should be reformed to ensure they are effective, efficient and secure, while simultaneously protecting the rights of the American people. Both efforts are critical and are by no means mutually exclusive, which is why I will continue to oppose any reform of the PATRIOT Act that does not strike that balance. This fight is a snapshot of a broader issue. We currently spend close to $80 billion a year on intelligence gathering in the United States  an exact figure is classified, an unnecessary secret Ive tried to change. In 2012, the last year that this data was reported, 4.92 million federal employees and contractors had access to secret information. I'm concerned that the amount of information being reviewed by the intelligence community and number of people involved may actually be making us less safe, not more. I will continue to fight to reform these bloated intelligence programs.

As a National Guardsman, this day holds a special significance for me. I was fortunate to be home in Hawaii to mark this day of remembrance and to be able to recognize this important occasion. Over the weekend, I participated in a multitude of events that paid tribute to Hawaiis fallen heroes. On Sunday, I spoke at the Roll Call of Honor in Remembrance Ceremony held at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. This ceremony also marked the 80th Anniversary of the First Expedition of the Hui Panalaau Colonists. Their legacy lives on in the peace that was restored to the Pacific and the lives that were saved because of their courage and sacrifice. It was my privilege to introduce House Resolution 169 that recognizes and honors the Hui Panalaau Colonists. These men embody the enduring spirit of our home, and their steadfast dedication is a testament to their fortitude and courage. Following the Roll Call Ceremony, the Aloha Council of the Boy Scouts of America hosted an event to commemorate our fallen soldiers. Over 2,500 Cub Scouts and Boy Scouts from different troops across Oahu came together to pay their respects by placing lei and flags on the final resting places of our servicemembers. During the Veterans Memorial Day Candlelight Ceremony, an annual event held at sunset to honor the lives lost during the Vietnam War, I was able to reflect upon the soldiers that went missing in action and were unable to return home. On Monday was the 66th Mayors Memorial Day Ceremony held at the National Memorial Cemetery of the Pacific. Following the ceremony, I went to the Hawaii State Veterans Cemetery for the Governors Memorial Day Ceremony. The contributions of our fallen soldiers has affected every community across our nation and is particularly felt in Hawaii, where we have a long legacy of service above self. My weekend concluded by attending the iconic Lantern Floating Hawaii ceremony. The ceremony provides a beautiful reminder to honor and respect those who have come before us. Memorial Day Weekend is an important reminder of the high cost that is paid during times of conflict. However, it is vital to always have gratitude for the tremendous bravery and devotion of Americas soldiers, whose service has enabled us to preserve the freedoms and civil liberties our country was founded upon. It is up to all of us to ensure that their sacrifices will never be forgotten and that we continue to build upon the legacy they left behind.

[R-VA4]"," Send me an email | Forward to a Friend Stories from Virginias Small Businesses Owners By Congressman Randy Forbes May 28, 2015 From the shoemakers of Jamestown to the soda shops of mid-century main street to the tech start ups and online clothing boutiques of todays e-commerce community, American small businesses have been the backbone of our nations economy for centuries. Today, more than half of Americans either own or work for a small business. Since the early 1990s, small businesses have created about two out of every three new jobs in the U.S. annually. In whatever form they take  whether brick-and-mortar or online, decades old or start up  small businesses represent what is best about our nation. Earlier this month we recognized National Small Business Week to acknowledge the critical contributions of Americas entrepreneurs and small business owners. During that week, I asked constituents from Virginias Fourth District to share what they love about some of the small businesses in the Fourth District. Many people contributed to the conversation. And notably, the comments werent just about the products or services these small businesses offer. Rather, most people recognized the valuable role these business owners play in strengthening our communities. They reminded us of values we can take from their business stories  reminders that small businesses fuel our nation in more ways than economics. This week I share with you the faces and stories of just a few of Virginias small business owners and the inspiring lessons we can learn from their hard work and dedication. Dream big, start small. Tom Skordas immigrated to the United States from Greece in the 1960s in search of the American Dream. After numerous business ventures in the restaurant and hospitality sector, Tom opened Prince George Family BBQ in Prince George County.

For the last five years our state has experienced a drought so severe it has reduced water levels to historic lows and brought conservation efforts to all time highs. Lakes and reservoirs have been nearly bone dry. Wildfires have been a constant threat. Just when we thought it couldn't get any worse, we were delivered what we so desperately needed but far too much in too short of time. In a 180 degree turn of events, flood waters have impacted thousands of Texans. The last few days have been marked by death, destruction and disbelief.  I've met with first responders in Hays County, toured flood damage and spoke to the National Guard and regional FEMA officers about response and recovery operations in the affected areas. While we are currently in a period of shock and mourning, I am certain the strong Texas spirit of resolve, which I reference so often, will prove more powerful than Mother Nature's fury. We are going to take care of each other, look out for our neighbors and together, push forward. As soon as state officials conclude their damage assessments, I will stand behind their efforts and work with them to ensure a full recovery of these communities.

senior,"113,114,115",Male,N00009926,300078,"Nelson, Bill (Sen.) [D-FL]","Dear Friends, You may have read recently that the oil industry is once again looking to drill off Floridas Gulf Coast. In fact, earlier this month a group of senators from Louisiana, Texas and Mississippi filed legislation to lift the current drilling ban and allow oil rigs to move as close as 50 miles off Florida. We all saw what happened when the Deepwater Horizon rig exploded just 49 miles off Louisianas coast five years ago. At some point, folks need to ignore Big Oil's greed and simply do whats right. In response to this latest threat, I filed legislation last week to not only keep the current drilling ban I passed in 2006, but to extend it for another five years  from 2022 until 2027. Please take a minute to see what the Sarasota Herald-Tribune editorial board had to say about the issue: Editorial: Keep oil off our coast By Editorial Board Published: May 27, 2015 As an Associated Press article in Tuesday's Herald-Tribune reported, tourism on the northern Gulf Coast is beginning to recover -- five years after the BP oil spill. It makes you wonder: How would Florida cope with a five-year drought in tourism? And the answer is: It would be a disaster, in and of itself. Tourism is a $70 billion industry in Florida. More than a million Floridians -- one of every 9 workers -- have jobs tied to the tourism industry, according to the state Department of Economic Opportunity. The threat of a major oil spill to this state should concern all Florida residents and their elected officials, because some U.S. senators are ready to take that risk. Sen. Bill Cassidy, R-La., has introduced a bill that would repeal a federal moratorium on oil drilling within 125 miles of Florida's Gulf Coast; the no-drilling zone extends out 235 miles at some points. Cassidy's bill would allow oil rigs just 50 miles off Florida's coast. Several Republican senators from Gulf Coast states -- Louisiana's other senator, David Vitter, two senators from Mississippi and one from Texas -- co-filed the bill. 'Florida is under siege' Cassidy said drilling closer to Florida could produce an estimated million barrels of oil per day, provide jobs and boost the region's economy. Unless, of course, there's yet another oil disaster -- one just 50 miles from Florida's west coast. The Deepwater Horizon rig that exploded in 2010, causing the BP spill, was 49 miles off Louisiana's coast. Florida Sen. Bill Nelson, a Democrat, is outraged -- as he should be. He wrote the 2006 legislation that established the no-drilling zone, which is to remain in place until 2022. ""Florida is under siege,"" Nelson said last week. ""At some point, folks need to ignore Big Oil's greed and simply do what's right."" Besides threatening Florida's tourism industry, Nelson said, oil drilling poses a serious risk to Florida's delicate environment and to U.S. military training areas in the eastern Gulf. In response to Cassidy's bill, Nelson filed legislation last week that would extend the current moratorium for five years, to 2027. We hope Florida's Republican senator, Marco Rubio, joins with Nelson to condemn Cassidy's bill and back the moratorium's extension. As a presidential candidate, Rubio could demonstrate leadership within the Senate's Republican majority. Not a partisan issue Gov. Rick Scott should also support Nelson's stand, as should Republican leaders in the Florida Legislature. As Scott said recently of the state's tourism: ""There's jobs all over the state because people are coming here or tourists are buying homes and moving their business here."" Scott, a Republican, should tell that to Cassidy and his GOP colleagues. Protecting Florida from the risks inherent in oil drilling has never been a partisan issue in this state. Nelson's 2006 bill was co-sponsored by Mel Martinez, Florida's Republican senator at the time. As governor, Jeb Bush also opposed oil rigs off the Florida coast. If Cassidy and his Senate backers want to risk another oil disaster off their coasts, that's their business -- but not if Florida's economy and environment are placed in further jeopardy. Florida's business depends on tourism and the environment, and those resources should not be put up for sale to the oil industry at any price. It took five years for tourism in Louisiana, Mississippi and Alabama to begin to recover from the Deepwater Horizon spill. If a similar disaster occurred 50 miles off Florida's Gulf Coast, how long would it take this state to recover? Floridians should not have to find out.

View online version Holding Big Oil Accountable Thursday, May 28, 2015 Dear Lindsey, Like many Central Coast residents, I vividly remember the 1969 Santa Barbara oil spill and its devastating impacts on our environment and economy. When I visited Refugio State Beach last week to see the devastation from the oil spill, I couldn't help but recall the similarities between the two events. The 1969 oil spill is always fresh in my mind, which is why I have spent my entire Congressional career working to limit and reduce the amount of oil drilling that takes place on the Central Coast. Last week's oil spill is yet another tragic reminder of the serious risks oil drilling poses to our economy and environment. We know drilling is dangerous, dirty, and messy. And no matter what, spills happen. The only way to truly prevent future spills is to move away from fossil fuels and toward clean, renewable sources of energy. My staff and I have been working closely with local, state, and federal agencies as they respond to the spill and coordinate the cleanup. I can assure you that I will also continue working to not only ensure this incident is thoroughly investigated and those responsible are held accountable, but that regulations are as strong as possible moving forward.

[R-NE]","U.S. Senator Deb Fischer's Monthly Record Dear Friends, Citizens across Nebraska and our nation were shocked last week by the loss of Omaha Police Officer Kerrie Orozco, who was killed in the line of duty. This is a terrible tragedy, and words cannot express my deep sadness. Officer Orozco was a mother, an excellent police officer, and a role model to us all. I join all Nebraskans in offering love and support to her family during this difficult time. Also this month, we mourned the death of Captain Dustin Lukasiewicz of Wilcox  the Marine Corps helicopter pilot who gave his life while searching for the victims of the massive Nepal earthquake. By forging into danger to rescue strangers in a distant land, Captain Lukasiewicz represented the ideals of our nation and personified Americas mission as a force for good in the world. My thoughts and prayers are with his loved ones as they cope with this tragic loss. His service to our nation will be remembered by the heroic mission he served. As we observed Memorial Day this past weekend, we were reminded of those who made the ultimate sacrifice. Officer Orozco and Captain Lukasiewicz represent the very best of Nebraska and our nation. We must continue to honor their lives by showing our gratitude and remembering the cost of our freedom. Please read on for the latest news and updates from my office this month.

[image = [link 2] [image = [link 3] [image = [link 4] [image = [link 5] *Build USA Act* * [image = [link 6] This month, I was proud to introduce a new transportation bill known as the *Build USA Act* [link 7]. Core infrastructure projects have been at a standstill across the country due to excessive regulations and a lack of transportation funding. Meanwhile, millions of Americans sit in endless traffic jams on decaying roads as construction projects remain stalled. To get America moving, the Build USA Act would create the American Infrastructure Bank (AIB) and offer states new financing and funding tools to generate transportation projects. The bill is modeled off a plan I championed in Nebraska that has led to successful projects in Buffalo County, South Sioux City, Scottsbluff, and Adams County. *Click here* [link 8] to watch my floor speech on the bill where I highlighted these Nebraska success stories. For more information on the Build USA Act, *read* [link 9] my op-ed in the *Omaha World-Herald*. *FIGHTING FOR YOU ON THE ISSUES THAT MATTER* *Strengthening Free Trade* Our nation has an enormous opportunity to open new markets, increase productivity, and create jobs through strong free-trade agreements.This month, the Senate passed bipartisan Trade Promotion Authority legislation, ensuring that the United States will have a strong voice at the negotiating table. It also allows the unsung heroes of the American dinner table  including Nebraskas farmers, ranchers, food processors, and their families  to offer their products to the world. *Click here* [link 10] to read more. *Generating New Opportunities for Struggling Americans* Earlier this month, I was proud to introduce legislation that would improve the Small Business Administrations microloan program. *The Microloan Act of 2015* [link 11] helps Americas entrepreneurs with limited resources by increasing flexibility and creating more opportunities for them to start their own businesses. Without access to capital, too many struggling Americans are unable to build and grow successful small businesses.* *This common-sense bill will provide ambitious creators with the tools they need to start their own businesses, escape poverty, create jobs, and strengthen our families and communities. *Stopping the EPAs Electric Takeover* Also this month, I helped introduce new legislation that will halt the damaging effects of the Obama administrations proposed regulations on new and existing power plants. As a 100 percent public power state, Nebraska will be disproportionately impacted. Families and businesses will be forced to pay for costly plant upgrades, higher electricity bills, and more expensive goods and services.** **To stop this, I cosponsored the *Affordable Reliable Energy Now Act* [link 12]* *(ARENA). This bill would protect states from the EPAs proposed takeover of our electric grid. This overreach is unnecessary and with this bill, we can empower states across the country to protect their citizens without harming our economy. *Fischer Legislation Approved by Commerce Committee* Two of my bills passed through markup in the Senate Commerce Committee this month, including the *E-Warranty Act* [link 13] and the Maritime Administration Enhancement Act. These bills show that bipartisan solutions are possible. Senator Bill Nelson of Florida and I worked together to present the E-Warranty Act, which would provide manufacturers with the option of meeting their warranty notice requirements by posting this information online. The world is changing, and our technology is getting smaller, faster, and more efficient. Our laws must follow suit. The other bill provides important resources for our Maritime Administration (MARAD). I was pleased to work with Senator Cory Booker of New Jersey to reach an agreement and ensure that MARADs programs to strengthen national security and enhance our nations maritime transportation system will be authorized.

The bill would also offer states more authority over their own compliance with federal infrastructure requirements. *GOP vows to fight against Obamas power grab water rule [link 18]* *The Hill* The Obama administrations new regulation implies that Washington bureaucrats know better than the people of our state, Sen. Deb Fischer (R-Neb.) said in a statement. This rule is reckless and unwarranted, and I will work tirelessly to stop this expansion of federal control, she said. *Sen. Deb Fischer lays out sweeping plan to revamp nation's road funding [link 19]* *Omaha World-Herald* Sen.

Deb Fischer on Tuesday introduced legislation designed to offer states new financing and funding tools to generate highway construction. *The Debs [link 21]* *Column  Omaha World-Herald* For the past three years, a YMCA boys basketball team in Omaha has called itself The Debs. They are certainly not debutantes. The teams official name is Team Deb Fischer, in honor of the U.S. senator from Nebraska. *Federal Highway Trust Fund runs low as states enter height of construction season [link 22]* *Omaha World-Herald* Sen. Deb Fischer, R-Neb., is chairwoman of the subcommittee with jurisdiction over surface transportation. She held a hearing last week on the trust fund. After the hearing she noted the urgency and called for swift action on the short-term extension while working on the bigger picture. *Editorial, 5/15: A vote for better roads [link 23]* *Lincoln Journal Star* The highway trust fund has repeatedly gone broke. Every so often, Congress gets its act together and injects another infusion of funds -- but only when the situation reaches crisis level. The Legislature recognized in 2011, when it passed the Build Nebraska Act sponsored by then-state Sen. Deb Fischer, to designate one-quarter cent of the state sales tax for roads. *Fischer, Smith applauded for support of E15 legislation [link 24]* *The Grand Island Independent* Sen.

,114,Male,N00009759,43336,"Larsen, Rick (Rep.) [D-WA2]","Dear Neighbors: I recently met with students across Northwest Washington who are gaining valuable skills in science, technology, engineering and mathematics, commonly known as STEM. At Burlington-Edison High School, students showed me a robot they built that can move and stack items. Middle school students in Arlington are learning about aerodynamics and population growth estimations. And I have heard from high school students from South Whidbey Island who recently competed regionally and internationally on a project involving submarines. These skills will help our students succeed in a globally competitive workforce. I am working to expand access to STEM education opportunities for our students, because investing in the next generation of workers means a stronger economy for us all. Let me share some of my efforts on this issue. Earlier this month, I introduced the Youth Access to American Jobs Act of 2015 (H.R. 2224), a bill that connects students to training in STEM skills to prepare them for good-paying jobs in manufacturing. The bill creates a pathway that engages students in STEM-related fields from their junior year in high school through community college and into an apprenticeship. By pairing education with apprenticeships, we can build a clear, affordable bridge between students and good-paying manufacturing jobs. I am also working to make sure that as we expand STEM education, everyone has access. I am supporting two other bills that improve access to STEM for women and minorities.  The Stepping up to STEM Education Act seeks to engage all students, particularly minority students, with STEM through public-private partnerships and networks that expand access to STEM opportunities.  The STEM Opportunities Act of 2015 aims to improve data collection, analysis, and best practices to increase opportunities for and improve retention of women and minorities in STEM-related fields. Innovations and skills our students learn through STEM education will help them succeed in the workforce and keep our regions economy competitive and strong.

[D-WA9]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email  News from Representative Adam Smith  We must conserve our natural resources for future generations. Protecting our environment is a priority of mine - and I support legislative efforts that work towards that end. I am a proud co-sponsor of H.R. 1814, which would permanently reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF). For over 50 years, the LWCF has carried out a simple, bipartisan idea to use revenues from offshore oil and gas, to conserve our land and water and provide recreation opportunities for all Americans. LWCF is the only federal program dedicated to conservation and the promotion of access for hunting, fishing, and other types of recreation. This legislation works to ensure that critical park protection and recreational development opportunities throughout the nation are not lost forever. Earlier this month, Washington State took a great step forward in protecting our environment by joining states and provinces worldwide in committing to cut greenhouse gas emissions 80-95 percent below 1990 levels by 2050. The ""Under 2 MOU,"" agreement is named to refer to the participating jurisdictions' commitments to reduce emissions to limit global warming to less than 2C by the end of this century. As a founding signatory to the agreement crafted at the Paris Climate Conference, Washington State will serve as a leader in reaching out to other jurisdictions around the world to spur action toward meaningful accomplishments at the United Nations Climate Change Conference (COP21) taking place in Paris in December 2015. Here at home, we are very aware that Puget Sound struggles with the effects of pollution. Every year, millions of pounds of pollutants enter Puget Sound through rainwater runoff. Rainwater flows over hard surfaces, like parking lots, driveways and streets, and picks up pollution along the way. This polluted water flows through ditches or storm drains and into local waterways. As individuals, we contribute a significant portion of the pollution though actions that can be changed to protect our environment. About Puget Sound Starts Here Puget Sound Starts Here is a campaign supported by a consortium of more than 750 organizations across Puget Sound's 12 counties, including state agencies, local governments, tribes, and non-governmental organizations working to clean up and protect Puget Sound and our region's local waterways. The goal of Puget Sound Starts Here is to raise awareness that Puget Sound is in trouble due to a variety of pollution sources, and empower residents to make a difference through simple actions and local volunteer opportunities. Simple actions you can take: * Volunteer to help with local organizations working to restore habitat. * Take your car to a commercial car wash rather than washing it in your driveway. * Fix auto leaks right away and take any used fluids to a recycling center. * Pick up pet waste and place it in the trash. * Maintain your septic system. * Use less hazardous cleaning solutions. * Never dump anything into a storm drain or drainage ditch. * Use natural yard products like compost and mulch. * Store and dispose of household chemicals according to the instructions on the label. * Landscape your yard with native plants and trees that soak up rain and slow the flow of runoff. Learn more about the Puget Sound and how you can help protect it at . About the Puget Sound Partnership The Puget Sound Partnership is the state agency formed to lead the region's collective effort to restore and protect Puget Sound. Working with more than 750 governments, tribes, scientists, businesses, and nonprofits, the Partnership coordinates and catalyzes partner action around a common agenda, mobilizes Sound investments, and tracks progress to optimize recovery.

,114,Male,N00030676,43554,"Long, Billy (Rep.) [R-MO7]","Congressman Billy Long ====================================== Since 2009, stores have been required to include country of origin labeling (COOL) on unprepared or raw foods, such as fresh fruits and vegetables, a variety of nuts, and ground or cuts of beef, chicken, pork and lamb. The rules, based on the 2002 Farm Bill, have been the source of controversy among some livestock producers and actions against the U.S. within the World Trade Organization (WTO) from Canada and Mexico. The WTO ruled May 18 against the U.S. and determined that U.S. COOL regulation harms trade obligations with Canada and Mexico. The ruling comes after four years of back-and-forth within the WTO and several USDA revisions to COOL. The WTOs ruling will allow Canada and Mexico to impose retaliatory tariffs on products such as meat and crops. This could cost U.S. agriculture billions and could have a $623 million impact on Missouris agriculture economy [link 1]  especially on beef, pork, corn and soybean producers. Canada has already made threats, stating in 2013 that it would impose a 100-percent tax on imported U.S. commodities [link 2]. This could have a large, negative impact on southwest Missouri, and that is why I am one of the original co-sponsors of H.R. 2393 [link 3], which would repeal COOL. A simple repeal would shelter farmers and businesses from undue burdens Canadian and Mexican sanctions could bring. These retaliatory tariffs could deal a blow to the Missouri Seventh Districts [link 4] $265 million cattle industry and $58 million grains industry. I am a firm believer in free trade with other nations forged through agreements and mutual understanding. If it were not for trade between Canada and Mexico in the first place, Missouri- and American-made goods would have a much smaller market. After all, Canada and Mexico are the top two destinations for Missouri-made merchandise, making up 50 percent [link 5] of Missouri exports value.

Issues  Press  Schedule a Meeting  facebook  you tube  tweeter   May 27, 2015 Dear Cormack, Over the Memorial Day weekend, we paused to remember and honor the selfless men and women who have given their lives in defense of the freedom we enjoy as Americans. Across eastern Connecticut, communities held parades, ceremonies and other events to collectively honor those who have made the ultimate sacrifice. Over the weekend, I was privileged to participate in events  in Enfield, Windham, Suffield, and Vernon to pay tribute to those American heroes on this solemn holiday. Recently, I was honored to present the Purple Heart  to the family of a soldier killed in battle in France during World War I. Despite having immigrated to the U.S. only four years earlier, Private Patrick O'Brien gave his life for his adopted nation. The dedication displayed in Private O'Brien's actions epitomizes the duty and devotion of America's sons and daughters who have lost their lives in our nation's service.  Congressman Courtney awards the Purple Heart and World War I Victory Medal to Mary Knapp, niece of Private Patrick O'Brien and a veteran herself who served in the U.S. Air Force during the Korean War. Eastern Connecticut's military and veteran communities are an integral part of the fabric of our region - our district is home to more veterans than any other in the state, totaling eight percent of the population of the Second District. Many of our region's veterans continue to serve our communities through volunteer work and in public service, and through participation in the many veterans' groups. This year marks the 50th anniversary of the beginning of the Vietnam War-a period in our history characterized by inadequate support for the veterans who returned home from battle. In eastern Connecticut, Vietnam veterans have worked hard to advocate for improved health care and support services that today's military veterans rely on, and I applaud their continued advocacy and efforts on this front. Memorial Day reminds us to honor those who have given their lives for our freedom by upholding the promise to care for our military veterans and provide the benefits they have earned through their service, and I will keep working to ensure that our promise is kept.

May 29, 2015 IN THIS ISSUE:  Senator Collins Honors Maine's Fallen Heroes  Senate Approves Important Improvements to Rural Veterans' Health Care  Senator Collins Welcomes U.S. Secretary of Labor to Maine to Highlight Workforce Training Programs  Senator Collins Speaks to Students At Brewer High School WEEKLY COLUMN ""Building a Strong Workforce"" By: Senator Susan M. Collins If you could get a return of $27 for every one dollar that you invested in a company, you would jump at the chance. According to United States Department of Labor Secretary Thomas Perez, that is exactly the return we get for every federal dollar that is spent on apprenticeship training programs. As the Secretary points out, apprenticeships are a tried and true approach for passing the practical training needed to succeed in a job on to the next generation. An apprenticeship is just as applicable to the complex skills needed to compete in the 21st century workforce as it was in the 18th century when this country was founded. I invited Secretary Perez to come to Maine last week so he could see apprenticeship programs in action at Bath Iron Works and the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard. These two important Maine employers have instituted apprenticeship programs to attract and train highly skilled workers that will help keep their operations competitive for years to come. It is fitting that these two facilities, so important to our nations security and our states economic future, are on the cutting-edge of workforce development. Secretary Perez has devoted his career to supporting, protecting, and developing a strong American workforce. His obvious enthusiasm for improving opportunities for our workers is infectious, and he has a very clear vision about how job training can lead to a stable and secure middle-class lifestyle. Secretary Perez and I began the day at BIW, a 131-year-old company that depends on highly skilled workers to produce the most advanced surface combatant ships in the world. As the current workforce ages, the shipyard will have to hire many new workers in the years ahead. The leaders from the company and the trade unions recognized the need to provide additional training in order pass specialized shipbuilding skills on to the next generation of workers. They have collaborated on a training program that will help do just that. This relatively new program, which includes an emerging partnership with Southern Maine Community College, has tremendous potential and could be vital to the future success of the shipyard. We then concluded the day at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard in Kittery, Maine. Over 200 years old, PNSY is one of only four public shipyards in the United States. Known as the Cradle of American Shipbuilding, the skilled workers at PNSY today overhaul and maintain the nuclear submarine fleet of the United States Navy. PNSY has gone from sail to the atom by supporting a rigorous and robust apprentice program, where on-the-job learning, technical trade training, and academics combine to produce the highly skilled workers required by this demanding field. PNSY works closely with York County Community College to offer credits towards associate degrees in trade and technical occupations. During our tour of the shipyards learning centers, Secretary Perez and I had the opportunity to meet PNSY apprentice Jennifer Ouellette, who exemplifies the opportunity effective workforce training programs can provide.

Senator Collins Honors Maine's Fallen Heroes  To watch the video click here  or the play button above On Memorial Day, Senator Collins delivered remarks honoring our nations fallen heroes at the Maine Veterans Cemetery in Augusta. In her speech, the Senator shared one of her earliest childhood memories, her father taking her to the Memorial Day parade in her hometown of Caribou: He would hoist me high upon his shoulders and there, from the best vantage point along the parade route, I would see the hats come off and the hands go over hearts as our Flag went by. Some years, he would wear his old Army jacket. It was not until many years later that I learned the terrible price he had paid for it  the Battle of the Bulge, the Bronze Star, and two Purple Hearts. That quiet courage, that modest heroism, that desire to do nothing more after conflicts end but to return home to a peaceful and productive civilian life is part of the history we celebrate today. It is a history we see from the shoulders of generations of such Americans. To read Senator Collins' full speech click here  .  >From WABI ""Senator Susan Collins Remembers Fallen Veterans with Augusta Community""  ""U.S. Senator Susan Collins made remarks at an Augusta cemetery today in honor of fallen veterans. Senator Collins was joined by several congressmen and First Lady Ann LePage at the Maine Veterans Memorial Cemetery. 'We raise our voices in song and bow our heads in prayer in honor of those who gave their all for each of us. When we do so we are reminded that freedom is a gift purchased at the greatest possible price,' said Senator Susan Collins. ""Collins says it meant a lot to her to share this solemn day of gratitude and grief with the Augusta community. She says it brings back childhood memories of Memorial Day celebrations she attended in Caribou with a very special World War II veteran who happens to be her father.""   Senate Approves Important Improvements to Rural Veterans' Health Care The Access to Community Care for Veterans Act of 2015, legislation co-sponsored by Senator Collins, recently passed the United States Senate by unanimous consent. This legislation would require the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) to expand eligibility of the Choice Program to cover veterans who reside more than 40 miles driving distance from the closest VA facility that offers the specific care they need. The bill must now be considered and passed by the House of Representatives before it can be sent to the President.  In February, Senator Collins led a bipartisan group of 42 Senators in expressing concerns about the implementation of the Choice Program in a letter to Secretary of Veterans Affairs  Robert McDonald. Then in March, Senator Collins met with Secretary McDonald  and discussed many issues important to Maine veterans, including the 40-mile rule as it relates to the Veterans Choice Card Program. One week later, the VA announced that it would make a critical change to the 40-mile rule, rejecting the as the crow flies, or a straight line distance measurement. With the change in calculating the actual distance that the veteran would have to travel, the number of eligible veterans nationwide who can receive care in their communities roughly doubles. While that change was an important first step, the Choice Card rules still did not consider the type of care available within 40 miles of where a veteran lives. The bill passed today by the Senate would direct the VA to make this necessary change.  Senator Collins Welcomes U.S. Secretary of Labor to Maine to Highlight Workforce Training Programs Senator Susan Collins welcomed U.S. Department of Labor Secretary, Thomas E. Perez, to Maine this week to see the success of the innovative workforce training programs located at two anchors of Maines economy: Bath Iron Works and the Portsmouth Naval Ship Yard. Senator Collins greeted Secretary Perez Wednesday Morning at the Portland International Jetport where she thanked him for spending the entire day in Maine and underscored their shared commitmentindeed a passionfor making sure that Maine workers have the education, the skills, and the training that they need for the jobs of today and tomorrow.  Grady Trimble, WCSH ""US Labor Secretary Visits Maine Shipyards""  ""U.S. Labor Secretary Thomas Perez said an aging workforce at shipyards underscores the importance of training a new generation of workers with the skills needed to 'punch their ticket to the middle class.' ""Perez made the remarks Wednesday as he got a firsthand look at an apprentice program at Portsmouth Naval Shipyard and a training center at Bath Iron Works. He said he plans to take good ideas back to Washington.  To watch the video click here  or the play button above ""'What I learned today in Maine is that these investments pay remarkable dividends, and these investments need to continue,' Perez said. ""Sen. Susan Collins, who extended the invitation, joined Perez on visits to Bath and Kittery. ""Collins and Perez pointed to Jenn Ouellette, a welding apprentice at the Portsmouth Naval Shipyard, as an example of the apprentice programs' success. Oullette went to college for three years before deciding to follow in her grandparents footsteps by working at the shipyard. ""The Portsmouth Naval Shipyard's four-year apprentice program earned attention from Vice President Joe Biden, who visited in September. Bath Iron Works, meanwhile, opened its training center for new workers last year.""

Susan Collins. ""Collins was invited to speak to honors students and answer their questions about her position on state standardized testing, gridlock in the government, rising energy costs and more. Collins told the students about her journey from growing up in Caribou to becoming a state Senator. She said she hopes to inspire younger generations to get involved in their government because they are the future of this country. ""'They have an important role to play. If they don't like cynicism and the gridlock they see in Washington, they need to get involved. And their voices will be heard and they can make a difference,' Collins said.

[R-ID1]","Congressman Raul Labrador, Representing the 1st District of Idaho Dear Friends, A year ago, Lancey Robbins visited the U.S. Capitol and marveled at the quality of student art lining the underground tunnels. She imagined her work hanging on the same walls, representing Idahos 1st District in the annual Congressional Art Competition. Robbins will soon see her dream realized. Her work, Oasis in the Owyhees, won this years contest. In June, she and her parents, Jeff and Dawnell, will attend the annual awards ceremony. Its pretty awesome, said Robbins, 16, a sophomore at Another Choice Charter School in Nampa. [image = Robbins is pretty awesome herself. She credits two art teachers for her success, Courtney Linker at Another Choice Charter and Crystal Myers of the Melba School District. Linker, who urged Robbins to enter the Congressional Competition, calls her a model student and hard worker. Myers says shes not afraid to push the limits of her ability. I wish all my students were as courageous in their art as Lancey, Myers said. The painting that will hang for the next year in the Capitol depicts Squaw Creek, near Marsing. Robbins chose the image after a friend showed her photos from a desert hike. It instantly clicked, Robbins said. I told myself, I have to paint that. Amazingly enough, the winning entry was Robbins first work in oil. As a youngster, she used colored pencils and markers, often choosing horses and pets as subjects, including a cocker spaniel named Mayla and a cat named Gismo. She also worked with acrylics, but found them runny. So when Myers offered to loan her oil paints, she jumped at the chance. With oils, you can flick your brush up and get these neat little ridges, Robbins said. With the waterfall I used thick, thick paint and was able to get that beautiful texture where it looks like the water was actually foaming and running. She also loves the way oils combine. They perfectly blend together, running from light to dark. You get those nice, popping colors. Robbins plans to seek an art degree in college and thinks working for Walt Disney Imagineering would be a great job. When she and her folks are in Washington, they plan to visit the Smithsonians National Gallery of Art. Robbins is especially keen on seeing the Van Goghs. The Congressional Art Competition began in 1982 and more than 650,000 high school students have participated. The other 1st District winners this year were 2nd place finisher Sarah Darby of Mountain View High in Meridian; 3rd place Riley Helal of Coeur dAlene High; and Heidi Patin, also of Coeur dAlene High, who was the choice of voters on my Facebook page.

Millers V2I Legislation WASHINGTON U.S. Representative Candice Millers (MI-10) legislative proposal to authorize the use of existing surface transportation funding to invest in vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) technologies that improve highway safety, the Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Safety Technology Investment Flexibility Act of 2015 (H.R. 910), has been endorsed by the Auto Alliance, an automobile manufacturing association of 12 major vehicle manufacturers. In his letter to Rep. Miller  , Auto Alliance President and CEP, Mitch Bainwol, said: As we move into technologies centered on crash avoidance, the goals of safety and fuel efficiency are now perfectly aligned. Technologies that inform the driver and even mitigate driver error not only will save lives, injury and property, but also do much to diminish congestion on our roads. National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) estimates that vehicle-to-vehicle (V2V) and vehicle-to-infrastructure (V2I) communications systems have the potential to mitigate or eliminate up to 80% of non-impaired crashes on all our roadways today. The benefits to society are striking. In creating incentives for deployment of this emerging technology, you are paving the way for a safer and less congested transportation network. Once again, we applaud your efforts and look forward to working with you. The Vehicle-to-Infrastructure Safety Technology Investment Flexibility Act of 2015 (H.R. 910): * For the first time, defines V2I technology in Title 23 to provide a uniform definition for legislative and regulatory purposes; * Clarifies that states may utilize existing surface transportation funding provided by the National Highway Performance Program (NHPP), the Surface Transportation Program (STP), and the Highway Safety Improvement Program (HSIP) to invest in V2I projects that improve road safety. ###   CONNECT WITH US     Washington D.C.

Honoring our Nation's Heroes The National Mall in Washington, D.C., is surrounded by monuments we have built in tribute to our greatest Americans. From Lincoln to Jefferson to Washington, we remember the American leaders who formed our nation and imbued it with the ideals of liberty and justice for all. But perhaps the most reverential memorials along the National Mall are those dedicated to the memory of the everyday American heroes who fought and sometimes lost their lives. The National World War II Memorial, the Korean War Veterans Memorial, and the Vietnam Veterans Memorial represent the sacrifices made by our parents, our grandparents and all the other individuals who served in years past so that we could live freely as we do today. However, many veterans of these past wars have never been given the opportunity to see the memorials honoring their service. The Honor Flight organization attempts to repay a small part of the debt we owe our veterans by paying homage to their sacrifice and patriotism. Honor flights provide veterans a chance to reflect and remember the soldiers they served alongside so many years ago, to touch the names etched in stone and to receive the recognition they deserve. In the words of President George Washington, The willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportional to how they perceive the Veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their nation. Without taking the time to honor and recognize the sacrifices of all service members, future generations will never understand how important our men and women of the military really are. This week, 100 veterans from the Permian Basin are taking an Honor Flight to our nations capital. Many will be in wheelchairs, and many more will have white hair peaking from underneath their ball caps. But they will continue to stand tall as an example of American strength, service and sacrifice. For truly, it was these veterans who ensured that our country did not perish from this earth, and whose selfless actions -- more than anything we can construct -- are the true monuments to the forefathers of our great nation. Final WOTUS Rule Announced Wednesday, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers announced the final waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule. This rule further obscures the original intent of the Clean Water Act (CWA) by significantly expanding waters subject to federal jurisdiction. Americas farmers and ranchers deserve a government that will review and address their concerns. Instead, the process by which this rule was established ignored them. Even input from the states was ignored, clearly displaying the arrogant, ""government knows best"" attitude ever-present in this Administration. Through hearings, letters, and public forums we have repeatedly asked the Administration to work with stakeholders to achieve the goals of the CWA rather than act as a schoolyard bully. Our requests were dismissed in favor of the expansion of federal authority despite bipartisan opposition from Congress and the public. It is ironic that the agencies defense of this rule is that it provides clarity to producers regarding what is and is not regulated. These hollow assurances hold little comfort for farmers and ranchers who will face steep civil fines for any violation. This is why the House voted overwhelmingly in favor of H.R. 1732, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act of 2015. We must enact this legislation that forces EPA and the Corps to pull this regulation and do as they should have from the beginning: work with states and local stakeholders to develop a new and proper set of recommendations. Obama's Illegal Amnesty Plan Takes Another Hit Tuesday, the Fifth Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals denied President Obama's request to begin implementation of his illegal amnesty plan. The President disregarded the will of the people when he implemented his illegal amnesty plan last year. The President himself even said over 20 times that he did not have the authority to act on immigration in the manner that he did. The State of Texas stepped up to lead a lawsuit against the Administration to stop the Presidents executive action from becoming our nations new immigration policy, and this decision is another step in the right direction. The fight is no where near over, but I'm proud to stand with the State of Texas as we lead this fight against the President's illegal executive action.

[D-MO5]","Secretary Julin Castro Comes to Town Cris Medina, Executive Director of Guadalupe Center, Secretary Julin Castro, and Congressman Emanuel Cleaver, II Yesterday, I was honored to welcome Secretary of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) Julin Castro to Kansas City, Missouri. As Ranking Member of the Subcommittee on Housing and Insurance, it was my pleasure to invite Secretary Castro to see firsthand the significant housing work being done in Missouris Fifth District and to highlight the continued need for HUD support in future housing endeavors. As I have shared with you before, I would not be where I am today without the benefit of a hand up  not a hand out  of poverty. Public housing helped my family when we were doing all we could to help ourselves. As HUD celebrates its fiftieth anniversary, it is time to look back at the dividends that place-based investment can yield. Nowhere is this more evident than at Posada Del Sol and Villa Del Sol, in Kansas City, Missouri, where families and seniors can find an affordable, accessible, welcoming place to live. Westside Housing Organization, Inc., the manager of Posada Del Sol, is a private, not-for-profit corporation founded in 1973 by neighborhood residents who wanted the City to improve the physical conditions of their neighborhood and save houses from being torn down for highway construction. Today, Westside Housing is one of the oldest and most respected community development corporations (CDC) in Kansas City, Missouri. It is the only CDC in Kansas City, Missouri that includes a significant focus on serving the Latino community, advocating on a range of social, political and housing issues. Congressman Cleaver and Secretary Castro walk down West Pennway Terrace alongside the Villa Del Sol Townhomes, as they discuss housing policy Four walls and a roof add up to much more than the sum of their parts. The residents here have a place to call their own, to build up their somebodiness. Without that, life can be very bitter indeed. Both Posada Del Sol and Villa Del Sol provide affordable housing for elderly and disabled persons. We had a chance to meet with many residents, my constituents, and talk about what is most important to them. It is important to me to keep fighting for full funding for HUD programs like Community Development Block Grants (CDBG) and Supportive Housing for the Elderly (Section 202 Program), which have made such a difference here in Missouris Fifth District, and around the country. Both Secretary Castro and I believe that we need to move past the damaging and dangerous sequester, which keeps us from making the investments our communities need so much. Even as we look back, we look to the future to see what we can do to lessen income inequality, increase energy efficiency at home, bridge the digital divide in every neighborhood, and expand access to housing for all. As neighborhoods change and develop, it is important to preserve affordable housing options. On our tour, we visited Villa Del Sol and Posada Del Sol Apartments. The tour was the latest stop on Secretary Castro's Opportunity and Investment Community Tour, which spans across the country to gain a better understanding of housing and urban development issues facing American communities. Secretary Castro believes that no American should be limited by their zip code. Through place-based efforts, HUD has made significant progress in building communities of opportunity across the nation. As communities wrestle with economic inequality, HUD remains committed to investing in initiatives that are proven to help families find pathways out of poverty. I could not agree more. Through community development investments, affordable housing and skills training, we must all work to ensure that Missouris Fifth District, and all Americans living in low-income neighborhoods have the opportunity to thrive.

By sharing your concerns and ideas with me, you are helping to ensure that my efforts are effective in solving problems that matter to you, to central and northwest Connecticut, and to the nation. Last week, I proposed an amendment in Congress to address concerns raised most recently at a roundtable I held in New Britain with women leaders in Science, Technology, Engineering, and Math (STEM). These women business owners, researchers, and grad students voiced the same concerns that I have heard from manufacturers, tech companies, and small business owners across central and northwest Connecticut. Namely, women are less likely to enter or stay in STEM fields in part because they lack the same mentorship and support opportunities as their male counterparts. Overall, women make up only 30 percent of the technology workforce, and only 22 percent of the leadership roles. Our competitiveness as a nation depends on robust research and technology, and on ensuring that we draw on the best and the brightestwhether they be men or women. Thats why I am thrilled the House adopted my amendment to the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act! My amendment increases support for women entrepreneurs through mentorship, education, and training by investing in supportive programs through the National Science Foundations Innovation Corps (I-Corps). Watch the video to hear my remarks on the House floor:  The original COMPETES Act of 2007 was intended to enhance research enterprise in our country, and I will continue to look for ways to enhance Connecticuts critical technology sector through my work on the Science, Space, and Technology Committee.

,114,Male,N00029459,43463,"Wittman, Robert (Rep.) [R-VA1]","Military Appreciation Month has been observed throughout May across the nation, and I was privileged to attend a number of events around the First District honoring these patriots. I enjoyed cheering on the runners and meeting a number of exceptional Marines and community leaders at the recent Marine Corps Historic Half marathon in Fredericksburg. The Historic Half is a fantastic opportunity for the community to join together in support of our military, and our local businesses and attractions certainly benefit from the arrival of many visitors to the Fredericksburg area. Later that day, I saw the same outpouring of community support for the military at the annual Some Gave All Foundation Memorial Motorcycle Ride in King George, which honors the memories of Army Sgt. Nicholas Conan Mason of King George and Marine Sgt. Joshua James Frazier of Spotsylvania, both of whom lost their lives in the line of duty in Iraq. The West Point community also honored a number of patriotic citizens over the weekend at a Vietnam War Veterans event hosted by the Daughters of the American Revolution. The spirit of service and the memories of those who have given the ultimate sacrifice are a constant presence in our region. Our men and women in uniform  past and present  inspire me each and every day as I make decisions in Washington that impact the military, from debating training programs and selecting equipment to strengthening TRICARE and military housing programs. Memorial Day is a timely reminder of the sacrifices that many of our fellow citizens have made to defend our freedoms, and I am truly honored to serve the military men and women and their families who have served our great nation. In addition to being Military Appreciation Month, May is National Foster Care Month. Nearly 400,000 children are in foster care nationwide, and while the system has made great strides in lowering the number of months a child is in foster care by making permanency the priority, 25,000 children still age out of the system every year without finding a forever family. As a child of adoption myself, I know how instrumental the loving, supportive environment of a permanent family is to our youth. If you are thinking about expanding your family, I encourage you to consider foster care as a way to give hope to some of our nations most vulnerable children. And if you have questions about this process, or about any issues important to you, dont hesitate to reach out to me.

,114,Male,N00035509,43689,"Young, David (Rep.) [R-IA3]","News from Iowa Congressman David Young  Home  About Me  Media Center  Services  Contact  Friends, It's no secret. There are real problems with the Affordable Care Act (ACA) - commonly referred to as Obamacare. Even President Obama has admitted this. There is still a lot of discussion about what should replace the ACA if the law is ever repealed or if the courts rule against key parts of the law. Earlier this year in Congress, I voted to repeal the ACA and replace it. Even for many who first supported the ACA, the law has not lived up to its promises of lowering premiums and costs, allowing families to keep their doctors and health care plans, or fixing the underlying access problems with our system. There may be some good provisions in the ACA, like protecting Americans with preexisting conditions, but the overall goals and promises made to the American people from the law have failed to materialize. My vision for strengthening our health care system recognizes Washington, DC, doesn't have all the answers and a one-size-fits-all approach like that attempted by the ACA does not work. By getting government bureaucracy out of the way, allowing doctors to do their jobs, and giving Americans control over their health care dollars and decisions, I am confident we can achieve improvements in our health care system - better outcomes, improved access to high-quality care, and real savings for American families. I plan to introduce a more detailed plan and eventually a bill in the coming weeks. I have laid out a few of my principles for strengthening health care - but I also want to know your thoughts and ideas  There's overwhelming bi-partisan support to ensure those with pre-existing conditions have access to affordable, quality care. This is a good policy included in the ACA . This is a no-brainer. We must allow individuals - and not just businesses - to pay for their health insurance with pre-tax dollars. If this is good enough for businesses, then why shouldn't it be good enough for everyone? All Americans should have access to tax-preferred plans to save, plan, and pay for medical expenses. These Health Savings Accounts should be expanded to further empower individuals and families to take control and ownership of their health care dollars. We need to also remember every states health care system is unique, so we must allow for state-based innovation in health care delivery. Rather than Washington, DC, dictating one set of regulations and mandates, states should be able to tailor policies to the needs of their residents with accountability. These are some of the principles I will be following as I continue to develop a plan. I'm not looking to simply replace one government-run health care program with another. What I want to see is quite the opposite. But I know I cannot put together a package that truly meets the needs of Iowans and their families and the rest of the country without your input. So, I hope you will reach out to me and share your thoughts. To do that, go to this form - ""A Better Health Care Plan, By The People.

junior,"113,114,115",Male,N00026586,412205,"Donnelly, Joe (Sen.) [D-IN]","May 29, 2015 Dear Hoosier, In recent years, our nation has lost hundreds of military servicemembers and thousands of veterans to suicide annually. It is more important than ever that we take care of our troops, veterans and military families, fulfilling our promise to provide the quality, accessible care and support they have earned. This is a top priority for me as a member of the Armed Services Committee, and I am working with colleagues on both sides of the aisle to improve and expand mental health care options for those who have served and sacrificed for our country. Last year, my Jacob Sexton Military Suicide Prevention Act was signed into law. Named after Hoosier Guardsman Jacob Sexton, this law ensures that every member of the military  Active, Guard and Reserve  will receive a mental health assessment every year. The Sexton Act was a significant step forward, but our work is only just beginning. Recently, I convened a roundtable discussion in Indianapolis to discuss military mental health challenges and efforts to improve military and veterans mental health care. I was joined by representatives from Purdue Universitys Military Family Research Institute (MFRI) and other organizations serving Hoosier servicemembers and veterans, private mental health care providers, and family members of those lost to suicide or suffering from post-traumatic stress. [photo] Senator Donnelly held a roundtable and press conference on improving access to community providers for servicemembers at the Indiana War Memorial. Clockwise from the top left: Donnelly speaking at a press conference; Senator Donnelly at a roundtable discussion; Donnelly and Gregg Keesling, who lost his son to military suicide; Donnelly and Jeff Sexton, who lost his son to military suicide. For high-resolution photos, click here. During the roundtable, we discussed my bipartisan Community Provider Readiness Recognition Act, which would provide new incentives to community providers to enhance their knowledge of military culture and mental health challenges unique to troops, veterans, and their families. It would also establish a regularly-updated online registry so servicemembers and veterans can search for these specially-designated community providers. This is modeled after work done by Hoosiers at Purdue Universitys Military Family Research Institute (MFRI). MFRI works with community mental health providers, naming them part of the Star Behavioral Health Network. When servicemembers, veterans, and their families see that designation, they know the mental health provider has been trained by MFRI to better understand their experiences. I am pleased to let you know that this bill recently passed the Senate Armed Services Committee, and I will continue to work toward its passage into law. One of the most critical hurdles to improving mental health care for servicemembers and veterans is overcoming the stigma attached to seeking help. It is my hope that through this continued effort to bring more accessible, quality care to servicemembers, veterans, and their families-right in their hometowns, we can show that seeking help is a sign of strength.

[R-NV]","Week in Review This past Monday was Memorial Day, a very special day allowing time to pause and reflect upon the loss of those who offered their lives for our freedom. Our nation's military men and women set aside their individual needs so that their fellow Americans could live in peace, safety, and security. I am appreciative to have been able to attend several ceremonies in Southern Nevada to pay my respect to the heroes who gave their lives. There is no better way to spend Memorial Day than honoring our nation's heroes with my fellow Nevadans. Last week, I had the opportunity to testify at a Senate Energy and Natural Resources Subcommittee hearing regarding two important land bills for the State of Nevada, the Good Samaritan Search and Recovery Act of 2015 (S. 160) and the Douglas County Conservation Act of 2015 (S. 472). Both pieces of legislation are extremely important to the well-being of Nevada, and this hearing marked an important step in the legislative process. Click here to watch my testimony. I was also pleased to see a couple pieces of legislation I led pass through the House of Representatives and Senate. First, the House of Representatives passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (S.178). Included in the legislation was my amendment that ensures Transportation Security Administration, U.S. Customs and Border Protection, and other Department of Homeland Security personnel are trained and equipped to better identify victims and perpetrators of human trafficking. The amendment also allows funds to be used to strengthen Internet Crimes Against Children Task Forces across the country, which investigate heinous crimes, such as the production of child pornography and human trafficking. The ROV in-Depth Examination (RIDE) Act (S.1040), bipartisan legislation introduced by me and U.S. Senator Joe Manchin (D-WV), was approved by the Senate Commerce, Science, & Transportation Committee. This legislation puts the brakes on the Consumer Product Safety Commission's flawed proposed mandatory standards for lateral stability and vehicle handling that could have unintended safety consequences and limit off-road vehicles' ability to access difficult terrain. Off-road vehicles play a major role in enabling many Nevadans to enjoy the outdoors and the Silver State's way of life. It is critical to the safety of Nevadans that these standards actually reduce the risk of injury, not increase it. I'm proud to see this bipartisan legislation, which ensures the regulation is implemented correctly, moved through committee on such a positive note. I look forward to returning to Washington, DC, this weekend to continue my work for the people of the state of Nevada.

[R-OK1]","June 2015 Newsletter ** Weather Forecasting Bill Passes in House ------------------------------------------------------------ On May 19th, the House of Representatives unanimously approved H.R. 1561 (, the Lucas-Bridenstine Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act of 2015. This legislation prioritizes the protection of lives and property. In Oklahoma, we know all too well the devastating effects of severe weather. The importance of accurate forecasts cannot be overstated. Our aim is to have zero deaths from tornadoes and other extreme weather events. This bill gets us closer to that day. H.R. 1561 is the product of over two years of bipartisan negotiations and is substantially similar to Congressman Bridenstines Weather Forecasting Improvement Act of 2014. The House of Representatives bill directs the Administrator of the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to: * Rebalance NOAA funding to place a higher priority on weather-related research and activities. * Emphasize the development of accurate forecasts and timely warnings of high impact weather events. * Create tornado and hurricane warning extension programs specifically tasked with extending warning lead times and improved forecasts for these particularly damaging weather events. * Develop a plan to regain U.S. superiority in weather modeling and forecasts. We currently lag behind Europe, Canada, and the U.K. NOAA should utilize advanced radar, aerial observing systems, improved high performance computing, and next generation weather models, and carry out Observing System Simulation Experiments. Weather forecasting is not a partisan issue. I am grateful to my House colleagues for recognizing the importance of improving our understanding of weather in order to better safeguard our constituents. Rep.

[R-KS1]","Congressman Tim Huelskamp ----------------------------------- * Using the Constitutional Power of the Purse* James Madison  the Father of our Constitution  said that the Power of the Purse was the most complete and effectual weapon with which any constitution can arm the immediate representatives of the peopleto protect the rights of the American people and address injustices against them from the federal government. Under the Constitution, only Congress has the power to permit the spending of our tax money. And with this Power of the Purse comes the ability to stop Washington bureaucrats and even a president, whom I believe is grabbing unconstitutional powers. It is one of the best tools for me to protect you on the big issues: - Stopping the EPAs over-reaching Waters of the United States rule, which is a power grab by the EPA seeks to regulate nearly every drop of water in America, - Prohibiting what I think is unconstitutional amnesty of 5 million illegal aliens, - Ending taxpayer funding and subsidies of abortions, and - Protecting Americans from violations of our religious liberties. [image = Congressman Huelskamp discusses agricultural issues with constituents * CUTTING UP WASHINGTONS CREDIT CARD* In the real world, we all have to live within our means. In our families, our personal lives, our businesses, our churches  when the bank account is empty, the spending has to stop. But this fact hasnt stopped Washington for years. As a result, today Washington is$18,200,000,000in the hole.*The President has sent us 7 straight budgets**that never balance.*Most members of Congress seem perfectly fine piling on the debt. And our children and grandchildren will bear the burden of this irresponsible spending. [image = For me though, it is simply wrong to spend money and spend money with no plans to ever balance the budget, much less reduce the government debt.You can count on me to continue fighting to cut up Washingtons Credit Card. * KILL THE ESTATE TAX* It has been said that there are two certain things in life, death and taxes. Unfortunately, politicians decided to make death a taxable event. *People work hard and pay taxes their entire life. These folks have earned the right to leave something behind for the next generation  not for the government.*The death tax sometimes requires farms and other small businesses to downsize, lay off employees, and even sell the business orfarm just to pay the government. That is why I cosponsored and voted for the Death Tax Repeal Act of 2015. Beyond this much-needed change, I also support reforms to make the tax code fairer, simpler, shorter and free from political manipulation. Whether the Fair Tax or the Flat Tax or a combination, it is time to abolish the Internal Revenue Service and get our economy growing again.

Commitments made by the Federal Government to the States helped minimize the damage to local economies and the tens of millions of dollars brought by sportsmen and anglers to small businesses and the often rural tax base. Unlike many Western hatcheries, where the Federal Agencies that caused the need for mitigation were required to fund mitigation, the mostly southern and eastern mitigation hatcheries have had to rely on competing interests of Water Development Agencies and the US Fish and Wildlife Service for annual funding. To help solve this problem, I introduced legislation earlier this month to provide a long term and reliable solution for funding mitigation fish hatcheries. Our 1st District of Arkansas is home to Norfork Lake National Mitigation Hatchery in Mountain Home and the Greers Ferry National Mitigation Hatchery in Heber Springs. Both of these hatcheries bring avid anglers from across to country to our region, and the economic impact is enormous. The bill, H.R. 2235, The National Mitigation Fisheries Coordination Act, addresses the uncertainty of hatchery funding. In the past, different federal agencies have traded the responsibility of these hatcheries back and forth, and the uncertainty created by that current system (or lack thereof) keeps the hatcheries constantly concerned about remaining open. My bill would emulate the successful mitigation programs in the Western states by requiring Water Development Agencies to reimburse the hatcheries. H.R. 2235 has two basic elements. First, it requires the Water Development Agencies who are causing the need for mitigation actually pay for that mitigation. Second, it requires the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service to to develop long-term agreements with the Water Development Agencies that will satisfy the mitigation commitments the Water Development Agencies made to the states when the Water Development Projects were built. The loss of once bountiful fisheries that had drawn anglers and sportsmen from around the country should always be compensated. As of now, funding is piecemeal and voluntary, but our bill would create a permanent fix that ensures the hatcheries are properly reimbursed for the loss of the original species when these projects were started.

[R-OH]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email   Constituent Services  Issues & Legislation  Newsroom  About Ohio  About Rob  Connect  Ohioans deserve results, and that's exactly what we're about. In these past few weeks, I've had a number of bipartisan accomplishments, including enacting laws that protect the most vulnerable among us, make our environment cleaner and our industries more efficient, and help level the playing field for Ohio workers in the global economy. Check out some of the highlights: Combatting Human Trafficking  Last week, after years of Washington gridlock, we were able to pass three of my bills to combat human trafficking and sex trafficking in Ohio and around the country. My bipartisan legislation passed both houses of Congress as part of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act and are now on their way to being signed by the President. This marks an important step in the fight to end this modern-day form of slavery and is the most the significant legislation of its kind in more than a decade. One key bill included is my Bringing Missing Children Home Act  , which I coauthored with Senator Schumer (D-NY), and improves how the cases of missing children are handled and strengthens the information needed for law enforcement officials to find missing kids. Because of this legislation, it will be required to add a photograph to a missing child's file if it's available. All too often children are reported missing, but we don't have enough information or a picture to help find them. As an example, since January 1, 2014 there have been more than 170 children reported missing in Ohio and yet we only have pictures of about 50 of them. This bill is an important part of reversing that and helping find the vulnerable young people before a trafficker does. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act also takes important steps to protect and improve treatment of victims. It does so by adopting my legislation to replace the term ""child prostitution"" with ""child sex trafficking"" to make sure we treat children who have been sex trafficked as victims and not criminals, so they can receive the support they need. Also included is my Ensuring a Better Response for Victims of Child Sex Trafficking  , a bill I authored to require that kids who are victims of sex trafficking are treated as victims of child abuse. This will allow more victims access to the services of the child welfare system while they recover. While it is important to find and treat victims, it is also vital that we crack down on the perpetrators of these crimes. The Combat Human Trafficking Act  , which I coauthored with Senator Feinstein, (D-CA) will meet that objective, and major provisions of it are now set to be signed into law. This legislation makes it easier for law enforcement agencies to investigate and prosecute those involved in sex trafficking by targeting the buyers and not just sellers. Strengthening our laws to target buyers will reduce demand for child victims and send a clear message to those who victimize children that they will be prosecuted to the full extent of the law. Watch a report about this legislation here  . Achieving a Cleaner Environment and Economic Growth Earlier this month, President Obama signed into law  a bill I authored promoting energy efficiency in federal buildings, commercial space, and with appliances. It is part of a larger initiative I've been working on over the past four years to help improve the environment and make America more energy secure without sacrificing jobs. The broader Energy Savings and Industrial Competitiveness Act is estimated to create 190,000 good-paying new jobs by incentivizing new energy efficiency technologies for commercial, industrial and residential sectors of our economy. It also lowers utility bills for working families, saving consumers an estimated $16 billion a year. Watch coverage of the legislation being signed into law here  .  Today, too many middle-class families in Ohio are being squeezed by a combination of flat wages and higher health care, energy, education, food and other costs. The energy efficiency legislation helps relieve that middle class squeeze by lowering energy bills and allowing workers to keep more of their hard earned paychecks. It also helps the environment by reducing carbon emissions equivalent to taking 22 million cars off the road by 2030. Leveling the Playing Field on Trade  Over the past several weeks, I have been fighting for more exports which means more jobs and fighting against countries who break the rules, so our workers can get a fair shake. Trade promotion is important because expanding exports and having the 95 percent of people who live outside of America buy more products stamped 'Made in America' is good for jobs in Ohio. You cannot be for good-paying, middle class jobs if you don't support exports. But while we open up markets for products made and grown in Ohio, we must also be sure that we are protecting our workers and farmers from unfair trade practices by global competitors. The right thing for Ohio workers and Ohio farmers is to promote a balanced approach that expands exports while leveling the playing field. I am pleased that my Level the Playing Field amendment with Senator Sherrod Brown which supports Ohio manufacturers and steelworkers has passed the Senate and is in the House version of the Customs bill. Our measure ensures that American workers can remain globally competitive by holding foreign countries and foreign companies accountable when they skirt the rules by illegally underselling or subsidizing imports. This is great news for Ohio workers, particularly steelworkers, and Senator Brown and I are working hard to ensure this important provision is signed into law. I am also pleased that I was able to include some of my other provisions to give Ohio workers and farmers a fair shake in the global market. The trade bill includes an extension of Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) that provides important protections for American workers and families looking to get back on their feet. TAA also includes an extension of the Health Coverage Tax Credit which is vital for USW retirees and Delphi salaried retirees especially in the Youngstown, Dayton, and Sandusky areas. I authored the bipartisan bill to extend the HCTC, and am delighted that this legislation has passed the Senate and is expected to pass the House. My team and I will continue to put Ohio first, as we reach out and work with anyone -- Republican or Democrat -- who will help us get good things done for Ohio.

[R-VA4]"," This month, the House passed the annual defense policy bill (H.R. 1735), which seeks to maintain current capabilities, prepare for future threats, sustain Americas technological advantage in the years ahead, and maintain a stable military balance to deter conflict and secure the interests of the United States and its allies. This bill was overwhelmingly passed by the House Armed Services Committee and later passed by a bipartisan vote on the House floor. Defense Secretary Ash Carter, however, openly rejected the proposal, calling it a road to nowhere at a Senate hearing. Despite the fact that Secretary Carter acknowledged sequestration would be devastating for the military and cause a crisis in national defense, he stated his support of the Administrations determination to veto any bill that lifts sequestration from defense, if it does not also lift it from the IRS, EPA, and other federal agencies that are not related to national security. Watch Congressman Forbes questioning Secretary Carter about the impacts of sequestration on national security, here. Congressman Forbes has warned Secretary Carter that his primary objective, as Secretary of Defense, must be providing our men and women in uniform the resources they need to execute their missions and return home safely  not funding domestic agencies.

[R-NE3]","  Home  Serving You  Issues  Newsroom  Contact Adrian  About the District  About Adrian  Weekly E-newsletter - May 29, 2015 Photo of the Week:   It was an honor to attend the send-off ceremony for approximately 75 Nebraska National Guard soldiers in Grand Island this afternoon. We pray for our men and women currently serving in our Armed Forces and thank them for representing the greatness of America. E-news: Congressional Watchdogs in Washington During the week following Memorial Day, I had the opportunity to travel around the Third District and talk with many Nebraskans about what is happening in Washington. Most commonly, I heard concerns about the growth of government and questions about what is being done to rein in the executive branch. Oversight is a key responsibility of Congress, and we are working tirelessly to push back on executive overreach. One of our main oversight goals on the House Ways and Means Committee is to put Congress in the driver's seat on U.S. trade initiatives. In early May, the Committee passed the Trade Priorities and Accountability Act, legislation also known as Trade Promotion Authority or TPA. This bill would give Congress the ability to direct and oversee the administration's trade negotiations. The Senate passed the Bipartisan Congressional Trade Priorities and Accountability Act just before Memorial Day, and the legislation will soon come to the House floor for a vote. Right now, President Obama has the constitutional authority to negotiate a trade agreement with any country he wishes and with no congressional oversight or transparency. TPA reins in the President's authority, requiring the administration's negotiating process to be directed by Congress. Under this legislation, the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative must promptly provide the classified texts of all trade negotiations to any Members of Congress who request them. To provide even more transparency, the law would require the text of any completed trade agreement to be made public online for at least 60 days before the President signs it. If a trade agreement is deemed by Congress to meet all the required objectives under TPA, it would be given an up-or-down vote. If not, TPA has a built-in off switch to stop the agreement from moving forward. We need to pass TPA to ensure Congress can oversee every aspect of U.S. trade negotiations and enforce the objectives important to all Americans, from agriculture producers to manufacturers to consumers. The administration's actions through the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) also continue to require congressional oversight. Just this week, we learned the IRS released nearly 100,000 people's personal information through a breach of its own website. This is the latest cause for major concern from an agency which targeted Americans for their political beliefs and later claimed former top official Lois Lerner's emails could not be recovered. The congressional investigation into the IRS is continuing. Thousands of Lois Lerner's emails have recently been found and are being examined by Congress with the hope of finding further insight into the agency's practices. The Ways and Means Committee, which has jurisdiction over the tax code, continues to hold hearings on actions taken by IRS officials. This week, I joined 23 of my Committee colleagues in sending a letter to the Department of Justice requesting an update on the criminal referral of Lois Lerner. Though the agency is likely hoping its delays and diversions will cause Congress to veer off course, we will not stop investigating the IRS until we find real answers. Though I always look forward to busy weeks spent in Nebraska's Third District, it is time to get back to Washington and continue to fight against executive overreach. We have a lot to do, and I remain committed to fulfilling the legislative branch's responsibility to provide vigilant oversight of the President and the administration.

[R-IA]","News and Alerts from Senator Grassley Breaking: EPA, Administration Fail Consumers on Biofuels The Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) today announced the proposed Renewable Fuel Standard volume requirements for 2014, 2015, and 2016. Senator Grassley has been a leading advocate of a strong Renewable Fuel Standard and expressed his disappointment in the EPA's proposal. Its Christmas in May for Big Oil. President Obamas EPA continues to buy into Big Oils argument that the infrastructure isnt in place to handle the fuel volumes required by law. Big Oils obstruction and the EPAs delays and indecision have harmed biofuel producers and delayed infrastructure developments. While I support the Agriculture Departments efforts to promote alternative fuel infrastructure, if the program were allowed to function as intended, private investments already would have been made. Todays proposal is just as harmful to biofuels as what the EPA put out in November 2013, and its 18 months late. What happened to the President who claimed to support biofuels? He seems to have disappeared, to the detriment of consumers and our countrys fuel needs."" An Iowa biodiesel producer expressed disappointment that the proposal isnt allowing growth. He said his plant has been idle or operating under capacity for months. Senator Grassley encourages Iowans to comment on the new proposal.

I've enjoyed hearing from so many of you over the past few days and I look forward to taking your message back with me to Washington. Here's a quick update on how I'm working on your behalf: Fighting Back Against the EPA's Land Grab This week I met with farmers in both Springfield and Jamestown to talk about the Environmental Protection Agency's overreaching ""waters of the United States"" (WOTUS) rule and how it will impact land owners here in middle Tennessee. First proposed in April 2014 and finalized on Wednesday, the EPA's rule would completely rewrite the definition of ""navigable waters"" under the Clean Water Act. This, in turn, would dramatically expand the EPA's authority and limit the decision rights of landowners and local governments. That is why the national Farm Bureau President called the regulation, ""The biggest federal land grab . . that we've seen to date."" Implementation of this rule could be especially devastating for our rural Congressional district, which is home to some 13,000 farms. Under WOTUS, everyday farming activities including planting, plowing, fertilizing, and construction near ditches, drainages, or low areas that could collect water, could land farmers with a $37,500 daily penalty for each individual violation unless they go through the time consuming process of obtaining a permit. Tennessee farmers should never require a permission slip from Washington to work their land and make decisions about their property. That is why the House recently voted to pass the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act of 2015,which would halt the irresponsible WOTUS rule from being implemented. The bill is now awaiting Senate action. Pressing Forward with the FIREARM Act Last month, I wrote  to you about the FIREARM Act, legislation I introduced to protect our 2nd amendment rights from intrusive, irrelevant government questioning. I am pleased to report that my bill has gained new traction recently with the introduction of a bipartisan Senate companion bill  sponsored by Senator Roy Blunt. Americans should never have to play a game of 20 questions with Uncle Sam just to access their Constitutionally protected right to keep and bear arms. That is why our bill would ban the government from continuing to ask questions related to race and ethnicity as part of the paperwork required for firearm sales. Today, I joined ""Cam & Company"" on NRA News to give an update about the bill and discuss our next steps moving forward. You can watch a video of our interview here  . An Update on the Murfreesboro VA Recently, I shared  with you about my letter  to VA Secretary Robert McDonald demanding a federal investigation of the VA facility in Murfreesboro. I sent this letter after multiple sources reported to my office that the facility was not admitting new hospital patients, that the facility was once left without a physician to staff the premises, and that its intern arrangement with Meharry Medical College was not renewed, leaving the facility short staffed. The reports further stated that the emergency room in Murfreesboro is closed and now functions as an urgent care center that closes at 8:00 PM daily - a claim that the Murfreesboro VA has since admitted as fact. Yesterday we learned that, in the wake of our calls for an independent report on the Murfreesboro facility, the VA finally announced plans for modest improvements at this hospital that will allow for better care of middle Tennessee veterans. While I certainly welcome these changes, it should never require a Congressional request for a federal investigation to get the VA to act on behalf of our nation's heroes. Many unanswered questions remain and we will continue to press forward with our calls for a full report on this matter so that we can ensure these mistakes are not repeated. Read more here  .

,114,Male,N00009154,43313,"Goodlatte, Bob (Rep.) [R-VA6]"," Rep. Bob Goodlatte They Feel Pain Human life is a precious gift. As a father who has recently become a grandfather, I know that the gift of life is one that must be fiercely protected. Since the Supreme Court's decision in Roe v. Wade more than 40 years ago, medical knowledge regarding the development of unborn babies has advanced dramatically. Extensive medical research shows that unborn children begin to feel pain by 20 weeks after conception, and probably earlier. Congress has the power, and the responsibility, to acknowledge these developments in our understanding of the ability of unborn children to feel pain. Earlier this month, I was proud to vote in the U.S. House of Representatives in support of H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. This bipartisan legislation would ban abortions, with limited exceptions, in the United States after 20 weeks post conception - the point at which scientific evidence shows the unborn can experience great suffering. Click here to watch my speech on the House floor in support of H.R. 36. Some have called the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act extreme, yet the polls demonstrate astounding public support for the protections provided by this bill. A Quinnipiac poll found that a majority of Americans support a ban on abortions after 20 weeks or earlier. Among women, 68 percent support a ban on abortion at 20 weeks or earlier, including 66 percent of single women and 71 percent of married women. A Washington Post poll similarly found 66 percent of Americans support restrictions on abortion at 20 weeks or earlier. As one of the few countries that allow elective, late-term abortions, America is not in good company. North Korea and China, which are not known as bastions of human rights, also still allow this practice. However, these polls show the American people want to change that. Delivered or not, it has been shown that babies can feel pain at least 20 weeks after conception, more than halfway through a pregnancy. They can feel this pain, and they deserve to live. It is rare for the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office (CBO) to be so confident that a bill would save lives that it makes an estimate as to the number of lives that would be saved should it be enacted. But the CBO did just that, conservatively estimating that this bill would save 2,500 lives each year. As Chairman of the House Judiciary Committee, I was pleased to help shepherd H.R. 36 through the House as we took a stand for the right to life and passed legislation that provides necessary protections for unborn children. This bill also includes provisions to protect the life of the mother, and additional exceptions for cases of rape and incest. As the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act heads to the Senate for consideration, I urge my colleagues to support H.R. 36 - if not on behalf of unborn children, then on behalf of the American voters they represent who overwhelmingly support this bill. Court Blocks President's Executive Overreach A court decision out this week is another victory for the Constitution and the American people. On Tuesday, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit refused to lift the injunction against President Obama's unilaterally created immigration programs. President Obama's executive overreach on immigration poses a clear and present danger to our Constitution, and I am pleased that the President's actions continue to be halted so that the states' lawsuit can continue to move forward. By acting unilaterally to rewrite our nation's immigration laws, President Obama has disregarded the will of the American people and violated the Constitution. Such lawlessness must be stopped so that we preserve the separation of powers in the Constitution and protect individual liberty.

The media is undoubtedly an essential part of our political process, but having microphones and lights in your face can feel pretty funny at first. Now, talking with our local press is something I (mostly) enjoy. We've got some great outlets around Massachusetts, and when I'm back home for a district work period I always make a point to check in. These conversations are an important way for my constituents to hear where I stand on the big issues confronting our Commonwealth and country. This month was no different. From ""Deflategate"" to opiate abuse to protections for the transgender community, I sat down with several of our local TV stations to weigh in on the news of the day. You can watch a few of those interviews by clicking on the pictures below!

,114,Male,N00031681,43585,"McKinley, David (Rep.) [R-WV1]","David McKinley, Proudly Representing the 1st District of West Virginia *The Unaffordable War on Coal* West Virginia has suffered the devastating impact of President Obamas War on Coal and this weeks headlines were a grim reminder. On Tuesday, the West Virginia Public Service Commission announced a 16% rate hike for residential customers of Appalachian Power Company and Wheeling Power Company. Thats a $123 million hike for next year. The increase is needed because [link 1] of a $407 million investment to bring Appalachians power plants into compliance with the Obama Administrations new regulations. The layoffs by Murray Energy and Alpha Natural Resources last week are examples of the hardships coal mining companies are facing. As government targets their operations, these businesses are forced to cut costs and hunker down. The endless stream of excessive, ill-conceived regulations coming out of Washington burdens our local economy by shutting down plants and killing investment. President Obama came into office promising to necessarily skyrocket electricity prices, and unlike his promises not to raise taxes or that you could keep your doctor, this is one promise he intends to keep. Watch him discuss electricity prices by clicking the video below: [image = skyrocket.PNG] [link 2] *Do Puddles Require EPA Permits?* On Wednesday, President Obamas Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released a new rule requiring farmers, manufacturers, and homeowners to seek expensive permits for puddles and ditches. Under the Clean Water Act the federal government is limited to protecting navigable waters but the EPA is now seeking to expand its authority beyond recognition. A couple weeks ago, *The Preston County News & Journal* wrote about the Houses response to this overreach. As I said then, the legislation we passed will order regulators back to the drawing board, with an admonition to listen to the very real concerns of people who would have their farm fields and ditches regulated in the same manner as navigable streams. Read the full story here [link 3]. *Playing Politics With Disaster Aid* Back in March, the Federal Emergency Management Administration announced a new policy requiring states to address what the Administration unilaterally deems as climate change before the state can be eligible for disaster aid. After trying to get answers for months, I joined a formal letter demanding FEMA halt implementing this blatantly political policy. This is nothing but more bullying by the Obama Administration to enforce their radical environmental agenda on the entire country. West Virginia has faced its share of natural disasters this year, and federal aid is supposed to be there in times of emergency. But now the President is threatening to take away that vital aid if West Virginians dont spend money we dont have on projects we dont need. You can read the letter here [link 4]. *What to Look Forward To* Next month in the House we will take up legislation to strengthen our energy security, push back on the Administrations burdensome regulations, and encourage job growth throughout America. By allowing West Virginians to benefit from our natural resources, such as oil, gas, and coal, we can put people back to work and keep energy prices down. My bipartisan legislation to protect the 316,000 American workers in the coal ash recycling and related industries will also see a vote in June. Currently, EPA regulations are confusing businesses and leaving them unsure what will happen to them under arbitrary rules. H.R. 1734, the Improving Coal Combustion Residuals Regulation Act, would give these workers and their families the certainty they deserve.

These severe storms have brought the worst flooding in decades, and perhaps ever, that our state has seen. Like all Texans, my thoughts and prayers go out to the families that have lost loved ones and their homes, as well as to the men and women going into harms way to rescue and help their neighbors. I want you to know that I am continuing to closely monitor the situation and its impact on the 12th District, particularly in the heavily affected counties of Parker and Wise. Our office has already visited some of the heavily impacted communities and is in touch with the Governors office in order to keep up-to-date with the most current information available. I have also joined with my colleagues from the Texas congressional delegation in signing a letter to President Obama asking that he expedite federal assistance to the affected counties. At this time, U.S. Transportation Secretary Anthony Foxx has already released $5 million in emergency funds to the Texas Department of Transportation specifically for use on bridge washouts and road repairs in Blanco and Hays counties. The situation will remain unpredictable as more severe weather is expected throughout the weekend and rivers and dams continue to crest. The total number of counties impacted is now 70, and this number is expected to grow. State and local authorities and law enforcement personnel are continually evaluating any potential dangers, and are the best sources for real-time alerts. Please be careful and use caution when going outside. If you need assistance with the federal government or a federal agency during this challenging time, please contact my district office in Fort Worth at 817-338-0909 and we will help in any way that we can. Tragedy oftentimes demands incredible will and determination from those who must confront it. Once again, Texans have shown themselves up to the task through the countless good and decent actions taken to help others evacuate homes, clean up debris and search for the missing. I also want to especially commend Governor Abbott, Judge Riley and Sheriff Fowler of Parker County, Judge Clark and Sheriff Walker of Wise County, and Judge Whitley and Sheriff Anderson of Tarrant County for their tireless efforts to protect life and property.

,114,Male,N00006863,43486,"McClintock, Tom (Rep.) [R-CA4]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email   HOME  | NEWSROOM  | ISSUES  | VOTES & LEGISLATION  | CONSTITUENT SERVICES  | ABOUT  | CONTACT  May E-News House Adopts McClintock Amendment to Stop Federal Agencies from Purchasing Scarce California Water for Fish The House of Representatives has adopted an amendment by Congressman McClintock to forbid federal agencies from buying up scarce water during California's catastrophic drought in order to release it into rivers to meet environmental requirements. The amendment was adopted as part of the Fiscal Year 2016 Energy and Water Appropriations Act. Presenting the amendment to the House, the Congressman noted that despite extreme drought conditions, the Bureau of Reclamation has continued to release tens of thousands of acre-feet of water because of environmental mandates. These purchases have exacerbated an already perilous scarcity of water while at the same time forcing the price of remaining water supplies even higher, he said. The Congressman's House floor statement in support of the measure: Water Amendment House Chambers, Washington, D.C. May 1, 2015 Hydrologists tell us California is facing the worst drought in 1,200 years. With the rain season officially over, our snow pack is just 3% of normal and many reservoirs are already drawn down perilously. Californians are now threatened with draconian fines if they take too long in the shower. This amendment forbids the Bureau of Reclamation from purchasing scarce water in California in the midst of this catastrophic drought for the purpose of dumping it into rivers to adjust water temperatures to nudge baby fish to swim to the ocean. As ridiculous as this sounds, that's exactly what the Bureau of Reclamation has been doing throughout this drought. It is using money taken from family's taxes in order to purchase water that's desperately needed by these same families and then literally dumping it down the drain in front of them. This exacerbates an already perilous scarcity of water, while forcing the price of our remaining supplies even higher. It also makes a mockery of the sacrifices that every Californian is making to stretch every drop of water in their homes and it undermines the moral authority of the government to demand further conservation from the people when it is squandering water so outrageously itself.

He discussed how Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) works, why we need it, and how it will help create jobs and grow the economy. Trade Promotion Authority will allow Congress to set objectives for trade agreements, ensure a transparent negotiating process and provide for a final vote on any agreement. Weekly Republican Address May 9, 2015 Hi, I'm Congressman Tom McClintock from California. Right now, Congress is considering important legislation to help create more jobs and prosperity for the American people. It's called 'Trade Promotion Authority,' and I'd like to visit with you about it. Trade means prosperity. More markets for American products means more jobs and higher wages for American workers. More products entering our economy means more consumer choices and lower prices. But here's the problem: unfair trade regulations, labor standards, high taxes and foreign subsidies often put American workers at a real disadvantage. To remove these barriers, we have to negotiate trade agreements to put Americans back in the game under fair and equal rules.

In his remarks the Congressman noted how recent negotiations have greatly strengthened the regime  at a time when it was most vulnerable from the growing opposition of its own people. The Real Problem with Iran Negotiations House Chambers, Washington, D.C. May 19, 2015 A large and respected Iranian expatriate community has settled in California, and it has been my privilege to get to know some of them in recent years. They are part of an international diaspora of five million people who fled Iran after it fell to Islamic fascism thirty five years ago. The stories they tell are blood curdling. One woman told of her cousin who had been rounded up in an anti-government demonstration and taken to prison. After several years, the families were informed that their loved ones would be released in the town square. The excited families gathered for the long awaited reunion, only to have their sons hanged before their eyes. A doctor told me of his college days in Paris. He had called home to tell his brother in Tehran of an anti-Khomeini demonstration. His brother was promptly arrested, tortured and imprisoned, simply for listening. A few months ago, after many years of silence, the brother in America received a call from his brother in Iran, telling him of the simmering unrest throughout Iran. The American brother told him to shut up  to remember what happened the last time they spoke candidly. His brother in Tehran said, I don't care anymore. They can't arrest all of us. All of the Iranian expatriates I spoke with tell me the same thing: the economic sanctions and international isolation of the regime was bringing Iran to the brink of revolution. This brings us to the President's negotiations with Iran's fascist-Islamic leaders. Any agreement with Iran's leaders is meaningless, because their word is meaningless. Iran's government is a notoriously untrustworthy rogue state that has made it unmistakably clear that it intends to acquire nuclear weapons and once acquired, to use them. The only way to avert this nightmare -- short of war -- is for the regime to collapse from within.

The committee this month held an oversight hearing on the impact of litigation on forest management, the U.S. Forest Service's response to the growing challenge of litigation and related impacts upon forest health. Supervisor Randy Hanvelt of Tuolumne County provided testimony at the hearing. Supervisor Hanvelt's district includes large sections of the Stanislaus National Forest, an area severely impacted by the 2013 Rim Fire. Congressman McClintock discussed in his opening statement the impact that litigation has on the Forest Service in both planning and management.

After two days in combat at the Kasserine Pass in Tunisia, Mr. Janofski developed a respiratory infection that ultimately took his life. For years, his family has tried without success to obtain medals in recognition of Mr. Janofski's service. I was happy to help this veteran receive the recognition he deserved. Visiting Local Food Banks  Food banks are a critical part of our community. They do such great work to help those who are in need. I toured two of these facilities in Escanaba today to learn more about the work they are doing and how the federal government can be of assistance.

It is their sacrifice that allows this great nation of ours to continue.""  _____ Rep. Mark Takano to Hold Student Loan Discharge Clinic  _____ Rep. Mark Takano Attempts to Restore Education Benefits for Servicemembers Attending Colleges that Suddenly Close Earlier this month, Rep. Mark Takano submitted an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) which would restore eligibility for Department of Defense benefits, including tuition assistance, if an individual is unable to complete their education due to the closure of the school. Last month, Corinthian Colleges Inc. closed its remaining campuses, leaving more than 16,000 students in limbo and thousands of employees without a job. It is estimated that the closure of Corinthian Colleges Inc. could cost American taxpayers $214 million. After the House Rules Committee refused to consider the amendment, Takano released the following statement: ""I'm disappointed that the Republican-run House Rules Committee refused to consider an amendment that would restore Department of Defense benefits to servicemembers and veterans who are unable to complete their education because their school closed. As we now know, for-profit colleges have intentionally sought to enroll servicemembers and veterans in their institutions specifically for their guaranteed benefits. With several for-profit colleges being investigated for fraud, and the closure of the largest for-profit college chain Corinthian Colleges, Congress should be working to help the students who have been left with mountains of debt and worthless degrees - especially if they are serving or have served our country. By refusing to consider this amendment, Republicans in the House have aligned themselves with the very worst actors in the for-profit sector, instead of our nation's heroes. While I'm frustrated with this development, I will continue to explore other avenues to help servicemembers and other students who have been taken advantage of."" _____ Rep.

[D-CA12]","#DubNation Honoring Our Heritage On Tuesday, I was honored to join with the Asian-American Pacific Islander community at the YWCA of San Francisco and Marin in Chinatown for a roundtable discussion on my bipartisan congressional delegation trip to Asia and offer an update on current legislation impacting the AAPI community. As stakeholders spoke of issues surrounding comprehensive immigration reform, the Affordable Care Act, student financial aid, and affordable housing, we had the opportunity to witness first-hand the diverse views in our vibrant community. We are truly blessed to live in a city that builds from the contributions and rich diversity of those who call San Francisco home. Please be assured that House Democrats will continue our efforts to provide good paying jobs by raising the minimum wage and increasing access to higher education. We will push for bold action to restore accountability, compassion and common sense to our broken immigration system. We will honor our heritage, our history, and the values of our nation by ensuring that every person has the opportunity to achieve the American Dream. Congresswoman Nancy Pelosi joins with members of the San Francisco API Council to discuss the recent bipartisan congressional delegation trip to Asia and provide an update on current legislation impacting the AAPI community. Thank you, Harriet Ishimoto! On Tuesday, I was proud to join with community leaders to celebrate the retirement of Harriet Ishimoto, the Immigration Caseworker in my office, as Mayor Ed Lee proclaimed May 26th Harriet Ishimoto Day in San Francisco. Harriets tireless dedication to public service has spanned over 24 years, beginning with her time with Senator Boxer and ending with my office, where she has assisted constituents with visa, immigration, and refugee issues. Thanks to her hard work and dedication, Harriet was able to aid San Franciscans with issues ranging from intricate, multi-national, family unification to life-threatening, high-profile issues  such as overcoming bias against LGBT individuals, increasing awareness for HIV/AIDS, protecting women facing domestic violence, and addressing visa issues for those facing deportment. Harriet, you will be missed by your colleagues, friends and the countless San Franciscans you have assisted in their time of need. We thank you for your years of service and wish you and your family all of the best as you begin your new journey! Casework Spotlight: My office was recently contacted by a constituent whose office building had been receiving mail sporadically throughout the last month, which was particularly concerning because the constituent is a certified public accountant and was processing tax returns during tax season. Upon learning of the mail delivery issues, my staff immediately contacted the U.S. Postal Service and requested an investigation into the situation. Shortly thereafter, my office received a response from the U.S. Postal Service stating that it had addressed the issue with the mail carriers responsible for delivery to the building, and that service had been fully restored.

We owe no greater debt than to these brave men and women in uniform who put themselves in harms way to defend liberty. I am forever grateful for their unwavering heroism. On Tuesday, I headed to Carroll County for a full day of events. First up was Coffee with the Congressman  Green Forest. THANK YOU to all those who came out! We had a great crowd and great questions. I appreciate you taking time out of your morning to share coffee with me. If you missed it, you can *listen to part of our discussion via KRZK [link 1]*. After coffee, I toured Carroll Electric, which provides power to over 90,000 consumers in Northwest Arkansas and Southwest Missouri (*Harrison Daily Times story here [link 2]*). My next stop was Wilson Combat, a custom firearms builder in Berryville. I finished my day at Eureka Springs High School, where I spoke to the students at their school assembly.

Solidarity Sabbath Last Friday I attended a solidarity Sabbath to support, promote and advocate for the freedom of religion, conscience and belief. Solidarity Sabbath is an ongoing worldwide initiative to promote the fundamental right of religious freedom and to confront anti-Semitism. According to the Anti-Defamation League the total number of anti-Semitic incidents in the United States increased by 21 percent in 2014, a year marked by violent attacks targeting Jewish community buildings in Kansas and anti-Jewish expressions linked to the war in Gaza. 57th Annual Garden Grove Strawberry Festival On Memorial Day weekend, I attended the 57th Annual Garden Grove Strawberry Festival, one of the largest community festivals held in the 47th Congressional District. It was a great honor for me to attend the event and participated in the parade featured many of our local veterans and also celebrities. This years theme was Honoring Our Returning Veterans and the Grand Marshall was Lt. Col. Patricia Murray from the California Air National Guard. The Garden Grove Strawberry Festival has deep roots in celebrating the harvest season and the strawberry farms that were a historic part of this area.  Congressman Lowenthal joins Congresswoman Loretta Sanchez, Councilmembers Phat Bui and Kris Beard. Started in 1958, The Garden Grove Chamber of Commerce put on the first Garden Grove Strawberry Festival as a way to bring together the east and west sides of Garden Grove. Since then, a group of citizens formed a non-profit organization, the Garden Grove Strawberry Festival Association to carry on the tradition. The festival is a charitable event benefiting local organizations and according to the organization, in the past 50 years, over $4.5 million has been donated to hundreds of non-profits serving the local community.  Overriding a Veto If the President disapproves of a bill that has been sent to him by Congress, this is called a veto, and the President sends it back to either the House or the Senate (whichever chamber the bill originated in) with a message stating his objections. This doesnt mean the bill is dead because Congress has the ability to override the Presidents veto and enact the bill into law., The override of a veto requires a recorded vote with a two-thirds majority in each chamber. However, neither chamber is required to attempt to override a veto, even if the other chamber does. The official question put to each chamber when the bill is brought back is ""Shall the bill pass, the objections of the President to the contrary notwithstanding?"" If the bill passes both chambers with a two-thirds majority, the veto is overridden, and the bill becomes law directly, without being sent back to the president. Historically, Congress has overridden fewer than ten percent of all presidential vetoes. The President most thwarted when it came to vetoes was President Andrew Johnson, who out of 21 vetoes had 15 overridden by Congress. By comparison, President Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who vetoed more bills than any other President with 372 vetoes, was only overridden 9 times.  Do you support the President's Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal? 6.5% - Yes, I believe the deal will be beneficial for the United States and raise labor, human rights, and environmental standards around the world. 8.2% - Yes, I believe the deal will help the middle class and working families by breaking down trade barriers overseas and increasing jobs in the United States. 71.1% - No, I think the deal will cost us American jobs and only result in more offshoring as businesses use cheap labor in poor countries. 14.2% - I don't know enough about the trade deal at this time.

Southwestern PA reaffirms its place as a hub for history and tradition  The South Historical Society was founded in 1995 with the mission to preserve the rich history of South Park. In 1975, Sam and Beverly Minor began processing and bottling hormone free milk from their family farm located in North Strabane Township, Pennsylvania.

The farm grows corn, hay, pumpkins, and milk from herds of Hosteins and Jersey cows in addition to a buffet style restaurant open 7 days a week. Once a year, the Minors open their farm up to the community during Farm Heritage Day and offer tours, demonstrations, and home cooked country food. Congressman Murphy was on hand to experience the festivities and to discuss the importance of farms in our communities.  Farm Heritage Day attracts hundreds of local residents to learn how milk in the past and today is processed across small farms in America. Farm Heritage Day attracts hundreds of local residents to learn how milk in the past and today is processed across small farms in America. Children learn the importance of farms and drinking your daily value of milk. In addition to taking part in Farm Heritage Day, this week Congressman Murphy was invited to tour the South Park Historical Society Museum located near the Park and Ride off Brownsville Road in South Park. The South Historical Society was founded in 1995 with the mission to preserve the rich history of South Park. The area was settled by trappers and pioneers, who discovered the rich soil. Coal mining resulted in an influx of population growth from Europe in the township. In 1910, the Bureau of Mines researched mine safety in Snowden Township and developed the trigger for the atomic bomb used during World War II. In 1966, Snowden Township was renamed to the more widely known name of South Park Township. The historical society supported Congressman Murphys recent action requesting robust funding for the Institute of Museum and Library Services Office of Museum Services.

Murphy Continues Review of Mental Health Care  Murphy delivered opening remarks at the Washington County Mental Health Awareness Day and Walk. As part of his ongoing review of our nations mental health system, on Tuesday Congressman Murphy was at Torrance State Hospital in Westmoreland County, which provides inpatient services for individuals with severe and persistent mental illness. Torrance is one of two Regional Forensic Psychiatric Centers (RFPC) in Pennsylvania, and provides services to 48 of the 67 counties in the state. Prior to touring the facilities, Murphy briefed the staff on his forthcoming mental health bill, the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act  . Murphys legislation would help hospitals like Torrance in their efforts to provide care to those with serious mental illness by increasing the number of inpatient psychiatric beds. Since the mid-1950s the number of psychiatric beds in the United States has decreased by nearly 95 percent, resulting in patients being left homeless or incarcerated. This trend has resulted, in large part, from an antiquated federal rule that puts an arbitrary cap on the number of psychiatric beds a hospital can have available for inpatient care. With inpatient psychiatric hospital care an integral component care for those with serious mental illness, Murphys bill would change the rule so that more inpatient care is available to patients in acute psychiatric crisis. We have replaced the hospital bed with the jail cell, the homeless shelter and the coffin, said Rep. Murphy, my legislation reverses this trend and provides help and hope to those with mental illness and their families. Earlier this month, Murphy introduced a bipartisan congressional resolution declaring May as Mental Health Month,  to remove the stigma associated with mental illness and promote public awareness of mental health. As part of this efforts, Murphys provided the opening remarks at the Washington County Mental Health Awareness Day and Walk. The event, hosted by the National Alliance on Mental Health (NAMI), brought together individuals with mental illness, family members, mental health advocates, and local community leaders to raise awareness about the mental health conditions that affect 60 million Americans each year. You are tireless advocates for your sons, daughters, parents, brothers, and sisters who must battle each day, through no fault of their own, an illness that is misunderstood and stigmatized.

[R-CO6]","Congressman Mike Coffman - Serving the 6th District of Colorado ========================================================= [image =  Dear Friends: Last weekend I spoke at several Memorial Day events to honor our veterans and to specifically remember those who served our nation and made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our freedom. Speaking at the Memorial Day ceremony at Fort Logan National Cemetery always has a special meaning for me. My late father, Army Master Sergeant Harold J. Coffman, is buried there. My fathers last assignment with the Army was at Fitzsimmons Army Medical Center which has since been closed and is now home to the thriving Anschutz Medical Campus. In 1969, at the age of 14, I volunteered at the Army hospital as a member of the Junior Red Cross during the Vietnam War. There we did what would could to make the lives of the wounded soldiers a little better given that their morale was very low. As the American people became more divided about their support for the war they also grew increasingly divided about their support for those who fought in that war. Many who returned were never thanked for their extraordinary sacrifices. As a member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, I want to make sure that the men and women who return home from the battlefield today are never treated like those who returned home from Vietnam. I also want to make sure that the men and women who serve our nation receive the health care and other benefits that they have earned through their military service. On the same grounds of the former Army hospital is now a half built, dramatically over budget, VA hospital that, once built, will provide the health care to the men and women who served our nation in uniform. Due to the VAs failures there is not currently enough money to finish the hospital and the question is where and how to pay for its completion. There are those in Congress who dismiss the need to complete this hospital and view it as a local problem. Next week, when I return to Congress, I will remind my colleagues that this replacement hospital was mismanaged by the Veterans Administration, a department of the federal government headquartered in Washington, D.C. and that the men and women that this hospital is slated to care for served our nation and it is this nation that has an obligation to provide them the health care they have earned. No doubt, I will also continue to fight to make sure that the VA is no longer in the construction management business and that an outside investigation is completed to make sure that those who are responsible are held accountable.

Credit Matthew Staver for The New York Times The Oxleys restaurant sits on an immigrant-rich avenue  sprinkled with taquerias, money-wiring services and Mexican markets  in a swing state that is likely to become a laboratory for the aspirations and anxieties of Republicans and Democrats in next years presidential election. Both parties are planning an aggressive courtship of Latino voters, with Democrats seeking to cement their hold on this critical bloc and Republicans trying to chip away at that advantage, perhaps by nominating a candidate like Senator Marco Rubio, the son of Cuban immigrants, or Jeb Bush, the Spanish-speaking former governor of Florida. This month, Hillary Rodham Clinton announced an immigration policy in Nevada (27 percent Hispanic) that calls for a path to citizenship, and said she would support and expand on President Obamas immigration actions. Mr. Bush has made a number of high-profile appearances before Latinos, including one at a town-hall meeting in Puerto Rico. Latinos in Colorado and across the country vote Democratic by more than 60 percent, according to the Pew Hispanic Center, and were a pillar of Mr. Obamas coalition in the last two presidential elections. But Cory Gardner, a Republican, unseated Mark Udall, the Democrat, in the Senate race in Colorado last year after breaking with Republicans on some immigration votes. And in Aurora, *Representative Mike Coffman*, a Republican who once supported denying automatic citizenship to the American-born children of unauthorized immigrants, held on to his seat in a district that was redrawn to become 20 percent Hispanic. Republicans say they revived their fortunes in part by turning away from the talk about amnesty and illegals embodied by immigration hard-liners like Tom Tancredo, who held *Mr. Coffmans* seat for a decade until 2009. The party lost Latino voters by more than 40 points in 2012, surveys showed. To change that, moderate Republicans said, candidates have to stop talking about border fences and self-deportation and plant roots in immigrant neighborhoods. You have to begin with treating members of that community with respect and not adopting that harsh tone that weve seen with some Republican officials and candidates, said Ryan Call, the former state Republican Party chairman. There is a danger with candidates pursuing the nomination. Some of the rhetoric and tone has the potential to alienate a significant amount of the population among our Hispanic neighbors. Whether they take that path may depend on which candidate emerges from primaries dominated by conservative voters. Interviews with Latino voters here and across Colorado also underscored the difficulty of scrubbing away an anti-immigrant image that has alienated potential Latino voters after two years of skirmishes in Congress in which the Republican-led House killed a bipartisan Senate bill that included a path to citizenship for 11 million immigrants illegally in the country. Christian Jimenez, 25, the son of Mexican immigrants who owns a cleaning business and ministers to drug-addicted youths in Aurora, said he agreed with Republicans on many issues. He opposes same-sex marriage, abortion and Colorados legalization of marijuana. But when it came time to vote, Mr. Jimenez said, he could not vote Republican. Immigration, he said. We have the same values, but they dont want to change on that one thing. If somebody had the right stance on that issue, Id work for them and canvass for them. Rigoberto Mendez, a caseworker for children with disabilities in the Denver suburb of Lakewood, said he considered himself an independent conservative, but voted twice for Mr. Obama. His parents crossed from Mexico into Texas, and he was born in the United States. He said the legal challenges to Mr. Obamas moves on immigration and Congresss failure to pass comprehensive reform had transformed the issue into a litmus test at the ballot box. The most important thing is what it is theyre doing to simplify the immigration piece, he said. They dont have a rap sheet, they are not criminals. They come simply to work. Still, Republicans in Colorado say candidates who support even modest immigration changes can bridge a gap between Republicans and Hispanic voters, and shore up support that has eroded in election after election since George W. Bush won 40 percent of the Hispanic vote in 2004. In 2012, Mitt Romney won just 27 percent of Latino votes, according to an analysis by the Pew Hispanic Center. Christian Jimenez said he agreed with Republicans on many issues but had been unable to vote for a Republican. Credit Matthew Staver for The New York Times They point to Mr. Coffman. Facing a suddenly diverse voting bloc and a fierce challenge from Democrats, he softened his stance on immigration and learned Spanish, one of 120 languages spoken in Auroras public schools. He and his opponent  Andrew Romanoff, a former speaker of the Colorado House  debated in Spanish. *Mr. Coffman* personally called hundreds of Spanish-speaking voters, said his campaign manager, Tyler Sandberg. Democrats called *Mr. Coffmans* shift an insincere conversion, but in November, he handily won re-election. These days, *Mr. Coffman* regularly meets with Latino church leaders and immigrant groups when he comes home, and is still taking Spanish lessons. This year, the states Republican Party set up a table at the Cinco de Mayo festival in Denver. They saw that out of respect for the community that I had made the effort to reach out, The Associated Press quoted *Mr. Coffman* as saying this month at Paxia, a Mexican restaurant in Denver, where he and the chairman of the Republican National Committee had stopped to promote their partys successes. Still, Democrats in Colorado have deep ties to the Latino community. Of the states 11 Latino state legislators, just two are Republicans. And in recent years, Democrats have passed laws giving drivers licenses and in-state tuition to unauthorized immigrants. This year, Republicans controlling one chamber of the General Assembly tried to gut funding for the drivers license program. The debate showcased the divide between conservative and moderate Republicans on how their party talks to, and about, immigrants. But low Latino turnout in the 2014 midterm elections also highlighted a peril for Democrats. The United States is now about 17 percent Hispanic, but at the ballot box, only 10 percent of voters were Hispanic in the last presidential election. The numbers are even lower in off-year elections. In Colorado, which is 21 percent Latino, only about 14 percent vote in presidential-year elections, and the numbers are lower in off years. Across the country, Latino turnout in 2014 was five to 20 points lower than average turnout, according to Latino Decisions, which studies Latino political participation. Of all the Coloradans who went to the polls last November to vote in hotly contested races for Senate and governor, just 8.5 percent were Latinos, the group said. Had they voted with average rates of voter participation, some 52,000 more Latino votes would have been cast. There was very little investment in Latino turnout, and it was too late in the game, said Arturo Carmona, executive director of Presente.org, a California-based group that has been pushing candidates to support immigration reform. He said overhauling immigration and whether candidates would support or dismantle Mr. Obamas actions would be critical issues for Latino voters next year. In November, a survey of 405 Latino voters conducted by his group and Latino Decisions found that 85 percent would vote for Mrs. Clinton. Organizers of Latino voting groups say they are already deploying in states like Colorado and Florida to try to close the chasm between the nations more than 20 million eligible Latino voters and the approximately 10 million who are registered. Ben Monterroso, the executive director of Mi Familia Vota, which tries to get more Latinos to the polls, said organizers were visiting high school citizenship ceremonies to sign up voters, and urging permanent residents to apply for citizenship so they would be eligible to vote by 2016. But Ignacio Leon, one of the owners of the restaurant where *Mr. Coffman* appeared this month, said he was unmoved by the politicians. He said that he cast his first ballot ever, for Mr. Obama, in 2008, but that he had been disgusted by the wobbly economy and inaction on immigration. Next year, he said, neither party would get his vote. Im disappointed, he said. It doesnt matter if its Republican or Democrat. I dont want to vote. It doesnt interest me now. *400 Attend Memorial Day Ceremony at Denver's Fort Logan* *By: Staff* *CBS Denver* [link 7] *Published May 25, 2015* About 400 people honored service members who died serving their country at the annual Memorial Day ceremony at Fort Logan National Cemetery. Gov. John Hickenlooper and *U.S. Rep. Mike Coffman *were among those who spoke to the crowd Monday at the cemetery in Denver. *Coffman* told the audience that the over-budget VA hospital under construction in Aurora must built, but said Memorial Day is about remembering the fallen. Hickenlooper said hes committed to remembering those who were lost. Ive never met a single family member yet, and Ive been to several dozen funerals, who werent deeply, deeply proud and grateful for their childs heroism; and their childs willingness to step up and defend this country, Hickenlooper said. Many of the white headstones were decorated with flowers and small American flags. I appreciate what this cemetery stands for and what this event means, Hickenlooper said. My mother-in-law and father-in-law are buried here; hes a World War II veteran, Denver resident Bill Young said. I think we need to respect them for the sacrifice out here that everyone gave. Three Medal of Honor recipients are among the veterans buried at Fort Logan, which has been a national cemetery since 1950. *One-on-One Constituent Meetings* *Saturday, May 30, 2015* *2:00 PM  3:30 PM* *Tallyn's Reach Library* *23911 E Arapahoe Rd* *Aurora, CO 80016* ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- [link 1] [link 2] [link 3] [link 4] [link 5] [link 6] [link 7] ========================================================= OFFICES Washington Office ------------------ 2443 Rayburn HOB Washington, D.C. 20515 Phone: (202) 225-7882 Fax: (202) 226-4623 District Office ---------------- Cherry Creek Place IV 3300 S.

,114,Male,N00005883,43276,"Brady, Kevin (Rep.) [R-TX8]"," Texas & America are Built for Trade The U.S. Congress is moving forward with common-sense legislation creating a healthier economy through fair, effective and accountable trade with other countries. Trade agreements with our global competitors where everyone benefits, everyone follows the rules and everyone has the same opportunity are proving to be key in selling more American products and services across the globe. Countries that America has trade agreements with buy 12 times more U.S. goods and services per person than countries that lack a trade agreement. We enjoy trade surpluses with our trading partners, but overall trade deficits with those we dont have agreements with. Thats important to workers and job creators in Texas, which leads the nation in global sales. Everything from chemicals to computers, energy equipment to agriculture are sold by Texas businesses each year  a whopping $325 billion annually, or an economy roughly the size of Colorado. This trade touches more than three million Texas jobs and 40,000 of our local businesses. Over the past decade Texas exports are growing twice as fast as the Texas economy. These trade-related jobs are paying more than average jobs and are more likely to survive in tough economic times. We can do more but unfortunately there are too many countries that still keep America need not apply barriers firmly in place, preventing us from competing on a level playing field for their customers. * * * As the former chairman of the Trade subcommittee in the U.S. House, I know that if America doesnt lead in free and fair trade, we will grow weaker while our foreign competitors grow stronger. And our factories, farmers and manufacturers will get priced out and shut down. Thats why Im helping lead the push to open Asia-Pacific and European customers to more U.S. and Texas products. For example, by 2020 half of the middle class customers in the world will live in the Asia-Pacific region. These countries are where the customers are at. This is where we need to be selling our Made-in-America products and services. Led by the House Ways & Means Committee and the Senate Finance Committee, both chambers in Congress will soon act on legislation setting the rules for trade. In the measure, called Trade Promotion Authority, Congress directs the White House to negotiate agreements to Congress priorities, sets the rules for consultation with members of Congress and lays out a firm timetable for considering any proposed trade agreement. Moreover, the legislation ensures that only Congress can change trade laws. And for the first time ever the bill creates an off switch if this or any president doesnt comply with the specific rules and standards of the law. * * * The key to Americas economic growth is creating a system of fair rules and enforcement so that U.S. products and services are always competing on a level playing field. Another key is giving American moms and other consumers more choices and better prices for the products they buy. This is helping stretch the paychecks of families and workers whose incomes have remained stagnant for far too long in this disappointing economic recovery. Texas is built for trade. So is America. Its time, through expanded trade, to preserve the economic principles that have enabled our country to grow and thrive over the past century.

[R-UT]","US Senator for Utah, Mike Lee [image = North Briton #45: The forgotten history of the Fourth Amendment, and its relevance for reforming the Patriot Act* The authorization for the Patriot Act will soon expire, and elected officials in Washington have been debating whether it should be renewed. There are those who believe this law, which was passed in the wake of the September 11 attacks, should be renewed with no changes. Since the last time it was authorized, Americans have learned that certain provisions of this Act were being interpreted by the National Security Agency to give this agency authority to collect bulk metadata on the phone calls of every American. This controversial practice has led to an erosion of support for the Patriot Act in Congress, and currently there arent enough votes in Congress to pass a clean re-authorization of this law. Americans across the country are rising up and demanding that their rights to privacy be protected. The Constitution of the United States protects the American people against unreasonable searches, and it does so against a long historical backdrop of government abuse. Over time, our founding fathers came to an understanding that the immense power of government needs to be constrained. They understood that those in power will tend to accumulate more power, and in time they will tend to abuse that power, unless that power is carefully constrained. Americas founding fathers were informed in many respects by what they learned from our previous national government, our London-based national government. They were informed in part by the story of John Wilkes. John Wilkes, not to be confused with John Wilkes Booth, the assassin of Abraham Lincoln, was a member of English parliament. In 1763 he found himself at the receiving end of King George IIIs justice. In 1763, John Wilkes had published a document known as the North Briton Number 45. The North Briton was a weekly circular, or type of news magazine in England. Unlike most of the other weeklies in England at a time, The North Briton was not dedicated to the praise of King George III and his ministers. From time to time, this weekly would actually criticize the actions of King George. At the time John Wilkes published The North Briton Number 45, he became the enemy of the King because he had criticized certain remarks delivered by the King in his address to Parliament. While not openly and directly critical of the King himself, he criticized the Kings ministers who had prepared the remarks. For King George III this was simply too much. This simply could not stand. So on Easter Sunday 1763 John Wilkes found himself arrested and he found himself subject to an invasive search. To learn more about John Wilkes and how his experience informed the Fourth Amendment, you can read more here [link 1].  * Deciding the Fate of the Patriot Act* This Sunday, the Senate will convene to decide the fate of key aspects of the Patriot Act before they expire at 12:01 a.m. on Monday. As this deadline approaches, it is becoming clear that he USA Freedom Act is the only solution the Senate can pass that would end the NSAs blanket metadata collection and storage activities, while still keeping non-controversial sections of the Patriot Act intact. After a landslide vote in the House of Representative of 338 - 88, it is unlikely that the House would pass any other alternative the Senate sends their way - even if they had the time. I have been doing everything I can to ensure that controverisal sections of the Patriot Act are not reauthorized, and you can learn more about these efforts here [link 2]. I will also plan to keep you updated on the progress of these efforts as developments unfold.

WOTUS Rule This week the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) released the final rule on the waters of the United States (WOTUS). After reviewing the rule, I am extremely disappointed that President Obama and the EPA have once again chosen to overregulate and ignore the concerns of communities and families across the nation. Multiple local organizations and small business groups, including many in South Carolina, asked for the rule to be withdrawn, only to be ignored by the EPA. Instead of trying to regulate private ponds and ditches, maybe the administration should focus on jobs and economic growth. I will continue working with my colleagues in the Senate to stop this EPA land grab and to ensure this Administration follows the true intent of the Clean Water Act. IRS Taxpayer Data Breach We also found out that a data breach at the IRS exposed the personal information of more than 100,000 taxpayers. While we are still in the process of determining who perpetrated this data breach at the IRS and what exact information they have stolen, what we do know is that it is absolutely unacceptable that this vulnerability exists. The amount of personal data the IRS has on hand, including social security numbers, means that the agency must do everything possible to ensure their systems are protected. This is especially egregious given the numerous warnings the IRS has received from federal watchdogs that its security systems are not capable of defending against online thieves. I look forward to working with my colleagues on the Senate Finance Committee to address these matters, and ensure that taxpayers know their personal information is safe.

As always, please let me know whenever I can be of assistance. Please keep in touch [link 1] and follow me on Twitter [link 2] and Facebook [link 3]. Also, for updated information check out my virtual office [link 4] and encourage your friends and family to sign-up for my monthly e-newsletter, the Aderholt Address [link 5].    Sincerely, [image = New Signature shaded background.jpg]    Robert B. Aderholt    Member of Congress  Protecting the Unborn On May 13th I proudly cast a vote for H.R. 36, the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. This bill prohibits elective abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy, the point at which an unborn baby can feel pain. As Members of Congress, elected and sworn to protect the Constitution of the United States, we have an obligation to protect innocent life. As Americans we like to consider ourselves to be among the most civilized societies in the world. That is why I have such a difficult time understanding why our law so many times continues to promote, support, and even encourage the act of stopping a defenseless human heartbeat. As long as I continue to serve as a Member of Congress, I hope to always rise to defend the most innocent among us with my vote.  [image = middle.png] *Congressman Aderholt, during a visit to Fayette Middle School on May4, 2015, presents the school with an American flag that he had flown over the Capitol.*   Keeping America First in Space and Science I continue to serve on the House Appropriations Committee and on May 20th the Committee passed the Commerce, Justice and Science funding bill. We have worked diligently to make sure it has a positive impact on Alabama. This bill ensures continued funding and in some cases actually increases funding for many NASA, Department of Justice (DOJ), and science related projects. Specifically, we were able to ensure adequate funding for a number of projects that will ensure America remains a leader in space exploration and science.   The bill also requires the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) to provide more for those seeking to produce independent climate model evaluations in other words, the bill will require the agency to provide grants to all researchers, not just those whose conclusions agree with the Administrations global warming position. There is a great deal of debate about the validity, causes, and consequences of Global Warming/Climate Change. Unfortunately, in the past, the Federal Government has routinely steered research funding only to those who agree with the Administrations stance on the issue to further their war on coal efforts.

I was honored to sponsor the National Day of Prayer event that took place on Capitol Hill at the Cannon House Office Building.  In my remarks at the service I took time to ask for prayers for those who live in countries where the very act of expressing your faith can lead to prosecution, persecution, and even death. I am reminded that we are so blessed to live in a land where we can openly pray for Gods guidance! May we never take that for granted.  Although it may technically no longer be the actual National Day of Prayer, I think we need to continue to pray for our area. I certainly appreciate your prayers for me as I work to represent the 4th District. [image = heroes.png] *May 1st was Lunch Heroes Day. The lunchroom staff at Vinemont School in Cullman County were great sports in helping produce a video [link 7]to thank all the lunchroom employees across the 4th District.* Memorial Day May 25th was of course Memorial Day. For some this is the unofficial start to summer, a day for grilling hamburgers and hotdogs, or simply, a day off from work. But its important to remember the origin of this holiday: Memorial Day is the day that we, as a nation, have set aside to remember those who laid down their lives for our freedom.   We can never repay the sacrifice they made, but I believe its very important that we try to pay tribute to these brave men and women who answered their countrys call by paying the ultimate price. We put together a video (which you can see here [link 8]) dedicated to those from our District who gave, as Abraham Lincoln said, the last full measure of devotion.  * [image = flight.png]* *Congressman Aderholt with Senator Richard Shelby on May 6, 2015 as they greeted a group of World War II and Korean War veterans in an Honor Flight organized by the Tuscaloosa Rotary Club.* [image = [link 9] [image = [link 10] [image = [link 11] [image = [link 12] [image = [link 13] [image = [link 14] ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- [link 1] [link 2] [link 3] [link 4] [link 5] [link 6] [link 7] [link 8] [link 9] [link 10] [link 11] [link 12] [link 13] [link 14] Contact Information: Website: Office Locations: Washington D.C.

junior,"112,113,114",Male,N00001489,400408,"Toomey, Patrick “Pat” (Sen.) [R-PA]"," Pennsylvania And The First Memorial Day The town of Boalsburg, Pennsylvania is in Centre County and has a population fewer than 4,000. It sits in a beautiful valley in the shadow of Mt. Nittany. Boalsburg claims to be the birthplace of Memorial Day - as do about two dozen other towns across our country. Having visited and met with the people of Boalsburg, I know they are right. Legend and scholarship tell us that in the fall of 1864, three local women visited the cemetery to lay flowers on the graves of a father and son who had died in the Civil War. As the women left, they agreed to return the next year to remember not only their loved ones, but others. The following July 4, friends accompanied them. Prayers were offered. Graves were tended. No headstone was left unadorned. Their tradition continued. And in 1868, May 30th was declared Decoration Day across the country. But it wasn't until 1971 that the U.S. officially celebrated Memorial Day on the last Monday in May. The three Boalsburg ladies are the creators of a rich American tradition and fitting tribute to those who gave their lives in defense of our country. This year, we celebrated Memorial Day on May 25th. I visited Hope Cemetery in Kutztown to attend the American Legion Post 480's Veterans Memorial Day Ceremony. Meeting with Pennsylvania's veterans is an important reminder that we owe our veterans a debt of gratitude that we can never fully repay. I encourage you to read about three Pennsylvania war heroes in my recent column here. Remembering A Pennsylvania Hero Do you know the name Mike Crescenz? Corporal Michael J. Crescenz was a Philadelphia native and served in the Vietnam War. He has a truly incredible story - one of bravery and heroism that made him Philly's only Medal of Honor recipient of the Vietnam War. And now, after my bipartisan bill passed the Senate unanimously last December, the Woodland Avenue Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Philadelphia has been renamed after this amazing hero. I spoke at the renaming ceremony recently, and I enjoyed hearing from Corporal Crescenz's family about his life and legacy. I hope the renaming of this medical center will serve as a reminder of the sacrifices of all of Pennsylvania's Vietnam War veterans. You can read about the renaming ceremony here. (Photo: Brad Larrison/Newsworks) Cutting The VA Backlog I am a member of the bipartisan Senate VA Backlog Working Group, and I was pleased to team up with Senator Bob Casey to unveil legislation to reform the broken claims system at the Department of Veterans Affairs. The backlog of veterans' disabilities claims in our state and nationwide is a disgrace. But we may not know truly how far behind the VA is in processing these cases because its management may have covered up the problem. Moreover, management may not have followed standard or basic VA guidelines for audits, or in some cases, veterans' privacy. This is simply unacceptable and outrageous. I will continue working with Senator Casey and other members of the bipartisan Senate VA Backlog Working Group to help tackle this critical and longstanding issue. You can read more about our efforts here. Honoring Our Nation's Fallen Patriots I am working to help bring dignity to veterans who have passed away but whose remains are still unclaimed. According to the Missing in America Project, there are an estimated 47,000 veterans' remains stored throughout the United States that have yet to be claimed. Unfortunately, due to red tape, it can be extremely difficult for the Department of Veterans Affairs, veteran service organizations, and funeral directors to determine whether the next of kin can be found. My bipartisan bill, the Dignified Interment of Our Veterans Act, begins the process of looking at how the VA handles these remains -- how they are identified, claimed, and interred. When our veterans pass, they should be honored in a way that reflects their bravery and sacrifice while defending our country. It is up to Congress and the VA to fix this and develop a plan of action to help resolve this important issue for our veterans. I am going to continue to fight on behalf of our veterans until both the House and Senate act on this bill. Read more about my effort here. A True American Hero Recently, I welcomed Staff Sergeant Earl Granville (Scott Township, Lackawanna County) to my office and he attended Afghan President Ashraf Ghani's address to Congress as my guest. Prior to the speech, SSG Granville and I took some time to discuss his time serving in Iraq and Afghanistan, as well as the important work he has been doing here in the United States. SSG Granville lost his left leg when an improvised explosive device detonated near his vehicle in Iraq in 2008. In December 2010, SSG Granville's twin brother, Joe, suffering from undiagnosed post-traumatic stress, took his own life at age 27. These two brothers served alongside each other in Bosnia and Iraq. I cannot adequately express my respect and appreciation for the heroic service they have given to our country. However, SSG Granville's service didn't stop there, and I have just as much admiration for the work he is doing now to bring awareness to mental health issues and the terrible tragedy of a very high suicide rate among veterans. He is a true American hero. You can read more about his visit here.

[R-PA6]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email  News from Representative Ryan Costello  Thank you for reading my weekly e-newsletter. On Monday, we all honored those who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our country and thanked all who have served and their families. The remainder of the week I took the opportunity to visit and tour many PA-06 businesses. A recap of the week: District Work Week: May 25-29, 2015 Lebanon County Tour On Tuesday, I spent the day meeting with a variety of groups throughout Lebanon County. I was pleased join many state and county officials at a legislative roundtable hosted by the Lebanon County Conservation District. Agricultural issues, regulatory burdens, and farming and land conservation practices were the primary focus of the discussion. Thank you to the Lebanon Daily News for covering the legislative roundtable  .  On Tuesday, I also had the opportunity to provide a legislative update to the Lebanon Rotary Club. I always appreciate hearing their views on a variety of topics including the need for a long-term highway funding bill. Meeting with volunteers at service organizations like the Lebanon Rotary Club is a great way to connect with the community. If youd like me to visit your group, please call my West Chester office at 610.696.2982.  21st Century Cures I wanted to take the opportunity to update you on a bipartisan initiative to promote 21st century medical innovation, known as 21st Century Cures. Headed by the House Energy and Commerce Committee, H.R. 6, the 21st Century Cures Act, is designed to break down barriers, promote advancement in technology and discovery, and restore and maintain Americas leadership position in the life sciences. Whether it is finding a personalized cure to a persons ailments or finding treatments for a rare disease, the 21st Century Cures initiative will allow scientists and researchers to thrive and harness findings to empower patients without the burden of government regulation. Last week, the Energy and Commerce Committee advanced H.R. 6 and I will work diligently with my colleagues to pass this bipartisan bill through the House by the end of this Congress. You can read my full op-ed as published in the Chester County Times that further outlines this effort.  In addition, I joined Newsmax TV to further discuss the 21st Century Cures initiative. You can watch the interview here  . UPDATE: Philly VA Regional Office On Thursday, the VA Office of the Inspector General released the findings of an additional investigation into misuse of a high-ranking position at the Philadelphia VA Regional Office. The report found that the acting director of the office misused her position and violated agency ethics protocol. This report reaffirms that a complete culture change is needed at the Philly VA Regional Office, especially in light of the previous report regarding severe mismanagement and purposeful data manipulation. I reiterate my call that those responsible must be held accountable and need to be fired. The distractions outlined in this report are not focused on the VAs mission of helping our veterans and their families. You can read the Associated Press article on the latest report here.  529 Day Yesterday, May 29th, marked 529 College Savings Day. According to a poll by National Journal and Allstate, 70% of respondents view the cost of college and graduate school as a major obstacle to getting a degree. As students finish up the school year and celebrate commencement ceremonies, I wanted to highlight legislation that the House passed earlier this year to help families and students save for their college education. H.R. 529 expands, strengthens, and modernizes 529 college savings accounts  . Specifically H.R. 529 would: * Empower students to use 529 savings for computers, reflecting the modern reality that a computer is necessary for college. * Eliminate an outdated and unnecessary aggregation rule required when the funds are distributed. * Allow taxpayers to re-deposit refunds from colleges without taxes or penalties. I encourage my colleagues in the Senate to take up this legislation in a prompt manner, so that we can get it to the Presidents desk for his signature. Next week, I return to Washington, D.C. where we will be continuing our work to get our fiscal house in order. I hope you and your family take the time to enjoy the beautiful weather this weekend.

,114,Male,N00007690,43405,"Walden, Greg (Rep.) [R-OR2]","A Message From Representative Walden  ABOUT GREG  ISSUES  CONTACT  NEWS  LEGISLATION  Dear Friend, This week, our nation paused on Memorial Day to remember those who sacrificed their lives to defend our freedom and way of life. When speaking at the Oregon Fallen War Heroes Memorial in Central Point on Monday, I was reminded of the poignant words of General John Pershing, the commander of American forces in World War I. He said of the fallen: ""Time will not dim the glory of their deeds."" He was right. Time will not dim the glory of their deeds, because we will not forget that behind each name is an extraordinary story of sacrifice and bravery. In Central Point, I also had the honor of presenting a Purple Heart to Susan Burke, who lost her brother in Vietnam. And I was privileged to speak at the Eagle Point National Cemetery where thousands of fallen heroes have been laid to rest. Later on Memorial Day, I stopped to visit with Bob Maxwell in Bend (pictured below). While serving in France during World War II, Bob smothered the blast of an enemy hand grenade by jumping on it to save his buddies. For his bravery, he was awarded our military's highest decoration, the Medal of Honor. Here's his Medal of Honor citation  .  >From left to right: Ted Lyster, me, Bob Maxwell, and Dick Tobiason Helping rural veterans get better care outside the VA On Tuesday, I met with a group of veterans and their advocates in Bend about the implementation of the new ""Veterans Choice"" program that helps rural veterans get care from private providers. As you might remember, the rollout of the new program has hit some speed bumps along the way. For example, the law that created the Choice program says that a veteran living more than 40 miles from a VA medical facility may go outside the system for care. Originally, the agency had calculated that 40 mile distance ""as the crow flies"" instead of the distance it took to drive there.  That didn't make any sense to me or many veterans in Central Oregon. Last week, Congress passed (and the President signed) a new common-sense law to make it clear that that the 40 miles is defined by how far a veteran needs to drive for care. The House has also passed a funding bill for the VA that increases federal spending for veterans' programs by 5.6% more than last year's level. The additional spending includes funding for mental health services, traumatic brain injury care, and resources for homeless veterans. It would help reduce the claims backlog by providing an additional $163 million in funding for VA claims processing. The bill also includes $233 million in funding for modernizing the VA's electronic health record system, continuing efforts to create a much-needed seamless VA/DOD electronic health record for veterans seeking care. We've also passed plans to encourage small business owners to hire veterans, to combat veterans suicide, and to recoup bonuses for VA executives that were paid out based on false or exaggerated claims. I'll continue to work to reform the VA and make sure that our veterans get the services and the benefits they've earned through years of service. They deserve nothing less. House passes sage grouse bill that would help Oregon's rural communities The U.S. House has approved a bill I worked on that would prohibit the Administration from declaring the sage grouse as an endangered species for another 10 years. This is excellent news for farmers and ranchers in eastern Oregon. A premature listing of the sage grouse could severely impact jobs in rural communities, so a delay would give states like Oregon the breathing room to implement local conservation plans without the heavy hand of the federal government getting in the way. The sage grouse provision was included in an annual defense authorization bill because an endangered species listing could impact the military's ability to train on key lands throughout the United States, potentially harming military readiness and national security. Eastern Oregon ranchers praised the bill. ""I am very glad to see the House act to delay the listing of the sage grouse. A delay would lift a tremendous threat to eastern Oregon that undermines ongoing conservation efforts that myself and other local ranchers and property owners are trying to implement locally. I appreciate Rep. Walden's continued interest in this issue and work to get this legislation through the House and over to the Senate for action,"" said John O'Keeffe, President-Elect of the Oregon Cattlemen's Association. I hope that the Senate will quickly take action on it. Livelihoods in eastern Oregon and throughout the rural West depend on it. Finding cures and modernizing health care Most of us have family members or friends who are impacted by cancer or other debilitating or deadly diseases. According to Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health, there are 10,000 known diseases in the world (7,000 of which are considered rare), but treatments for only 500. The Energy and Commerce Committee has passed a bipartisan plan-called ""21st Century Cures""-to help find cures for these diseases and modernize health care. For over a year, we've collected input from some of the finest minds in health care, like Dr. Brian Druker, Director of the Knight Cancer Center at the Oregon Health and Science University (OHSU), who I invited to participate in a digital health care roundtable last year (pictured below).  >From left to right: Dr. Brian Druker, me, and Rep. Fred Upton, Chairman of the Energy & Commerce Committee Our bill will help harness new technology and innovation while reforming slow-moving government bureaucracies to put us on a path to quicker cures and better, more patient-centered health care options. With this initiative, we are on the cusp of something really big and bold. For more on our initiative, click here  . Human trafficking bill to be signed into law Human trafficking is a global and a local problem. And we must take steps to combat it. I've worked on this issue with activists like Caleb LaPlante and Rebecca Bender (pictured below at a town hall in Grants Pass earlier this year), who are doing great work raising awareness about this modern form of slavery in southern Oregon.  >From left to right: Caleb LaPlante, me, Rebecca Bender Earlier this year, the House passed twelve bipartisan bills to help combat the scourge of human trafficking by boosting resources to law enforcement and health care workers to prevent and stop trafficking. And the Senate passed a similar bill, the Justice for Human Trafficking Act (S. 178), in April, which I was proud to support in the House last week. It is now on its way to the President's desk to be signed into law. This bill is a good step, but we must continue to work to end this horrific crime, for the sake of our children and the most vulnerable in society. New EPA rule muddies the water for Oregon farmers, ranchers, and property owners All across Oregon and the rural West, farmers, ranchers, and other property owners are wondering: what will Washington, D.C. try to unnecessarily regulate next? Where will a federal agency again attempt to curtail private property rights? How will this uncertainty affect already struggling rural economies? This week we got that answer when the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) finalized their rule to massively and unilaterally expand federal jurisdiction over water and private property. With the stroke of a pen, the administration has pushed aside the ""navigable waters"" limitations of the Clean Water Act, leaving in its wake vague definitions that potentially open up intermittent streams, vernal pools, irrigation ditches, or ponds to even more federal regulations. The EPA first proposed this rule under the guise of ""clarifying"" the scope of the Clean Water Act. But I've heard throughout Oregon that the ambiguous language in their proposal actually creates more uncertainty, not less. More red tape, not less. For farmers, ranchers, Oregonians, and others that utilize our water resources, it is a huge threat. That's why I worked hard to pass a bill in the House to require the EPA to withdraw the rule. The Regulatory Integrity Protection Act (H.R. 1732) passed the House on a bipartisan vote in May. 24 House Democrats (including my Oregon colleague Kurt Schrader) joined every Republican in supporting this common-sense measure. The House has also passed legislation that would prohibit funding from being used on this rule (this is on top of our successful efforts to cut the EPA's budget by 21%--$2.2 billion-over the past five years). The Senate should take up and pass these bills right away and send the EPA back to the drawing board. Our farmers, ranchers and rural communities deserve better than federal agencies strangling them with more red tape. It's time to ditch this rule. That's all for this week. Have a great week.

Issues  Contact Me  As a surgeon, I fought to save lives on the operating table every day. In Congress, I'm making it my mission to fight just as hard to defend the lives of those unborn who can't defend themselves. I swore an oath as a doctor to defend life, and I take that very seriously - whether in the operating room or in the halls of Congress.  I spoke  on the House floor to defend the unborn. In remembrance of the brutal and tragic Kermit Gosnell  affair, which happened two years ago this month, the House voted to ban abortions for unborn children at 20 weeks, the gestational age at which babies can feel pain. I strongly supported this pro-life measure, and took to the House floor to voice my support. I'll continue fighting for our Louisiana values and give a voice to those who have none.  I held  Hurricane Preparedness Forums in Lafayette, Lake Charles, and Morgan City to remind folks that preparation saves lives. The House also took action with my help to stop the EPA's power grab that will hurt Louisiana farmers. This agency has operated in a manner that is out of control - reinterpreting laws passed by Congress to give itself broad regulatory authority over drainage ditches and farm ponds. Imagine the chaos if every time a farmer wanted to fix a fence over a ditch or weed his field, he needed a federal permit. I supported  legislation that will end the EPA's power grab and force it to work with farmers and local stakeholders to come up with common-sense, workable solutions.   I'm being recognized  as a leader on behalf of our veterans in Louisiana. Thanks to the constant pressure of Senator Vitter and me on the much-needed and long-overdue VA clinics coming to Lafayette and Lake Charles, I've been recognized as a leader on behalf of our state's veterans. I am glad Senator Vitter and I were able to pressure the VA into granting  more temporary clinic space for our veterans in Lake Charles and Lafayette while construction gets underway on permanent clinics. I won't give up until our veterans have the high-quality care they've earned through their service.  I was honored to meet  with the Louisiana State Troopers to thank them for their work keeping our roads safe. I'm also going to bat for Louisiana's seafood and agriculture industry to protect them from unfair trade practices by other countries - and we're getting good results. The House Ways & Means Committee passed  legislation with my bill, the PROTECT Act, included, that will give more tools to stop other countries from distorting our markets, guaranteeing a level playing field so our producers and processors can compete. These industries make up the backbone of Louisiana's economy - I'm not going let foreign competitors come in and not play by the rules.  I was proud to welcome  my friend, Senator Cassidy, to Lafayette for the opening of his new Acadiana office. I am proud to be from Louisiana. It's my honor to represent your interests in Congress. Although we face significant challenges, I still believe in our state's promise. Thank you for the privilege of being able to represent you.

,114,Female,N00029077,43480,"Jenkins, Lynn (Rep.) [R-KS2]","Congresswoman Lynn Jenkins *Mental Health First Aid Briefing:* This week, as part of Mental Health Awareness Month, I hosted a briefing about what Mental Health First Aid [link 1] does to help folks in Kansas and around the country. Mental Health First Aid training is an early-detection training program that is critical to removing the stigma of mental health treatment and helping those that are struggling from mental illness. I was honored to introduce the Mental Health First Aid Act [link 2] along with Congresswoman Doris Matsui in April. Eastern Kansas has been a leader in mental health issues for years with great institutions like the Bert Nash Community Mental Health Centerin Lawrence, theClinical Child Psychology Programat the University of Kansas, and the Family Service and Guidance Center in Topeka. It is vital we share these important educational tools with Members of Congress and their staff so we continue to raise awareness for Mental Health First Aid. [image = Briefing.jpg] *Working to Resolve Colmery-ONeil Staffing Issues:* In August of 2013I first raised serious concerns about the apparent staffing problems at the Colmery-ONeil VA Medical Center in Topeka with then-VA Secretary Erik Shinseki. The departure of three doctors led to the closing of the emergency room, and after nearly two years, the situation remains unresolved and the emergency room is still closed. After numerous calls, letters, and meetings with the VA [link 3], we have received news that the emergency room should be reopening soon. Next week, Senator Jerry Moranand I will be visiting Colmery-ONeil to meet with director Rudy Klopfer and get an update on the situation. Our veterans deserve the best care possible, and I will continue to work to ensure this service is once again available to them. To read the Topeka Capital-Journals latest on the situation, click here [link 4]. * [image = and jenkins va.jpg]* *Working To End Human Trafficking:* Human trafficking is a growing epidemic around the world that happens right here in America, including an arrest in Lawrence that took place just a few weeks ago. Im pleased Congress acted this week to bring the victims of human trafficking out of the shadows [link 5], and enable us to better secure justice for its victims. This bill was a strong step towards providing better care for the victims of human trafficking and ending the unspeakable practice of trafficking once and for all. * [image = Trafficking.png]* *Encouraging Innovation Across America:* Not only does America have the highest corporate tax rate in the world, its also one of the few countries that allow various provisions of our tax code, like research and development, to expire on a regular basis. Congress has gotten into a self-defeating habit of continually extending tax provisions on a short-term, temporary and even worse on a retroactive basis. As a CPA, Ive worked with businesses that are small and large and I know this is no way to write tax policy. These businesses dont have a crystal ball and simply cant plan because the uncertainty in Washington is holding them back.  This week the House voted to make the research and development tax credit permanent. R&D is important to American innovation and providing some permanency will give businesses the stability needed to invest in the United States economy creating good paying jobs, fostering a healthy bottom up economy, and increasing wages for hardworking Americans. I spoke at the Republican Leadership Press Conference this week about how making tax credits permanent means businesses can plan ahead to get ahead and provide a much needed boost to the economy.

[image = Gates.png] *Participating in National Foster Care Month:* This week, the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth helped members host former foster youths from their district for a day in their office. I had a great time having Billie Boeck shadow me and it was incredible to hear her story. She is definitely an amazing person and I wish her the best of the luck for her future!

If we are going to spend the tax dollars of our hard-working constituents, we should at least do everything we can to spend them on American made products and projects whenever possible.

However, a word of thanks, while important, is not enough we must show it as well. Just as a soldiers service is never finished, our work to repay that service continues as well. This week, the House of Representatives took-up six pieces of legislation intended to promote Veterans talents, abilities and wellness: H.R. 474  Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Programs Reauthorization Act of 2015 H.R. 1038 Ensuring VA Employee Accountability Act H.R. 1313 Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Relief Act H.R. 1382 Boosting Rates of American Veteran Employment Act, as amended H.R. 91 Veteran's I.D. Card Act H.R. 1816 Vulnerable Veterans Housing Reform Act of 2015, as amended I also continue my work to cut down on wait times for Veterans with hearing aid needs. I am hopeful that it will receive a hearing before the Veterans Affairs committee in the coming months.

,114,Male,N00012672,43363,"Pearce, Stevan “Steve” (Rep.) [R-NM2]","Congressman Steve Pearce, Representing the 2nd District of New Mexico *PEARCE INTRODUCES BILL TO SECURE NEW MEXICOS SOUTHERN BORDER* U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce issued this statement announcing the introduction of H.R. 2467, legislation that will help protect New Mexicos local communities, secure its southern border and strengthen national security. It has been one year since the President misused the Antiquities Act to unilaterally seize 500,000 acres in southern New Mexico, said Pearce. Not only did this monument designation disregard the concerns of the people in southern New Mexico, it also has prevented proper border security measures from being carried out. We have seen this issue play out in Arizona at the Organ Pipe Cactus National Monument, which has become a human and drug smuggling corridor. We cannot afford for this to happen in New Mexico and we must not restrict the access of border patrol agents who work to ensure our safety. This bill does not change the size of, or, the monument. It simply ensures that the United States Border Patrol has unfettered access to the monument to serve the people of southern New Mexico and safeguard our nation. I call on my colleagues in the House to move this important legislation as soon as possible, Pearce added.  *PEARCE VOTES TO SEND ANTI-TRAFFICKING BILL TO PRESIDENTS DESK* By a vote of 420-3, the House of Representatives passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (S. 178), to combat horrific crimes perpetrated on thousands of American victims. Following his vote to pass the bill and send it to the Presidents desk for signature, U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce released this statement: Human trafficking is a despicable ageless crime that targets everyone from children and teens to adults. Often leading to sexual slavery, trafficking relies on kidnapping, child pornography, prostitution, and rape to perpetuate itself. Trafficking human beings must be rooted out and completely destroyed, stated Pearce. In January, I was pleased to vote for 10 House-passed bills aimed at aiding victims and eradicating this evil industry. The legislation approved today contains several of those bipartisan measures and will go a long way to hunt down and end this act at the source. It will help expedite the arrest and prosecution of traffickers, while also providing support to aid and help victims reclaim their lives. The job is not done, and Congress must continue to work with the nation to end this terrible practice. I applaud this bipartisan effort and I call upon the President to sign this critical legislation immediately, Pearce concluded. *NOTE: Pearce has cosponsored legislation to combat this modern form of slavery and worked with groups like Truckers Against Trafficking to raise awareness and advance community action. Human trafficking continues to affect more than an estimated 20 million victims worldwide, including hundreds of children and adults in New Mexico.*  *PEARCE PRAISES PASSAGE OF BILLS TO BOOST JOB-CREATING RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT* The House of Representatives passed the American Research and Competitiveness Act (H.R. 880) and the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act (H.R. 1806) -- bills that would incentivize research and development, promote innovation, and create good-paying jobs. U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce issued this statement: Scientific research and development has and continues to improve our lives. From new medical treatments, to a new microchip improving computing power  innovation has long transformed life in the United States and around the world. Congress must continue to promote and support these efforts. Passage of HR 880 and HR 1806 will support this goal nationwide, stated Pearce. The United States has long been in the business of changing the world. From President Kennedy demanding that our nation reach the moon within a decade and our scientists meeting the challenge, to the creation of Google, which was supported by NSF grants  American discovery has led to countless amazing creations and milestones. I cannot wait to see how the researchers and scientists, benefiting from the Houses continued commitment to their work, will change the world in the years to come. New Mexico has a long history as a hub of technological innovation. From our national labs and universities, to businesses creating products and procedures revolutionizing their respective industries, the state plays an important role in technological advancement. A fundamental component of any business ability to grow and develop is budget certainty. Passage of HR 880 provides this certainty by making research and development tax credits a permanent fixture in the tax code. With this addition, businesses will have the confidence to push for greater development and expansion, leading to greater growth and job creation, something our state and nation desperately need. The American Research and Competitiveness Act [link 1]would simplify and make permanent the tax credit for research and development. This temporary credit has been repeatedly extended since 1981. Making it permanent would encourage innovation in manufacturing, technology, and energy development -- among other job-creating industries. The America COMPETES Act [link 2]increases investments for basic energy research at the Department of Energy (DOE), as well as critical research in biology, chemistry, physics, computer science, engineering and mathematics at the National Science Foundation (NSF), while keeping overall spending at Fiscal Year 2015 appropriated levels.  *CHECK OUT CONGRESSIONAL REVIEW WITH CONGRESSMAN STEVE PEARCE* Have you heard ""Congressional Review"" this week?

Theyve stared evil in the eyes and stood for all that is good in the world. Because of their heroism, their sacrifices have reverberated throughout the ages. It is their sacrifice that we honor this day, and every day. We must also remember the families of the fallen who are left to carry on afteras President Lincoln saidhaving laid so costly a sacrifice upon the altar of freedom.

Video is Worth 1000 Pictures On Tuesday, I testified before the Senate Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime and Terrorism's hearing entitled ""Body Cameras: Can Technology Increase Protection for Law Enforcement Officers and the Public?"" I also questioned  a panel of experts during the hearing. I strongly believe that body cameras are one piece of the puzzle to rebuilding trust and aiding our law enforcement officers and our communities. It is the best way to keep both officers and residents safe. If a picture is worth a thousand words, then a video is worth a thousand pictures. You can watch my full testimony below.   I continued the conversation on body-worn cameras with MSNBC's Morning Joe  , CNN's Jake Tapper  , and Neil Cavuto with Fox News throughout the week. Raising Awareness to Save Lives Today I joined Senator Joe Manchin (D-W.Va.) in launching the Senate Prescription Abuse Prevention Caucus. Prescription drug abuse has devasting effects on thousands of families across our nation. This is a problem we must tackle from every angle, and I look forward to working with Senator Manchin and our colleagues in the Senate to find solutions and save lives. Memorial Day On Monday, let us all celebrate those who have died for our great nation. It is our responsibility to say thank you to the brave men and women who sacrificed their lives for our freedom. Their dedication will never be forgotten. Hurricane Preparedness Week Hurricane Preparedness Week runs May 24-30. It is important that we all are prepared for a natural disaster.

We must always remember: If everything is a priority, nothing is. Last week, we focused on the priorities that move our state and country forward. The America COMPETES Act was originally introduced in 2007 to help prioritize and advance investments in U.S. innovation through research and development. Since this time, the law has helped set our research priorities to make sure everyone benefits. On Wednesday, the House put us on a path towards better job opportunities by voting to keep this law. The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act (H.R. 1806) is a good government bill that shifts federal resources to help America stay competitive around the world. This bill continues the goal of our basic research in the core physical sciences and biology, and requires the National Science Foundation to prove that it is using your tax dollars in a way that serves the best interest of all Americans. And most importantly, this bill reigns in the Obama administration's spending on massive and unjustified climate change programs. What do you think should be America's priority research areas?  Stay up to date on my work on your behalf by liking my page on Facebook  and following me on Twitter  and Flickr  . You can see all of the bills I voted on this week in the list below.

It is only fitting that, for nearly 150 years now, we have set aside a day each year in May to remember those who made this ultimate sacrifice.  Some years back, I had the privilege of serving in the Army. And today, as a U.S. senator, it remains a great honor to meet with so many of the brave men and women serving in our Armed Forces.

On D-Day my father climbed into his B26 Bomber, the AkSarBen Knight, and soon found himself in the skies over Europe. It was just one of 60 missions he flew over France and Germany during World War II. His dedication to our country has always inspired me. He taught me early in life to never forget those who serve our nation. This is a day, etched in our history, when we remember and honor the men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice. We are also forever grateful to all veterans and current members of our Armed Forces who have been there and are there for us. This Memorial Day in particular our Nebraska hearts are heavy with two recent losses from half-way across the globe. During a life-saving mission delivering badly needed supplies to the suffering earthquake victims of Nepal, Captain Dustin Lukasiewicz, 29, and Lance Corporal Jacob Hug, 22, were killed along with four fellow U.S. Marines when their helicopter crashed in that countrys rugged terrain. Capt. Lukasiewicz, a decorated UH-1Y helicopter pilot, grew up in Wilcox, Nebraska. Lance Cpl. Hug, a combat videographer from Arizona, leaves behind family and friends in Omaha and Council Bluffs, Iowa. Let us take time today to hold these heroes in our thoughts and prayers. And as we do it is time that we take hold of an opportunity to record the memories of our veterans to ensure that their stories are not lost to time.

We owe our way of life to their courage. Their willingness to fight is the reason why we live in a country free from tyranny and oppression. In honor of Memorial Day, Im happy to announce that the Oversight and Government Reform Committee this week passed my bill to rename the United States Post Office building located at 1 Walter Hammond Place in Waldwick, NJ the Staff Sergeant Joseph DAugustine Post Office Building. This action clears the way for this important legislation to be passed by the House of Representatives and sent to President Obama for his signature. As you may know, Staff Sergeant Joseph D'Augustine, a 2001 Waldwick High School graduate, was killed in action in the Helmand province of Afghanistan on March 27, 2012. He gave his life while protecting his fellow men and women in uniform. Renaming the Waldwick Post Office after a hometown hero would be a fitting tribute to this brave young man. As we remember and honor our fallen heroes like Staff Sergeant D'Augustinewe also remember their families. We offer prayers for the comfort of those living with the pain of loss. Nothing will ever replace our loved ones who gave their lives to protect the United States, but we can live our lives in a way that honors their memory. On this Memorial Day, may God bless the families who grieve for their loved ones, and may God bless all those who have laid down their lives in defense of the United States of America.

Though this day of remembrance is solemn, let us not only say prayers for the fallen but let us celebrate their lives and give heartfelt thanks. While this one day has been designated a day of national awareness and reverence, we should honor these men and women every day for providing the liberties and freedoms we cherish. What was once called Decoration Day, Memorial Day traces its beginning back to just after the Civil War. A proclamation by General John A. Logan established the first Memorial Day Observance in May of 1868. Mourners placed flowers on the graves of Union and Confederate soldiers at Arlington National Cemetery. Since that time, we honor all those who died in every conflict since the Civil War; the Spanish-American War, World Wars I and II, Korea, Vietnam and Desert Storm and the more recent conflicts in Afghanistan and Iraq. So today, lets us give thanks and remember. Let us visit the memorials of fallen heroes and make it a point to aid and comfort widows, widowers, and orphans of the fallen. Also let us not forget the veterans among us who have served honorably and often carry the seen and unseen scars of battle. Today at 3pm, I will be observing - like all of you - a moment of silence to pay my respects to our heroes who are not with us, for those who have served, and for those who are currently serving in harms way. May God bless them and may God bless America.

[R-SC2]","  Home  About  Contact  Services  Media Center  Issues  Military/ Veterans  Resources  Recognizing our Servicemembers this Memorial Day       As your representative in Congress, advocating on behalf of those who have honorably served America is always one of my top priorities. This month marks Military Appreciation Month, a time when we remember, recognize, and honor all of our current and former servicemembers. As the son of a Flying Tiger of World War II and as a retiree from the U.S. Army Reserve and the South Carolina Army National Guard with four sons currently serving in the U.S. military, I am grateful for the service and sacrifice of all members of the Armed Forces and their families.  I was grateful to speak with USO representatives and servicemembers present at the recent USO event about our work in Congress to support our troops. Recently, I was especially privileged to greet World War II and Korean War veterans at the World War II Memorial in Washington. These men and women visited Washington as part of the South Carolina Honor Flight, an organization that brings veterans to see the national memorials built to honor their service. This event served as a good opportunity for me to hear from these veterans about their issues and priorities and talk with them about the ways Congress can help. These brave men and women served our nation valiantly during difficult times, and we are forever grateful for their service. I was especially honored to see my friend, Medal of Honor recipient Kyle Carpenter of Gilbert, who joined the veterans on their visit. You can view more photos from this remarkable event on my Facebook page here  .   I was honored to visit with over 60 veterans and discuss their concerns during the recent Honor Flight visit and greet Medal of Honor recipient, and constituent, Kyle Carpenter. While serving you in Washington, I work to help and protect America's veterans. Many veterans have experienced long wait times and inadequate care at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). When I visit Dorn VA Hospital in Columbia and the Charlie Norwood VA Hospital in Augusta, I see encouragement by the officials working there, yet challenges remain. An internal report from the Department of Veterans Affairs  revealed the department annually spends $6 billion on illegal contracts and out-of-control spending. This fraud is unacceptablean insult to the men and women who risked their lives in service to our country and an affront to the American taxpayer. Our veterans deserve the best care, and these questionable spending practices put them at risk as revealed by VA Committee Chairman Jeff Miller of Florida. Unfortunately, this lack of accountability is all too common under the current Administration. If you or someone you know is experiencing issues with the VA, please share your story  so that my office may be able to help.   Please share your VA Story with my office.  (Original Photo Source: House Republican Conference) My colleagues and I in the House of Representatives are committed to caring for our veterans and reforming the VA. Last week, we passed H.R. 1038, the Ensuring VA Employee Accountability Act, a bill to keep disciplinary records of VA employees in their file permanently. You can read about more VA reform bills passed earlier this Congress on my website.  Just as we support our veterans by reforming the VA, we also must support our veterans when they return home by expanding opportunities and creating new jobs. I am grateful that South Carolina has the highest percentage of veteran owned small businesses, and I will continue efforts to expand opportunity for small business growth and job creation. With the leadership of S.C. Adjutant General Bob Livingston, our National Guard veterans have one of the highest job placement rates in America. Last week, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 1382, the Boosting Rates of American Veteran Employment Act, and H.R. 1313, the Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Relief Act. These important pieces of legislation help our heroes after they return home by encouraging companies to hire qualified veterans and extending the veterans small business status to the surviving spouse. Please click this link to read more about my work to limit excessive government regulations and expand job creation to help all small businesses thrive  .   After visiting with South Carolina veterans about their priorities and what Congress can do to better serve them, I took a moment of silent reflection to thank all of our veterans at the World War II monument. This Memorial Day, we remember and honor those who have served this nation to protect and defend the freedoms we cherish. As we reflect on the heroism and devotion of the many brave service men and women who gave their lives in defense of our nation, we must never forget to thank and pray for their families and loved ones. Today, let us take the time to show our appreciation for the service and sacrifice of Americas heroes. As always, I appreciate your feedback.

They are part of what makes this country great, and we owe them and their families our gratitude and respect. We also honor our courageous men and women who today continue to serve, and who are making extreme personal sacrifices to keep our nation out of harm's way. Hoosiers have always answered the call of duty. Whether in Afghanistan or Iraq, the Persian Gulf, Vietnam, Korea, in the Pacific, Europe or North Africa  our state has sent its sons and daughters, and they have proudly represented our country. Many returned home to their families, and many too, gave their last full measure for the freedoms we enjoy each day. For those who have made the ultimate sacrifice, today is an opportunity for us to pay tribute. We also remember that for every absent soldier, sailor, airman and Marine, there are mothers and fathers, spouses and children, friends and colleagues who love them, miss them and keep alive their memory. While there will never be adequate means to thank our veteran members of the military for their bravery, or for their sacrifice, I will always support legislation that provides for our troops to accomplish their mission and to return home safely.  Rep. Carson talks with a veteran outside the Indiana War Memorial. I thank our men and women in uniform this Memorial Day, and throughout the year for protecting the liberties we cherish as a nation.

,114,Male,N00013799,43309,"Forbes, Randy (Rep.) [R-VA4]"," Send me an email | Forward to a Friend Bringing Mental Illness Out of the Shadows By Congressman Randy Forbes May 25, 2015 They have been called the walking wounded. They do not bear visible scars. They may, on the surface, participate in normal routines of everyday life. But the imprint of their trauma is there, hiding in the shadows. The mental wounds our military service members carry with them, though hidden from plain sight, are real. The ripple effect is strong. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, an estimated 1.3 million veterans received specialized mental health treatments from the VA for mental health related issues in 2011. Last year, CNN reported that, according to a Harvard Medical School study, The rate of major depression is five times as high among soldiers as civilians...and post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) nearly 15 times as high. Mental illness is both innately personal and profoundly national. This is not their issue -- it is our issue. The mental health of our military men and women creates a wake throughout our society that is directly connected to the health of our economy, our families, our military readiness, and our overall well-being as a nation. Mental illness is linked to unemployment: many young military veterans return home struggling to find work. Being out of work makes veterans more susceptible to depression; while for those diagnosed with mental illness, work can be harder to come by. Its a vicious cycle that has a snowball effect on those with mental illnesses, as well as our economy. Additionally, many military members place great value on remaining strong in the face of adversity, so it can be hard to admit to any illness, physical or mental. When left untreated, depression, post traumatic stress injuries, and even anxiety, can lead to sleep difficulties, obesity, chronic pain, or substance abuse. These associated illnesses take a toll on the VA medical system; mental and substance use disorders caused more hospitalizations among U.S. troops than any other cause in 2009. Behind the scenes, families also bear the pain of mental illness. In particular, for families who have lost a loved one to suicide, the mental costs of war are especially tough. Grieving family members symptoms can show up in the form of physical and mental health problems, perpetuating a cycle of mental health issues. There are a number of programs and resources available through the Department of Defense and the Department of Veterans Affairs. In fact, if you are a service member, veteran, or a family member of one, I encourage you to get screened and take advantage of the programs available: The Mental Health webpage at the Department of Veterans Affairs offers resources on programs, treatments, screening tools, and VA benefits and claims. The Real Warriors Campaign provides success stories from military service members who have received treatment and made recoveries from mental health issues. The Defense Centers of Excellence for Psychological Health and Traumatic Brain Injury provides information and resources about psychological health, post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), and traumatic brain injury. Maketheconnection.net connects veterans and service members with others who have had similar military experiences, whether facing similar deployments, coping with the death of a friend or family member, or transitioning from service. However, while a range of programs and resources exist, much remains to be done to ensure our military heroes have the resources they need to manage the stress that comes before, during, and after combat or deployment. Our government has a responsibility to do everything possible to equip them to succeed after serving their country. Recently, the House of Representatives voted for mental health services, suicide prevention activities, traumatic brain injury treatment, and homeless veterans treatment, services, and job training. At the end of the day, though, mental health is a conversation that requires involvement from our entire society. Despite existing resources, many veterans and others suffering from mental illness may choose not to take advantage of resources or programs, fearing that if their superiors, peers, or family members know about their emotional and mental difficulties, it may jeopardize their chances for promotion or damage relationships. The National Institute of Mental Health estimates 9.6 million adults in the United States  both servicmembers and civilians  suffer from serious mental illness (SMI); it is difficult to say how many of those millions are living in the shadows, their needs unspoken and unsupported. That is why one of the most crucial pieces of the mental health puzzle is to correct the stigma surrounding mental illness. May is Mental Health Awareness Month, a time to shed light on the very real challenges that people with mental illness, including our men and women in uniform, face. Additionally, this weekend is Memorial Day, when we commemorate the fallen, the warriors, the wounded, and those on the frontlines today. There is no better time than now to educate ourselves and show our support for our military heroes and all who battle mental illness. You can learn more about Mental Health Awareness Month and our military here. Mental illness is not just an issue that impacts a select few  it impacts all of us. Our government must be engaged, our communities must be engaged, and each of us as individuals must be engaged. It is within this context that our nation has an opportunity take mental illness out of the shadows and bring it into the light.

[D-OH]","Memorial Day Following the conclusion of the Civil War in 1865, Union veteran leaders established an annual Decoration Day to commemorate the fallen Union and Confederate soldiers. In the years since, Decoration Day has expanded to honor all fallen soldiers from every theater of war, and we now know it as Memorial Day. This Memorial day we honor the Ohioans who have laid down their lives for their country in every conflict from the War of 1812 through the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. We have a sacred duty to carry on their stories and preserve the memories of their heroism. To remember those who have served our nation in uniform and made the ultimate sacrifice for our country, the Ohio Western Reserve National Cemetery in Rittman will hold a ceremony on May 24 at 3:00 p.m., and on May 25 at 11:00 a.m. the Dayton National Cemetery will hold a ceremony. As we pause to remember those who have fought to preserve the rights we hold dear, we must also stand up for their survivors. U.S. Senator Sherrod Brown (D-OH) is committed to serving our nations military families and veterans. As we observe Memorial Day, the Library of Congress continues to seek submissions for its Veterans History Project, which collects, preserves, and presents the stories of American veterans for future generations. If you would like to learn more about the project, you may visit the projects website here. As the only Ohio Senator to serve a full term on the Senate Committee on Veterans Affairs, the welfare of Ohios military members and veterans is an important issue for Sen. Brown.

These heroes have given their lives so that the forces of terrorism cannot succeed, so that millions around the world can be liberated from tyranny and so that America remains a beacon of hope and freedom to the world.  On Memorial Day, as we honor the sacrifice of so many, we also recommit ourselves to the cause of liberty for which they fought. We express our heartfelt gratitude to the families who have lost a loved-one, who have given to this nation their fathers, mothers, brothers, sisters, husbands and wives, sons and daughters. In Georgia, our proud tradition of military service has meant that too many in our community have known the loss of a friend or family member who died in defense of our nation. Today we reach out our hand in fellowship, to comfort and to say thank you for all they and their loved ones have done for America.  We must always remember our fallen heroes and honor them by striving to build a nation worthy of their sacrifice. May we never take for granted the freedoms for which they fought and died.

Memorial Day has always been one of my favorite holidays, and I must admit that this year it holds a special significance. As a Member of Congress, I am often presented with meaningful opportunities in which I am able to recognize the courage and sacrifice of our brave men and women in uniform. However, recently I have had several unique chances to recognize and honor membersboth current and formerof our armed forces. Greater St. Louis Honor Flight Last week a group of St. Louisans visited Washington as part of the Greater St. Louis Honor Flight. For those who are unfamiliar, the Honor Flight program provides former members of the Armed Servicestypically World War II veteranswith the opportunity to visit Washington and view the Memorials dedicated to them and their brothers in arms. As often as I am able, I greet these brave men as they arrive at the World War II Memorial, which sits between the Washington Monument and the Lincoln Memorial. I was honored to do so on Tuesday, when 20 World War II veterans visited from St. Louis.   It is an absolute pleasure to greet the courageous men who stepped up to defend the free world in times of great uncertainty. It is always an awe-inspiring experience to greet these heroes and escort them as they take in the sights and view the memorialwhich is just a small token of our undying admiration for their courage and sacrifice. Greeting Honor Flights from Missouri is a truly humbling experience and one that words simply cannot do justice.  We thank these brave men for their service.  Captain Promotion Ceremony Youll have to excuse me if I am repeating myself, but as I am an extremely fortunate mom, I believe that some moments bear repeating. In early May, my oldest son Raymond was promoted to Captain in the U.S. Army. His service to our country has always been a great source of pride for me, but I must say that I found myself exceedingly proud of my Raymond as he had his Captain bars pinned onto his uniform just a few weeks ago.  The courage of young people like Raymond is a testament to our great nation, as well as the countless men and women who defend it. And so on this day, we pause, not only to enjoy perhaps an extra-long weekend with the family, but more importantly to thank the men and women who have served and to remember those who paid the ultimate sacrifice. The bible tells us that the greatest gift that one can give is to lay down your life for your friends. It would be an unimaginable injustice for us to let this occasion pass without pausing to remember all those who have given so much. Without their selfless service to our country, we would not enjoy the vast freedom that we sometimes take for granted. Enjoy this day with your friends and family, but please remember to say a prayer for those who have fought and those who have died in defense of our nation. God bless the United States of America, and God bless our veterans.

[R-TX]","May 22, 2015 Greetings, As we approach Memorial Day, let us never forget the sacrifice of those who shed their blood so that we might remain free. This Monday, scattered petals throughout the land remind us of liberty born anew because of their sacrifice. I encourage you to take a moment to reflect on this incredible gift of freedom, and to remember all those weve lost in battles to preserve it. Keep Texas strong, Ted Cruz  Sen. Cruz Receives Bipartisan Support for NDAA Amendments Last week, Sen. Cruz applauded the passage of the FY 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) by the Senate Armed Services Committee (SASC). He introduced or cosponsored more than a dozen amendments that were successfully adopted by the committee. Congress' first priority is to provide for the national defense and ensure our soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines have everything they need to defend our freedom, said Sen. Cruz. I am grateful for the committee's support for my amendments, including measures that will ensure the readiness of our troops, support for our allies, and continued vigilance against our adversaries. This bipartisan legislation reflects the dedication this committee has to our men and women in uniform. I am honored to have worked with my colleagues to achieve the important reforms in this legislation and look forward to its consideration on the Senate floor. There are certainly provisions that I believe can be improved further to guarantee we have the best trained and equipped military in the world. The amendments Sen. Cruz sponsored include the following. View the full list here. Renewable Energy Obstructions near Military Installations helps each branch of the military obtain more direct input into the decisions of the Department of Defense (DoD) Siting Clearinghouse during its assessment of renewable energy projects near military facilities. National Guard Full Time Operational Status modifications will improve the efficiency of the National Guard by requiring the National Guard Bureau to account for states that over-recruit to meet the National Guard's overall end strength. The National Guard routinely asks Texas to recruit beyond designated levels; and Texans unequivocally answer that call. Iranian Cyber Capabilities Reporting expands the existing Annual Report on the Military Power of Iran to include an assessment on Iran's rapidly developing offensive and defensive cyber warfare capabilities. Space-Based Missile Defense requests an assessment from the Missile Defense Agency on the research and development of a space-based missile defense capability and its potential role in the layered ballistic missile defense system the U.S. currently possesses. A space-based component is critical to pursue given the increasing global threat environment. This capability would provide additional engagement time and intercept opportunities for the U.S. and better protect the American people, our allies, and our forward-deployed forces. Sen. Cruz Delivers Statement on Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act Click to view video On Wednesday, Sen. Cruz delivered the following statement at an executive session of the Senate Commerce Committee. The Cruz-Nelson-Peters Commercial Space Launch Competitiveness Act was reported out of committee for consideration by the full U.S. Senate. Today we build upon the Commercial Space Launch Act that was first signed into law by President Ronald Reagan in 1984 and last amended in 2004, said Sen. Cruz. Since becoming the Chairman of the Space, Science, and Competitiveness subcommittee I have made it a priority to carry forth President Reagans vision of producing a stronger and more efficient launch capability for the United States that will contribute to continued American leadership in space. Thanks to the leadership and bipartisan support of Ranking Member Nelson, Ranking Member Peters, Senator Rubio and Senator Gardner we have produced a bill for this committees consideration and that was just adopted by this committee that all of us can be proud of, and that has received support from 20 organizations in the space industry. Our legislation reflects the needs of a changing and growing industry and aims to encourage the competitiveness of the U.S. commercial space industry while recognizing the vital role the private sector plays along with NASA. I commend the committee and I commend the Chairman for this bipartisan legislation moving forward. The bill extends the International Space Station (ISS) until 2024 and ensures stability for the continued development and growth of the U.S. commercial space sector. View more details here.  Sen. Cruz Sends Letter to Defense Secretary Requesting Information about Iran On Friday, Sen. Cruz, joined by Sens. Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and David Perdue (R-Ga.), sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of Defense Ashton Carter expressing strong concern over the ongoing publication delay of the Defense Departments Annual Report on the Military Power of Iran. In the context of the ongoing P5+1 negotiations with the Islamic Republic of Iran over that nations nuclear program and its potential military dimensions, we believe it is imperative that this report be published as quickly as possible, the senators wrote. We are concerned that the negotiations fail to recognize the inherent dangers of a nuclear Iran, particularly given the regimes repeated genocidal threats against America and our close ally Israel. Read the full letter here.  A Regional Update fromSouth Central Texas Regional Director Michael Koerner This week, I had the opportunity to travel throughout the region. In San Antonio, I had the distinct honor of presenting a letter from Sen. Cruz to a Central Catholic High School student congratulating him on his recent appointment to the U. S. Military Academy at West Point. While in the city, I was also pleased to serve as a judge for the San Antonio Tea Party's first annual Constitutional Scholarship. Then, I headed to Corpus Christi to continue our monthly mobile outreach efforts and met with local officials and leaders in the community. And the final stop was El Paso, where I attended the Borderplex Trade Alliance and City of El Paso's sister city signing ceremonythis is an opportunity for the city of El Paso to partner with the city of Hadera, Israel in an effort to promote global investment and cultural exchange programs.

Dear Friend, Memorial Day is a time to honor all of those who have given their lives in defense of this country. It reminds us of how lucky we are to live free in a land of democracy and opportunity. It also reminds us that this freedom has come at an extraordinarily cost. Throughout our nation's history, countless men and women have made incredible sacrifices to protect our freedoms. Millions have lost their lives defending the flag of the United States of America. Nothing we do on Memorial Day will bring back the lives of those who perished fighting for this country. There is no way to fully heal the heartache of families torn apart by the sacrifices of brave soldiers. But we must recognize that what we owe to these men and women extends well beyond the bounds of any holiday. This Memorial Day, we remember all of those who have made the ultimate sacrifice to ensure the United States of America will endure as the greatest nation the world has ever known. Please join me in thanking our current troops for their courage and selflessness, and please say a prayer for all of those still in harm's way.

[R-PA15]","Dear Friend: Today we honor those of our fellow Americans who sacrificed their lives to preserve our nation while serving in the Armed Forces. They are the reason why you and I and our families can enjoy the peace of this lovely day. When the times were dark, the path ahead dangerous, they gave their last full measure for their fellow soldiers, for their families and for their fellow Americans. As Chairman of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee I am devoted to making sure our veterans and their families have all the resources they need  not only when theyre deployed, but also when they come home. Recently, the House took action to ensure that our veterans and military families have the necessary resources and support they need by passing my bipartisan bill to provide an unprecedented level of funding for veterans care and military construction projects The bill increased veterans funding by $3.6 billion (5.6%) above last years level, and is an increase of over $15 billion in funding since 2010 It provided an additional $3.8 billion for veterans medical care that will allow for about 7 million patients to receive healthcare through the VA. It also focused on providing means to reduce the backlog of veterans claims and appeals awaiting action. My bill took steps to increase oversight and accountability in the VA through actions including: Taking away funding for unwarranted VA executive bonuses Cutting funding for poorly performing offices Providing additional funding to the VA Office of Inspector General Establishing strike force response teams to bring in experienced, high-performing managers to implement corrective administrative actions at low-performing facilities In order to ensure that future generations continue to have the opportunity to remember and pay tribute to our nations brave heroes, my bill also increased funding for Arlington National Cemetery and the American Battle Monuments Commission so that those memorials may continue to endure Our veterans and military families have given so much to our nation, and we owe them the very best we can provide. While we honor the fallen this Memorial Day, lets make sure we also take time to thank our veterans and active duty service members who defend our freedoms not just today but every day The debt we owe to those who lost their lives defending America cannot be repaid. We can only offer our reverence, remembrance and our determination to meet the needs of their brothers and sisters in uniform.

The bill, which passed the Senate 98 to 1 and the House of Representatives 400 to 25, requires congressional review of any final nuclear agreement with Iran before the president can waive sanctions imposed by Congress. After more than a year of bipartisan work and a veto threat from the White House, I am pleased to see this bill become law so that any final nuclear agreement with Iran will have to go through Congress where the American people will have a say and lawmakers will have a vote, *said Corker.* I appreciate the strong bipartisan support for this effort that demonstrates Congresss determination to prevent Iran from getting a nuclear weapon. With the role of Congress now guaranteed, the administration must address the many significant concerns raised by Congress, and our negotiators should take advantage of the added leverage to force further concessions from the Iranians so that any agreement reached is verifiable, enforceable and can assure the American people Iran will not be able to develop a nuclear weapon. Read more about the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 *here [link 1]*. *First Steps in Reforming Our Financial System* Senator Corker, a member of the Senate Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs Committee, released the following statement after voting in favor of the Financial Regulatory Improvement Act of 2015. The bill passed the committee by a vote of 12 to 10. I am pleased the banking committee has taken the first step in reforming our financial system and reducing the overwhelming regulatory burden facing community banks today, *said Corker. *It is my hope that we will reach a bipartisan consensus before this legislation is considered by the full Senate that will give hardworking Americans access to credit while protecting taxpayers from another financial crisis, and I stand ready to work with colleagues on both sides of the aisle who are willing to make modifications that will produce a bill that can be signed into law. The legislation includes three housing finance provisions long championed by Corker. I want to thank Chairman Shelby for including several very important housing finance provisions in this legislation, *added Corker.* There is bipartisan, bicameral consensus that the fate of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac should be determined by Congress, and Title VII of this bill reaffirms that the ball is in Congresss court to decide the future of our housing finance system and put an end to the terrible practice of using g-fees to pay for other government spending. While I still would like to see this committee tackle comprehensive housing finance reform, if that is not an option in the near term, some of these provisions will help.

Earlier this year, Corker appointed Clark to the United States Senate Page Program, where he plays an important role in the day-to-day operations of the Senate. I have had the opportunity to get to know Hampton over the past few months through his work as a Senate Page and could not be more impressed, *said Corker. *He has distinguished himself through his service both in Troop 191 on Lookout Mountain and as a Senate Page here in Washington, and it was an absolute honor to present him with his Eagle Scout badge today. With young people like Hampton taking an interest in public service so early in life, I have no doubt that our community, state, and nations future is bright. I thank him for the example he is setting and wish him all the best in the future. As a Senate Page, Clarks duties consist primarily of the delivery of correspondence and legislative materials within the U.S. Capitol and Senate office buildings, assisting senators on the Senate floor, and preparing the Senate Chamber before the start of each session. The highly selective program allows students a unique opportunity to learn about government while continuing their coursework. *Travels Across Tennessee* On Friday, May 15, Corker visited St. Jude Childrens Research Hospital, where he met with a patient and family from Tennessee receiving treatment at the hospital. On a tour led by St. Jude president and chief executive officer Dr. James R. Downing and chair of the department of radiation oncology Dr. Thomas E. Merchant, Corker also visited the new St. Jude Red Frog Events Proton Therapy Center, which will provide the latest advancements in radiation therapy to childhood cancer patients within the year. ""As a parent, there is nothing you want more for your child than good health and the opportunity for them to live life to its fullest,"" *said Corker. *""The advancements made by St. Jude Children's Research Hospital to treat and find a cure for cancer are felt around the world. I was honored to tour their facilities today and see firsthand the incredible work being done each day to help children and their families win the battle against this horrible disease.""

On Monday, May 18, joined Senator Alexander in hosting a roundtable discussion in Knoxville on the Tennessee Valley Authoritys (TVA) long-term plan to meet future electricity demand while consistently offering low-cost, competitive power rates capable of driving economic development and job growth in the Tennessee Valley. Nothing is more important to me than Tennesseans standard of living and our states ability to attract high-quality jobs, and TVA's ability to carry out its mission of providing low-cost, reliable power directly impacts that, *said Corker.* Our discussion today focused on ensuring TVA is operating in the best interest of ratepayers and hardworking Tennesseans and is not swayed by outside influence to over-invest in power sources like wind and solar that do not make sense in Tennessee. Corker joined Senator Alexander in questioning panel participants, which included Bill Johnson, president and CEO of the Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA); Wayne Henson, chairman of the Board of Directors of the Tennessee Valley Public Power Association (TVPPA); and Lloyd Webb, Director of Energy Procurement at Olin Chlor Alkali and representative of the Tennessee Valley Industrial Committee (TVIC).

As citizens from the District of Columbia continue to fight for freedom around the world, the best way for our country to honor their service would be to give them a vote in the very chambers that decide whether they go to war and control of their local affairs. D.C. members of the armed forces and our veterans have earned statehood. Upcoming Event: Small Business Fair, Wednesday, June 10 [SBF Flier Newsletter] On Wednesday, June 10, 2015, we are hosting our annual Small Business Fair for District of Columbia businesses and residents to learn everything they need to know about starting, developing and growing a small business here. Throughout the day there will be workshops available providing guidance on writing a small business plan, winning a federal contract, securing a D.C. contract, insuring a small business, securing tax credits that are available through the Affordable Care Act, understanding the E-Verify program, and many other services. Participants will also receive one-on-one advice and counseling from bank loan officers, government small business procurement specialists, and SBA specialists on a range of best business practices. D.C. residents and business owners interested in participating should register by Friday, May 29. To register, CLICK HERE. D.C. Students Can Visit the Capitol and Sit on the House Floor For D.C. adult groups and students, one of the most rewarding experiences is sitting on the floor of the U.S. House of Representative, which can be done only during hours or on days when the House is not in session and only in the company of a Member. This is the House floor where I argue to defend the District and to get benefits for the city. District groups and students need and deserve this experience. During the visits, I explain the highlights of floor proceedings and groups get to see D.C.s own Frederick Douglass statue and other sites of special interest to D.C. This week, I am hosting students from John Carroll Nalle Elementary School, Anacostia High School, and Options Charter School. Adult groups and schools interested in going on the House floor and touring special sites in the Capitol should contact my district office by calling 202-408-9041. Getting Sledding Back on Capitol Hill After District families were threatened with the loss of sledding on Capitol Hill, I worked to ensure that the U.S. Capitol Police would not enforce a 19th century law prohibiting sledding on Capitol Grounds. I worked with Representative Sam Farr (D-CA), a good friend who is always there for the District, who got his fellow appropriators to pass a commonsense provision, which also passed the full House of Representatives last week. Now, I am working to get the Senate to follow suit and ensure that our kids have a ball on Americas front lawn next snowfall! Sticking Up for a D.C. Resident Who Was Arrested at a Congressional Hearing Last week, I wrote U.S. Capitol Police (USCP) Chief Kim Dine requesting clarification on USCPs policy on removing demonstrators from House and Senate committee hearings and business meetings (markups), after a District of Columbia resident was forcibly removed from a House Oversight and Government Reform Committee hearing to overturn a D.C. law on April 21, despite witness accounts that the resident was not demonstrating. I fully understand that the Capitol Police must maintain order and decorum, but they also must make sure that practice matches policy, and that D.C. residents and other American citizens are not wrongfully silenced or arrested. I have requested a response from Chief Dine within 30 days.

,114,Male,N00009829,43349,"McDermott, Jim (Rep.) [D-WA7]","Dear Friends, Just two months before the first ever Memorial Day was observed in 1865, President Lincoln concluded his celebrated Second Inaugural Address with a call for national reconciliation and healing: Let us strive on to finish the work we are in, to bind up the nations wounds, to care for him who shall have borne the battle and for his widow and his orphan, to do all which may achieve and cherish a just and lasting peace among ourselves and with all nations. It was a sentiment a traumatized nation needed to hear after a long war, and what those who had seen and fought it so deserved. These days it seems hard to tell whether its peace time or war time. The so-called War on Terror, the post-9/11 wars taken together, is not only the longest war in American history, but also the one that has seemingly morphed into a perpetual war. Not five years after the last American troops left Iraq, we are again hearing calls to send them back. It is an admirable and quintessential American quality to see conflict in the world and desire to end it. But we cannot possibly contemplate starting the next war when we as a society still havent grappled with the consequences and the true costs of the last one. This is not about candidates or elections. This is about understanding the burden our military has borne the past 14 years, and what we as Americans must acknowledge: we are all responsible for the wounds, psychological and physical, that our soldiers have endured. And beyond the scars they carry from the battlefield, at home they continue to face high rates of suicide, unemployment, homelessness, alcoholism, substance abuse and post-traumatic stress. It is our collective duty to receive our warriors home, to listen to their stories, and to help navigate their path to reconciliation and reintegration into our communities. Our society is transfixed by nebulous and chilling threats we see emanating from the most troubled parts of the world. Yet we have not fully assessed the trauma we as a nation sustained after 14 years of conflict, least of all the trauma our servicemembers continue to battle. The further removed we become from the major combat operations of the past decade, the more the sacrifices our servicemen and women, and their families, threaten to fade from our memory. And it is that void that threatens their long-deserved transition to peace. Im reminded of what Martin Luther King, Jr. said in his Nobel Peace Prize acceptance speech: We will not build a peaceful world by following a negative path. It is not enough to say, We must not wage war. It is necessary to love peace and sacrifice for it. We must concentrate not merely on the negative expulsion of war, but on the positive affirmation of peace. This Memorial Day, lets reflect on what this long war has cost us as a nation, and what perpetual war will cost our warriors and their families, who have selflessly borne the brunt of hardship these past many years. We should not endeavor to seek a forever war, but as Americans, affirm our pursuit of a just and lasting peace.

[R-NM2]","Congressman Steve Pearce, Representing the 2nd District of New Mexico CONGRESSMAN PEARCE:MEMORIAL DAY IS A TIME FOR REMEMBRANCE AND GRATITUDE [image = day 2 2015.jpg] Today, we meet to honor the memory of countless brave young Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom. They fought courageously at battles waged in places like St. Mihiel, Chateau-Thierry, the Ardennes Forest, Normandy, Midway, Saipan, Iwo Jima, Okinawa, Pusan, Inchon, Khe Sanh, Hue City, Khafji, Kabul, and Baghdad. Some were captured, never to return. Others remain Missing in Action. Across our country in cemeteries, parks, town squares and at monuments, we honor all those fallen heroes -- men and women  known and unknown  who answered the call to defend and protect the worlds greatest and longest-recorded experiment in freedom. Many were like us  New Mexicans  who hailed from cities, small towns, farms and ranches. We know by their example that freedom is not free. Our freedom was purchased at a great price. These men and women, who have gone before us, laid down their hopes and dreams so that we could live freely, and, without fear of annihilation. They passed down to us the liberty that they themselves inherited, with our exceptional and sought-after way of life. In tribute and deep gratitude to our fallen warriors, let us not forget that they fought and died so that the America they loved could continue to be a beacon of freedom for the entire world. The good news is that they were ultimately successful. Thanks to their selfless acts, we can celebrate the victory of freedom over tyranny and oppression. Whether you will celebrate Memorial Day at a barbeque, parade, picnic, or simply by catching up on time with family and friends, I encourage everyone to take a moment to remember our fallen heroes. Let us also recall and pray for their families and friends, who waited for their return and who today recount their loss. May we never forget them or their immense sacrifice. And may God continue to bless our nation with men and women who will always answer the call.

[In advance of the Memorial Day holiday, House Republicans again this week turned our attention to helping our nation's veterans. On Monday the House passed six bills [aimed at helping veterans including bills to make it easier for disabled veterans to start businesses and legislation to give preference in contracting to those who have served our nation. Another Bipartisan Bill Sent to President's Desk The new Congress continued its productive, bipartisan work this week as the House passed S. 178, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015. This bill includes a number of measures to combat one of the most heinous crimes imaginable, the trafficking of humans. Among the measures are increased funding for victims to receive counseling and increased punishments for the criminals who commit these heinous crimes. Human trafficking has become the crime of choice for many criminal enterprises and it must be stopped. I look forward to President Obama signing this important bill [into law so we can do just that. Last year I spoke on the House floor about the horrors of human trafficking. Click the image below to see video of my remarks. [Proud to Support Throughout our history, America has been a world leader when it comes to innovation. Across a variety of fields and industries, we have made strategic investments to solve many of the most difficult issues facing society. This week, the House took a step to ensure that continues by passing H.R. 880, the American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015 [I was proud to support this bill which makes permanent the research and development tax credit. By making this tax credit permanent, we can make sure that American individuals and businesses continue to invest and innovate.

In an effort to honor those who served, I recently introduced a bill to create a commemorative coin to honor Silvis' Hero Street community. Less than two blocks in length, Hero Street has been home to over 100 service members since the start of World War II, a concentration higher than any other street of comparable size in the country. It is because of the sacrifices made by families like those who have called Hero Street home and the brave young service members from Hero Street who put their lives on the line for us that the American Dream is still alive today. This effort to give national recognition to these heroes would also benefit the veterans of today, as sales of this commemorative coin will benefit the Wounded Warrior Project. It is impossible to appropriately thank those service members who made the ultimate sacrifice for their nation-their gift is too great for gratitude. But we can start by taking care of their brothers and sisters in arms who are still with us today. >From the bottom of my heart, thank you for all that you have done for our country.

While we can never truly repay our debt to those who gave their lives for us, we must not forget what we owe to those who have returned home. We have an obligation to ensure veterans have access to the highest quality healthcare, education, and employment opportunities available. Just as the military pledges to leave no soldier behind on the battlefield, we will leave no veteran behind when they return home. America has a sacred trust with the men and women who have served our country in uniform and we are dedicated to doing all we can to guarantee our veterans have access to timely, quality health care. We are making every effort to modernize the VA healthcare system and ensure there are available facilities in close proximity. Just last year Congress passed the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act which established the Choice Card program to allow eligible veterans to receive care from private, non-VA health facilities. Our VA facility under construction in New Orleans is on track for a 2016 opening and will have the capacity to service 70,000 veterans with the best possible care. I will continue to support and hold the VA accountable to delivering on their commitments. Education is the cornerstone to enabling our nations veterans to find a good paying job once they return home. According to VA data, 1.4 million veterans or eligible military family members have been able to continue their education thanks to the Post-9/11 GI Bill. Service members are provided a tuition and fee payment to their school on their behalf as well as a monthly housing allowance so that they can attend top level colleges and universities funds can also be used for trade schools, on-the-job training, apprenticeships, and flight schools for those who choose to pursue those routes. After fighting for our nation overseas, no veteran should have to fight for a job at home. Congress along with the President have taken steps to help our men and women in uniform find good-paying jobs from providing tax credits for businesses that hire veterans to creating a Veterans Job Corp that helps veterans find pathways to work protecting and rebuilding America. Recent jobs reports show veterans are making progress in our economy but there is more work to be done. Recently, the VA launched the Veterans Economic Communities Initiative an enterprise to improve education, training and employment opportunities for veterans in public and private organizations. We have over 350,000 veterans in Louisiana and over 44,000 in the 2nd District who served our country with honor and valor. We honor them as a celebration of their lives and a reminder of the true cost of the freedoms we enjoy today. As we join our fellow Americans to remember those who have made the ultimate sacrifice and salute those who have served our country around the world, understand we will stop at nothing to provide the quality of life deserving of those who defend our way of life.

With two WWII veterans visiting the Navy Memorial Combating Human Trafficking Last week, the House passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, (S.178), a comprehensive piece of legislation which will go a long way in combating human trafficking in the United States. Included in the legislation, which now heads to the President's desk to be signed into law, is the language of the Human Trafficking Detection Act of 2015 (H.R. 460), which I introduced with my colleague Congressman Mark Walker (R-NC). We have a moral obligation to do everything in our power to end modern day slavery, and this bill is an important step.

For me, this solemn moment will be spent contemplating the noble sacrifices of more than a million brave soldiers, whose last moments on earth were selflessly spent as a guardian of freedom and protector of our American way of life. God alone knows the ripples in history their ultimate sacrifices will cause. This Memorial Day has special significance, because this year we mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II, as well as the 40th anniversary of the tragic fall of Saigon at the end of the Vietnam War. These anniversaries cause us to reflect more deeply on the sacrifices of those who gave all. Such sacrifices are noble, but painful for those who spend this holiday thumbing through photographs of a son or a daughter who never came home, or a father they never got to know. Families of the fallen continue to give, when everyday a memory of their loved one crosses their mind. There is solace in knowing that there is no greater love than to lay down ones life for ones friends, and that the cause for which they died will live on for as long as humanity dreams of freedom.  Sincerely, [image = Keith *A Tribute To Veterans*: I was privileged to meet and congratulate the Chairmans Award Winner, Staff Sergeant Gary Radford of the North Hills at the Veterans Leadership Programs annual Tribute to Veterans. This recipient of the Silver Star, two Bronze Stars (one with Valor), two Purple Hearts, as well as numerous other military honors, returned to northern Vietnam 26 years after the wars end to search for the remains of two men from his platoon. Staff Sergeant Radford is a man who embodies a US soldiers creed to never quit and to leave no fallen comrade behind. It was an honor to be able to attend this event and help recognize of one of Americas best.  [image =  *A Dangerous Nexus: Terrorism, Crime, and Corruption*: In her testimony last week during a hearing held by the Financial Services Committees Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing, Professor Celina Realuyo smartly pointed out that money serves as the oxygen for global terror activities. During the hearing, I raised the issue of Iran as a source of that money. As the most active state-sponsor of terror, Iran acts as a central bank for global extremist groups around the world. Through its financial and military support of groups like Hezbollah, Hamas, the Houthi rebels, and militant groups in Afghanistan, Iran is responsible for the deaths of hundreds of American service members and innocent civilians. I questioned the witnesses on the panel about President Obamas decision to lift sanctions on Iran as part of his nuclear negotiations. The witnesses agreed that any lifting of sanctions will provide Iran billions of more dollars and allow them to better fund terror around the world.

This means we are one step closer to seeing my common-sense, bipartisan legislation to reinstate the annual open-enrollment period for Medicare Advantage plans implemented. Allowing seniors to test-drive their coverage is a simple way we can ensure seniors have access to the doctors and services they need, and change plans if they determine theirs is not working for them. I am optimistic that we will get these reforms passed soon to improve the Medicare Advantage program for the sixteen million seniors who depend on it.  *Celebrating Resilient Foster Children and Foster Families:* Pennsylvania has about 15,000 children in foster care each year. This means we have thousands of families throughout our communities, with hearts big enough to provide love and care for children in need of a place to call home. It takes a special kind of caregiver to foster a child, someone who can drop everything on a moment's notice and be there for a child who has experienced neglect or abuse, and been removed from the home. In honor of May being National Foster Care Month, I spoke on the House floor [link 4]to celebrate the resiliency of foster children, who are able to overcome great obstacles, and the foster families who support them.  [image = [link 5]  *Leg Affairs: * For over two hundred and fifty years, Western Pennsylvania has been a major hub of innovation and a great pioneer of American industry. This week, the House approved a number of bills that will encourage businesses of all sizes in our Commonwealth to develop new products here in America which will result in more jobs, increased wages, and grow the economy. On Wednesday, the House passed H.R. 1806 [link 6], the *America COMPETES Act***,** which authorizes funding for specified research and education programs and grants. This bill will supports the work of over 356,500 scientists, engineers, and students and will provide businesses and workers tools to compete in the 21st century economy. The House also passed H.R. 880 [link 7], the *American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015***, **which makes the research and development tax credit permanent to provide people stability they need to invest in new research and technology. Finally, on Thursday, the House passed H.R. 2262 [link 8], the *SPACE Act of 2015***, **whichfacilitates a pro-growth environment for the developing commercial space industry. It encourages private sector investment and creates more stable and predictable regulatory conditions to keep American space companies internationally competitive. *Dont Forget To Come Out For A Conversation And An Ice Cream Cone*: [image = ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- [link 1] [link 2] [link 3] [link 4] [link 5] [link 6] [link 7] [link 8] Office Locations Washington, D.C.

As Americans, we can never repay the debt we owe to those who laid down their lives on behalf of our country - and to their families. But, we can remember them and try to live our lives in a way that honors their tremendous sacrifice. With all the distractions that a holiday weekend can bring, let's be sure to take time this Memorial Day to reflect on our fallen heroes. And I hope you'll join me in making sure our children know what this day truly means and why show our respect and gratitude. As we pay tribute to those who have fallen in combat, let us not also forget those who continue to serve on our behalf, as well as our veterans. I want to take a moment to share with you the story of one truly incredible veteran and how he came to receive the Congressional Gold Medal. More than 60,000 fighter pilots have served in the U.S. Armed Forces through the years. Among them, only 1,447 have earned the designation of ""Fighter Ace,"" a merit given to those who downed five or more enemy aircraft in combat. Only 77 remain alive today, and one of them, Lieutenant General Charles ""Chick"" Cleveland  , lives here in Central Alabama.  Gen. Cleveland, who lives in Montgomery, actually serves as President of the American Fighter Aces. It was my distinct honor this past week to visit with him and his son, Chris, who were in Washington, D.C. for the Congressional Gold Medal Ceremony. Gen. Cleveland and his fellow Aces received the Medal for their extraordinary acts of bravery on behalf of our country. The Congressional Gold Medal is the highest honor Congress can bestow, awarded to Americans who have made special contributions to the United States. None are more deserving recipients than those who have so valiantly fought for our nation.  Before the ceremony, Gen. Cleveland was kind enough to sit down with my staff and me to visit and share his stories about how he earned the title ""Ace""  during the Korean War. It was awe-inspiring to hear his stories, including what it was like to dogfight with enemy jets in the dangerous region known as ""MiG Alley."" After Korea, Gen. Cleveland went on to a distinguished and decorated career as an aviator and combat instructor. He later served as a commander of Air University at Maxwell Air Force Base from 1980-1984. Gen. Cleveland then retired to Montgomery but remained active in Air Force affairs, both nationally and locally at Maxwell.  In all, some three dozen of the surviving Fighter Aces were on hand for the ceremony where Gen. Cleveland accepted the award on the group's behalf. These men have been the ""tip of the spear"" for our Armed Forces, using their unique skill and dauntless courage to take the fight to the enemy, shorten wars and save lives. The General is an American hero, but he's also Montgomery's hero  . His command at Maxwell and continued support over the years make him an important part of our community, and I was proud to join in celebrating this moment with him and his son.

[D-NM1]","News from Congresswoman Lujan Grisham  Monday, May 25, 2015 Memorial Day Dear Friends, Each year on Memorial Day we come together as a nation to remember the men and women who have made the ultimate sacrifice in service to our nation. Since 2001, more than 2.7 million service members have been deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq alone, including nearly 17,000 New Mexicans. As the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan have drawn down, more than 2 million veterans have enrolled in the VA health care system. This influx of veterans seeking VA medical care from a flawed system, fraught with accountability issues, resulted in unnecessary and preventable wait times, delayed care for many. Thats why I have dedicated myself to ensuring that veterans in New Mexico are receiving the very best care possible. My office has served hundreds of veterans in the last year alone by providing assistance when they have struggled to receive their benefits or have been treated poorly by the VA system. I also hosted a workshop in March that attracted more than 200 veterans or their family members who came to get assistance with their cases. Some were concerned about the quality of care they were receiving; others were having problems getting access to care, or they could not secure benefits. We created a one-stop shop to help veterans get their issues resolved. While the workshop was helpful, and weve taken steps in Congress to reform the VA system, its clear there are still issues that need to be addressed. We must renew our commitment to veterans across the country, as well as to reservists and their families. We have an obligation to ensure they receive the high-quality care and benefits they have earned and deserve in a timely and accurate manner. To that end, we must continue to strengthen and expand quality health care for veterans, modernize the Department of Veterans Affairs for the 21st century, and foster new education, training and employment opportunities for returning Iraq and Afghanistan service members. Just as the military pledges to leave no soldier behind on the battlefield, we will leave no veteran behind when they return home. As always, if I can be of any assistance, please do not hesitate to contact my Washington, D.C. or Albuquerque offices. Sincerely, Michelle Lujan Grisham Member of Congress P.S.

And we do this because remembering is so vitally important to healing. That ever so slowly, over time as we remember, we eventually and hopefully can remember the sacrifice without feeling the pain. Memorial Day is for the families who will always have an empty space at their dinner tables and in their hearts, and its for the children who grow up knowing their mom or dad died a hero. Its for moms and dads, sons and daughters, and aunts and uncles. Its for brothers and sisters who have experienced the bitter chill of such a loss. Its really for all of us. Click above to watch my Memorial Day message.  My father served in World War II in the Marines, and I am so grateful that he made it home to his family. Unfortunately, not everyone is that blessed. Since I have been in Congress, five young men from our Congressional district have died while serving, and five families have become gold star families. Photos of Corporal Justin Ross, Sergeant Paul Atim, Staff Sergeant Matthew Hermanson, Staff Sergeant Garrick Eppinger, and Staff Sergeant Jordan Bear hang outside my office for everyone to see, and the world is a safer place for their sacrifice. Thank you to those who are serving, to the families of those who are laying their lives on the line, and especially to the loved ones of those who have paid the ultimate price.

,114,Male,N00032029,43583,"Griffith, Morgan (Rep.) [R-VA9]","John Wilkes, Rand Paul, and Mike Lee I noted with interest last week that Senator Rand Paul (R-KY) took to the Senate floor to talk against the Patriot Act provisions that allow the National Security Agency (NSA) to gather data on all Americans. As you know, I feel this is a violation of the United States Constitutional provisions against unlawful search. I have spoken previously about that in this column, and referenced John Wilkes. As you may recall, John Wilkes is a character from English history who thought George III was a bad King, and put it in writing. The King did not appreciate that sentiment, and because Wilkes was writing anonymously, the Kings minions ordered a general search of East London. The people found this revolting, and historians would later call the movement the ""Wilkesite Rebellion."" In his more than 10 hour discussion, Senator Paul also reminded people that it was in fact the Wilkesite Rebellion and his close contacts with the Sons of Liberty that ultimately led to the Founding Fathers recognizing in the Bill of Rights that law abiding citizens have the freedom of speech and freedom against ""general warrant"" searches. Joining Senator Paul was Senator Mike Lee (R-UT), who also brought up John Wilkes. Nearly 250 years later, I am glad the actions of one brave man standing up against tyranny are still echoing liberty in the halls of the United States Congress. Unanimous  21st Century Cures Initiative As you may recall, my colleagues and I on the Energy and Commerce Committee have been working for the last year on the bipartisan 21st Century Cures initiative. Launched by Chairman Fred Upton (R-MI) and Congresswoman Diana DeGette (D-CO), this effort is about saving more lives, keeping this country the leader in medical innovation, and accelerating the discovery, development, and delivery cycle of new cures and treatments for diseases. Since the launch of this initiative in May of 2014, we have invited medical experts and patient advocates to share with us their perspective on how to best accelerate the pace of cures by participating in hearings in Washington or roundtable discussions throughout the nation. I attended those hearings in Washington, and held a regional 21st Century Cures roundtable discussion in Blacksburg with Congressman Phil Roe, M.D. (R-TN) and a number of medical experts. These efforts resulted in the 21st Century Cures Act (H.R. 6), which passed the Energy and Commerce Committee unanimously in a vote of 51-0 on Thursday, May 21. This package is an important step forward in terms of modernizing and personalizing health care, encouraging research and innovation, and streamlining the system, and a significant stride closer to new cures, treatments, and hope for patients. Annual Coal Conference On Monday, May 18, I joined Congressman Roe and others at the Virginia Coal and Energy Alliance's annual conference at which, among other things, the Obama Administrations so-called Clean Power Plan was discussed. Regular readers of this column are familiar with my strong opposition to this plan, as it threatens our Constitution, jobs, and affordable, reliable energy. When government picks winners and losers, everybody loses, Congressman Roe stated at the conference. Ive driven up through Eastern Kentucky (coalfields) and what they have created is a wasteland ... When you take the business of coal away, you take away the car dealership, the donations to the Little League, how you pay for your schools ... The young people leave and go somewhere else and never come back. To reiterate my remarks at the conference, with the Administrations proposed Clean Power Plan here in the United States, other parts of the world look very inviting for those seeking to build new facilities and create jobs. Sadly, what we have at this Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is a small group of ideologues who seemingly do not care about jobs, a reliable all-of-the-above energy portfolio, or the Constitution of the United States. They are embedded in the EPA's bureaucracy, and they seem to hire those who agree with them. Further, I would submit to you that they are working to do away with carbon-based fuels, which is not practical in a world economy. Dominion Resources Public Policy Manager William Murray, who has served then-Governors Tim Kaine (D-VA) and Mark Warner (D-VA), said, We cannot have an all-natural-gas future or an all-anything future. We've got to have coal as the backbone of electric power generation. I agree. If you have questions, concerns, or comments, feel free to contact my office.

[R-WA5]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email   HOME  | SERVICES  | BLOG  | ISSUES  | NEWSROOM  Dear Friend, This morning I was honored to be a part of a ceremony at the Washington State Veterans Memorial Cemetery to remember our nation's fallen heroes.  To our service members, veterans, and families: thank you for your unwavering commitment to this country and for your service to America. It is because of you that we stand as the strongest, safest, and freest nation on this earth. On this day, we come together  not as Republicans or Democrats, but as Americans  to pay homage to the brave men and women who have so valiantly defended our country; who have answered Americas call to freedom; and who have defended us in our darkest hours. So today, I ask everyone to simply remember. Remember those who have served; remember those who have sacrificed; and remember those we have lost. This years Memorial Day is particularly meaningful to me because we honor one of this generations great heroes. Let me tell you a little bit about him. He was an infantry officer stationed at Pearl Harbor on that infamous day in 1941. As he picked up his daily newspaper, the first wave of bombers arrived. He was part of Americas D-Day invasion at Omaha Beach  and survived the brutal Battle of the Bulge, which led to the loss and injury of more the 90,000 troops. He was brave, and he was heroic, and he was humble. At 100 years old, Bud Garvin  a Pearl Harbor survivor and our Spokane hero  died just last month. But in the 100 years he lived, he embodied the valor and heroism for which Americas service members have long been known. Today I ask that we remember him  and the extraordinary men and women just like him  who through their sacrifices have ensured our Freedoms. Today, our troops are answering Americas call to freedom around the world. Our Soldiers, Marines, Airmen, Sailors and Coast Guardsmen have fought the evils of tyranny. They embraced their families as they left to defend America on the battlefields. Some returned home; many did not. In his famous Gettysburg address, President Abraham Lincoln  embroiled in a war to unite and preserve the future of this country  honored Americas soldiers with these words: We are here dedicated to the great task before us  that from these honored dead we take increased devotion to that cause for which they gave the last full measure of devotion  that we resolve that these dead shall not have died in vain. More than a century later  Lincolns words still ring true. Today, as we honor our veterans who have passed before us and bow our heads in prayer, we are reminded that we live in the freest country in the world  where we are not defined by what divides us, but bound by what unites us. To our veterans and their families: thank you for all your sacrifices to serve Eastern Washington and America. May God bless you, and may God continue to bless the United States of America!

We also recommit to the values these fallen warriors have fought for for over two and one quarter centuries. I had the privilege of speaking at the Memorial Day celebration at Resthaven Mortuary Gardens. I spoke of the love that we all have for those who sacrifice for us and for their families that also have given up so much that they cherish: American soldiers fight for principles our enemies do not understand. Life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness are incomprehensible concepts to our enemies. But our service men and women protect these unalienable rights with a passion unmatched by those who would try and strip them away. Our way of life remains under attack  from Al Qaeda and from ISIS and from men like those who tried to bring terror to Ft. Riley and to Eisenhower Airport right here in Kansas. As many of us enjoy time with family and friends this weekend, let us not forget those who have made the ultimate sacrifice of laying down their lives fighting for God and country. Today and always, we give thanks to God for the blessing of living in America and for our men and women who protect us by serving as soldiers, sailors, airmen and Marines. The sacrifice these brave souls made to provide the blanket of freedom which protects all Americans must never be taken for granted.

Neugebauer's Memorial Day Message  ) As we gather with family and friends this Memorial Day weekend, we are reminded of the sacrifices generations of Americans have made to keep our great nation safe. Freedom is not free. On this Memorial Day, please join Dana and me to focus your thoughts and prayers on those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice. May we honor the brave men and women who have put on our nation's uniform and answered the call to defend our liberty. We must also pay tribute to the families of the fallen who are left to carry on after a loved one never returns home. We are eternally grateful. Speaking at Arlington National Cemetery on Memorial Day in 1982, President Reagan said, ""Those true and only building blocks of peace were the lone and lasting cause and hope and prayer that lighted the way of those whom we honor and remember this Memorial Day. To keep faith with our hallowed dead, let us be sure, and very sure, today and every day of our lives, that we keep their cause, their hope, their prayer, forever our country's own."" May God bless all those who have fought and continue to fight to defend this nation, and may He continue to bless the United States of America. Expanding Opportunity for our Veterans Last week, I supported a number of bills to increase accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) and expand opportunity for our servicemen and women. The House of Representatives passed H.R. 1038, the Ensuring VA Employee Accountability Act, which would require the VA to maintain more thorough employee records to include instances of disciplinary actions and poor performance. Over the last year, the VA has been one of the most scandal-ridden Washington agencies. Our veterans deserve much better. This common sense initiative increases accountability and makes sure our veterans receive the best possible care they've earned. I will continue to work with my colleagues to conduct appropriate oversight of the VA. The House also passed H.R. 1382, the Boosting Rates of American Veteran Employment Act. This bill would expand economic opportunities for our veterans returning to civilian life by allowing the VA to give preference to contractors who employ veterans. This would create a greater incentive for other businesses to continue to expand the hiring of our veterans and lead to good-paying jobs. I thank all of our nation's veterans and their families who selflessly serve to defend our country. In Congress, I will continue to do everything I can to ensure our veterans receive the best possible services they've earned and deserve.

[R-KS3]","Congressman Kevin Yoder, Proudly Representing the 3rd District of Kansas ========================================================================= * Honoring Those Who Sacrificed for Our Freedom* [image = Today, I was humbled and honored to be a part of two ceremonies remembering and honoring the sacrifice of the men and women who have died in service to our country.  I attended the Korean Veterans Memorial Day Ceremony at the Korean War Memorial in Overland Park and took part in the Vietnam Veterans 133rd Memorial Day Observance at the Vietnam Memorial Fountain in Kansas City where I was given an honorary life membership to the Vietnam Veterans of America.  [image = Patrick Ratterman of Kansas City Chapter #1 Veterans' of Modern Warfare.  These events marked the celebration of Memorial Day, which was first observed on May 30, 1868 for the purpose of decorating the graves of the Civil War dead.  More than a million American service members have given their lives in the wars and conflicts this nation has fought since the first colonial soldiers took up arms in 1775 to fight for independence.  These brave men and women were willing to go to the farthest corners of the world to promote the ideals of liberty and freedom knowing full well the potential for bodily harm or death.  Today, we paused to honor those heroes and remember their achievements, their courage, their dedication, and to say thank you for their sacrifices.  [image = Being recognized as a Lifetime Honorary Member of the Vietnam Veterans' of America.  These men and women came from all walks of life, sharing several fundamental qualities. They each possessed courage, pride, determination, selflessness, dedication to duty and integrity  all the qualities needed to serve a cause larger than ones self.  As an American, I am truly grateful for their sacrifice, as well as the service of each of the veterans who attended today's ceremonies.  Since the attacks of September 11, 2001, a new generation of veterans has stepped forward, serving with a dedication to duty that remains consistent with previous generations of veterans who were willing to put themselves in harms way for the greater good of all.  In Kansas, we are extremely proud of the men and women in our military that serve our country freedom and defend our liberty and freedom around the globe. Their willingness to pay the ultimate sacrifice for their countrytheir true heroismis known firsthand only to a small number, but is sadly far too common.  [image = Bob Gadd, a member of Korean War Veterans' Association 1-181 in Overland Park.  It breaks our hearts each and every time we learn the news of a soldier who has lost his life so our country can continue to live in freedom. But while we mourn their loss, we also remember that these men were inspired by the legacy of those veterans who served their country with great distinction. Their service continues to ensure that our liberty remains intact.   Our message of thanks is one that cannot be spoken strongly enough.  Please join me today in thanking our nations veterans. Your service and sacrifice has ensured the preservation of freedom and liberty we so richly enjoy. Thank you.

I joined millions of Americans in honoring America's finest. I stopped by Miami Dade Police Department's Midwest Station, which covers unincorporated parts of the county between Doral and Sweetwater in our district. A few days later, I visited Collier County Sheriff's Golden Gate substation. It was a pleasure speaking with these fine men and women that protect our communities around Florida's 25th District, but I wanted to make sure these folks truly understood my heartfelt gratitude for all the difficult and challenging work they do. The House also passed two bills last week that will greatly help law enforcement officers and their families. H.R. 606, the Don't Tax Our Fallen Public Safety Heroes Act, and H.R. 2146 the Defending Public Safety Employees' Retirement Act, allow retired officers to fully enjoy their retirement funds and benefits and also give the families of fallen officers full access to their compensation.  In honor of National Police Week, Congressman Diaz-Balart visits with Miami-Dade Police officers to thank them for their service. Congressman Diaz-Balart also spoke about H.R. 606 and H.R. 2146, two bills that will greatly help law enforcement officers and their families. The month of May also honors another line of brave men and women - our military. During Military Appreciation Month, let's take the time to honor those who have served, both past and present. Like our law enforcement, they sacrifice so much from their personal lives to ensure that our communities are out of harm's way. Last week, the House passed a number of bills to continue giving back to those who have selflessly served our country. H.R. 1382, Boosting Rates of American Veteran Employment (BRAVE) Act, gives preference to government contractors who employ veterans on a full time basis. H.R. 1313, Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Relief Act, allows surviving spouses of all disabled veterans to keep the veteran's small business through the VA's ""Vets First"" program for at least three years after the veteran has passed. H.R. 1038, Ensuring VA Employee Accountability Act, ensures transparency and accountability by requiring the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to keep all written reprimands that a VA employee receives in their file as long as they remain employed by the Department. H.R. 474, Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Programs Reauthorization Act, reauthorizes a program helps homeless veterans, for example, by providing additional funds to organizations that provide them job training. H.R. 91, Veteran's I.D. Card Act, helps to protect veterans' identity by allowing any honorably discharged to receive an I.D. card through the VA. Instead of having to carry their official military service records, which contain their social security number, service history, and other private information, the I.D. card would only display the veteran's photo, name, and a unique I.D. number that is not sensitive. All of these bills are just part of the way that House Republicans are working to serve those who serve our country and our communities. There are not enough words to express my gratitude to our law enforcement officers, our military, and our other lines of first responders who protect our nation.

H.R. 1382, the bipartisan BRAVE Act, will boost rates of veteran employment among companies that compete for contracts with the Department of Veterans Affairs by giving preference to contractors with high concentrations of full-time veteran employees. My bill was one of six we passed last week that will increase support for veterans as they transition to civilian life, help them find good jobs and affordable housing, and hold VA officials accountable for their actions. NEWSDAY: Rep. Rice passes her first bill in the House  THE HILL: House passes bills to boost veterans' assistance   Since I came to Congress in January, advocating for veterans has been one of my top priorities.

It was a pleasure last week to once again show my support for our Armed Forces and for the work of non-profit organizations who are seeking to serve those who are protecting our freedoms. _________________________  As we observed Memorial Day, we are thankful for the brave men and women who have served our great country and sacrificed to preserve our freedom. For nearly 240 years, the United States military has protected us from our enemies and those who seek to harm the cause of liberty. It is with gratitude that we remember those who have given the last full measure of devotion and have displayed the essence of America, which is the spirit of a proud and courageous people who love freedom. _________________________ This weekend, I had the privilege to participate in several community events that honor the members of our military and remember the sacrifices of those who have fought to protect our freedom. Some of these events included. *  Gathering around the American flag in the Trilogy community with Groveland residents and members of the Trilogy Orlando Veterans Association * Attending the Hero Day emphasis at Orlando Baptist Church * Participating in the Winter Garden Memorial Day Ceremony at Veterans Park * Speaking at the Hamlin & Hilbish Memorial Day Observance at Lakeside Memory Gardens in Eustis * Presenting an American flag to the family of Private Robert M.

On Memorial Day, it was my pleasure to personally thank William Henry Carter, Jr., and recognize his service as a member of the Greatest Generation by presenting him with a flag that had flown over the U.S. Capitol. Your servant,  Daniel Webster Member of Congress     Constituent Corner Recently, a constituent from Orlando visited my office to express concerns about a delay in receiving a decision on a claim regarding exposure to Agent Orange. The constituents health was steadily declining, and his wife requested us to submit a Congressional Inquiry on his behalf. After sending a Letter of Inquiry, my staff followed up with a phone call, and discovered that the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) needed additional documents from National Personnel Records Center, where the information was being reviewed. The constituent was able to provide current medical reports, which we facilitated in relaying to the agency. Following up, we confirmed that all the necessary documents had been received and attached to the constituents file. Early the next month, my office received notice that a rating decision had been made, and my staff continued monitoring the situation until we were able to communicate with the constituent that all delays had been resolved, and that the VA was able to award the constituent with the benefits that he was due. Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you. Survey Just over a year ago, reports revealed that scheduling delays within the Department of Veteran Affairs hospital system were linked with the untimely deaths of multiple veterans. Since then, Congress has passed legislation to aid in overdue and necessary reform and oversight, a new Secretary of Veterans Affairs has been selected, and our own local Central Florida VA Hospital finally opened today. Based on personal experience, second-hand knowledge, or mere perception, how would you rate the VA service in Central Florida? * Excellent  * Satisfactory  * Unacceptable  Submit your Response  Response from the previous survey question  , ""Given the danger of lone wolf terrorist threats, do you support the use of the death penalty in federal capital cases involving domestic terrorism?"" Yes - 86% No - 14% Legislative Update In the House last week, I supported several bills concerning our military personnel and veterans. Some of these measures included expanding accountability in the Department of Veterans Affairs, providing incentives for businesses that hire veterans, and reauthorizing programs that help reduce veteran homelessness. I also joined a bipartisan group of Members to introduce legislation last week that will reform the federal budget process. The legislation was a product of the Bipartisan Working Group, which I have been a part of since it began in 2011. The group is composed of twenty-six members, half Republicans and half Democrats, who meet once a week to work on legislative solutions that both parties can agree on. H.R. 2498, the Budget Integrity Act makes a series of changes to improve the federal budget process by requiring Congress to take into account the long-term consequences of its spending decisions. The bill ties the budget to the debt limit, so that if Congress passes a budget that adds to the debt, the debt limit will be automatically raised by a corresponding amount. This will ensure that Congress spending decisions are more closely tied to financial realities rather than the usual smoke and mirrors. American taxpayers deserve to have a full and transparent accounting of the financial situation of our country. This legislation will implement reforms that clearly reveal our economic situation so that we can better solve our debt crisis. You can read more about the Budget Integrity Act here  .

In honor of the contributions of our country's seniors, I'm working on a reauthorization of the Older Americans Act. I've also been spending time around the district talking with seniors and their families about the supports and services that are important to them. One of those services is Meals on Wheels. To learn more about this important program, I've helped pack and deliver meals to seniors  in Washington County and visited seniors receiving meals in Clatsop and Yamhill Counties.   At the Bob Chisholm Community Center in Seaside, I sat down with seniors who eat lunch at the center and learned about the important role that the center plays in their daily lives. It offers not just meals, but also activities and conversation. In Newberg's Chehalem Senior Center I served meals and talked with seniors about the social benefits of the program. For many of the people I meet, Older Americans Act programs, including popular nutrition programs, have made it possible to continue to live independently. In addition to Meals on Wheels, the Older Americans Act also funds other important services like protection from elder abuse, family caregiver support, and job assistance to those who are able and willing to work. My bill will reauthorize and update this important law  with new provisions for older Americans so they can live their lives with dignity. Our seniors have contributed so much to our country, and their later years should be a time for them to enjoy the lives they have built. I will continue to work to strengthen the programs older Americans rely on to live healthy and happy lives.

,114,Male,N00021207,43438,"Nolan, Richard (Rep.) [D-MN8]","Monday Report from Representative Rick Nolan top banner      Our Message to the Speaker: No More Band-Aids for America's Highways!  Click the image above to watch my Floor speech urging House Leadership to allow the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee to write a funding measure. Dear Friend, With Speaker Boehner abandoning the Committee process - refusing to allow the Transportation Committee to write a long-term bipartisan bill to reauthorize the Highway Trust Fund - Democrats on the Transportation Committee have joined me in support of the Administration's GROW AMERICA plan to invest $478 billion over six years to rebuild our nation's critical infrastructure - without adding to the federal deficit. Our move came during another week of Government by Manufactured Crisis in Washington. With Speaker Boehner playing to Tea-Party Republicans who want the federal government to stop funding highways all together, Congress had no choice but to approve another short-term extension to keep the Highway Trust Fund from expiring - a national disgrace that would have halted 6,000 critical highway projects in their tracks nationwide, and put 660,000 jobs in jeopardy at the height of the summer construction season. Here in Minnesota, federal funding accounts for 64 percent of our highway capitol program. And this summer, 600 major highway projects will directly support 9,487 construction jobs. With 65 percent of the nation's roads in poor condition and one in four bridges in need of significant repair - severely curtailing our ability to create jobs and grow the economy - the need for new sources of revenue is clear. Our GROW AMERICA legislation accomplishes that without adding to the deficit - by taxing some $2 trillion in untaxed foreign earnings that U.S. companies have accumulated overseas. Our bill includes substantial increases in support over the next six years for highways, freight, mass transit, railroads and ports. Moreover, the measure would boost vehicle and tire safety programs, and require manufacturers to act immediately to alleviate harm and inform consumers where there is an imminent risk of injury of death. The Highway Trust Fund extension will last only two months. During that time, if the Speaker will allow, Republicans and Democrats will be doing everything in our power to write a long-term bill to fund the Trust Fund. Meanwhile, the GROW AMERICA ACT provides a solid foundation for an even longer-term solution to America's rapidly worsening infrastructure crisis. We will keep you posted as events proceed. Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts. Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below or send me an  email  . Sincerely,  _____ Veterans Bills Mark Progress  As we honor those who gave their lives to protect and serve our nation, let us renew our commitment to protect and serve our returning heroes. The Veterans Memorial in Bigfork, Minnesota (pictured above) is one of my favorite places to stop and reflect on the great sacrifice our brave men and women have made for our country - I hope you were able to take some time yesterday to stop at your favorite memorial and remember those we have lost. Leading into the Memorial Day weekend, I joined Democrats and Republicans in support of several important bills to improve services for our nation's veterans and their families, including: Employment training and assistance for homeless veterans Assurances that surviving spouses of disabled veterans who own small businesses can retain small business ""preferred status"" following the veteran's death A guarantee that wartime veterans and their spouses 65 and over who receive VA ""aid and attendance"" assistance to help pay for long term care will not have that income counted against them if they apply for federal housing assistance Hiring preferences for VA contractors that employ veterans full time These measures in no way make up for the shamefully inadequate House funding bill for the Department of Veterans Affairs that scaled back health benefits for roughly 70,000 veterans, failed to provide the resources necessary to address the VA benefits backlog and failed to address the crisis of escalating veteran suicide and other serious mental and physical health issues. We'll keep fighting on those fronts. Meanwhile, these bills mark progress in fulfilling our sacred obligation to protect and serve the brave men and woman who have put themselves in harm's way to protect and serve us.  We honored America's heroes at the Brained Memorial Day ceremony - and I was happy to have the opportunity to visit with WWII Bataan Death March survivor, old family friend and local hero Walt Straka. _____ Time for a 21st Century Runway at Duluth International Airport The Duluth International Airport is critical to our ability to attract new businesses, create new jobs and bring tourists to our region from all over the nation and the world - and that's why I'm calling on Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx to support reconstruction of the main runway at the airport. The fact is the concrete pavement on Runway 9/27 has been in place since the 1940's and recent geotechnical studies have indicated that it is reaching the end of it useful life. As home to the 148th Fighter Wing, the airport is an important component of national security. As I've told Secretary of Transportation Foxx, this major runway reconstruction will go a long way toward preserving sustainable air commerce growth and freedom of movement for all who use the airport for many years to come, and I'll continue to do everything in my power to see that federal funding is approved. Click here  to read the letter. _____ Standing With U.S. Consumers & Farmers as the 'COOL' Debate Heats Up  Minnesota Congressman and Ranking Member on the Agriculture Committee Collin Peterson and I met with Minnesotans from the National Farmers Union who thanked us for our support for county of origin labeling. Canada, Mexico and multi-national agri-business corporations may disagree - but Americans should have the right to know where the meat they buy is coming from. That's why I joined fellow Minnesotans Tim Walz and Collin Peterson in opposing legislation to repeal country of origin labeling (""COOL"" in the language of Washington acronyms) for beef, pork and chicken last week on the House Agriculture Committee. This bill - which still faces an uncertain future in the full House and Senate - is one more example of how ill-conceived trade agreements work against the interests of American farmers and consumers. Supporters of the measure cited rulings by the World Trade Organization finding that U.S. labeling - which stipulates that an animal is raised and processed in America - discriminates against Canadian and Mexican producers. And they fear retaliatory tariffs from those countries against other U.S. products. To be clear - no trade agreement should ever supersede the right of U.S. consumers to ""Buy American"" if they so choose. We will continue to stand with American consumers and American family farmers as this bill moves forward. _____ Victims of Trafficking Act Heads to the President's Desk Last week brought another big win in the fight against sex trafficking. The House approved the Senate's strong anti-trafficking bill to support victims and hold perpetrators accountable - and the bill now heads to the President's desk. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act is an extension of bipartisan legislation we passed last year - including an amendment that I cosponsored with my Republican colleague Rep. Ted Poe of Texas to establish a budget-neutral fund to aid trafficking victims - who average 12 years of age - with a wide range of counseling and resources to help them put their lives back together. The good news here is that Congress is finally recognizing what advocates and volunteers across Minnesota have always understood - women and children who are tricked, lured and kidnapped by traffickers are not criminals. They are victims who are entitled to all the protection, help and counseling our society can offer. At the same time, we must ensure that those convicted of participating in trafficking feel the full weight of the law. Day by day, we are building bipartisan support to fight against this scourge on society. _____ Coast Guard Bill Promotes Great Lakes Jobs  Here's a few from the desk of a Coast Guard ice breaking vessel working hard in the Port of Duluth. The House last week overwhelmingly passed Coast Guard Reauthorization legislation that includes two amendments especially beneficial to the Port of Duluth-Superior, a facility that supports some 11,500 jobs - $545 million in wages - and $1.5 billion in business revenue launching 40 million tons of iron ore, coal, steel, wind turbines and other cargo up the Great Lakes every year. The first amendment, which I sponsored with Republican Congressman Bob Gibbs of Pennsylvania, will help Great Lakes vessels travel faster and safer by allowing shippers the flexibility to discharge ballast water - a process necessary for safe navigation - while also protecting marine sanctuaries that promote tourism and preserve history. The Coast Guard bill also includes our Transportation Committee provision for construction of a unique new ""fresh water ice"" breaking vessel that will lengthen and extend the Great Lakes Shipping season and help create new jobs across our region. The new ship will be especially designed to plow through tough fresh water ice that can be three to four feet thick on Lake Superior. Every day we can extend the shipping season, and make shipping faster and safer, makes a difference as we work to create more good jobs from Duluth all the way to the Atlantic Ocean. _____ Our Week in DC  Congresswoman Betty McCollum and I welcomed Matt Olsen, Bill Polchow and his son Sam with the Boilermakers to Washington last week and heard their concerns about the Trans-Pacific Partnership, funding for Tech Colleges and H2B visas. Our Week in Duluth  Our field representative Mark Privratsky attended a ""rebranding"" event with Ever-green Energy CEO Ken Smith, former Lieutenant Governor Yvonne Prettner Solon, Chief Administrative Officer Dave Montgomery, Mayor Don Ness, Energy Systems Plant Manager Jim Green and Ecolibrium3 CEO Jodi Slick at the former Duluth steam plant - which will now be named Duluth Energy Systems. The unveiling event is the beginning of a process to reconfigure the district heat in downtown Duluth to a closed loop system, removing inefficiency caused by the 80 year old design of the facility. Our Week in Rock Creek  Our field representative Rick Olseen joined the groundbreaking for construction work on Minnesota Highway 70 in Pine County last week. Construction workers, local residents, regional development people, MNDOT staff and District 1 Engineer Duane Hill came together to oversee the project's take-off. Previously, MNDOT Commissioner Charlie Zelle and I took a bus tour of the route and saw firsthand the desperate the need for repair and reconstruction. Our Week in Hibbing  Our field representative Jordan Metsa attended the ""30 Years in Business"" open house at the Access North Center for Independent Living of Northeastern Minnesota. Access North employs 500 people and has an annual budget of $8 million. _____ Coming Up in Minnesota This week: . We will announce new details on our continuing efforts to keep the Duluth mail sorting facility open. _____ Finally... Happy 50th Anniversary, Head Start!  Last week marked the 50th anniversary of America's Head Start program - a program that has served 32 MILLION children and their families across our nation. As the former director of the North Central Minnesota 19-unit Head Start program, I'm especially proud to congratulate Head Start educators on this accomplishment - and for the wonderful opportunities they provide for our children. Head Start is critical to our national commitment to give every child - regardless of their circumstances at birth - an opportunity to succeed in school and in life. The simple truth is there is nothing more important to the development of a child than early education - and developing that spark for learning that lasts a lifetime and sets kids up for success. So once again, hats off to all the educators, directors, faculty and parents who have made this program such a great success for our children.

senior,"113,114,115",Male,N00003535,400050,"Brown, Sherrod (Sen.) [D-OH]","Combatting Prescription Drug Abuse in Ohio Drug overdoses are on the rise across Ohio. In 2013, we saw a record 2,110 fatal overdoses in our state. Opioid abuse in particular has wreaked havoc across Ohio, devastating thousands of families. When its easier for Americans to access opioids than it is for them access help to treat their addiction, we have a serious problem. Thats why I worked across the aisle this week to introduce the bipartisan Recovery Enhancement for Addiction Treatment Act (TREAT Act), which would allow health care providers to treat larger numbers of patients struggling with addiction to opioids like painkillers and heroin. Current law limits the number of patients a health care provider can treat for opioid abuse problems using medication-assisted treatment programs. This has left patients to languish on waiting lists for critical treatment. My bill would update U.S. law to enable qualified physicians to treat larger numbers of patients struggling with addiction and, for the first time, allow certain nurse practitioners and physician assistants to provide supervised, medication-assisted treatment for patients. We must ensure that there are a variety of treatment options available for those who need help battling addiction, including effective medication-assisted treatment. By allowing doctors to treat more patients and utilize medication-assisted treatment in combination with behavioral health support, we can change the course for treating opioid addiction for the better. Opioid addiction is a chronic disease that, when left untreated, places a large burden on our health care system. Deaths from opioid overdoses in the United States have increased by more than five times since 1980. Each year, about 475,000 emergency room visits are attributable to the misuse and abuse of opioid pain killers across the U.S. We also need to do more to get drugs out of wrongful hands. Too many Ohioans can easily get prescription drugs from the family medicine cabinet or from family and friends who no longer use the medicines they were legally prescribed. Thats why last week I, along with several of my Senate colleagues, sent a letter to Attorney General Loretta Lynch urging her to reinstate the Drug Enforcement Administrations s National Drug Take-Back Days. This program has successfully provided Americans with the opportunity to safely turn over unwanted, unneeded, and expired medications so they dont end up in the hands of people who may abuse them. Last Septembers Take-Back Day in Ohio featured 194 sites available for safe drug disposal throughout the state, and was a tremendous success. Abuse of prescription drugsespecially painkillerscan devastate communities. We can and must do more to keep these medications out of the hands of those who abuse them, and to get Ohioans dealing with addiction the help that they need.

I write to share a bit of what I have been working on here in Congress over the last year and to recap some of the issues our office invested time in since last May. In addition to activity in Washington, I have also tried to spend a lot of time listening to people at home. In fact, over the year, we have hosted six Open Door After 4:00 events, 12 Neighborhood Office Hours, four Town Halls, and six Coffee with Your Congressman events. They are simple in format but all tied to the same thing, and that's trying to hear more of what's on your mind so I can better represent those thoughts and concerns in Washington. During these meetings, I've been able to talk with some of you individually about different policy issues that have surfaced in Washington, but what falls below is a synopsis of some of what's happened in this office over the last year. Bear with me though...it's a long one given so much has been happening! One last point before we get into the issues: if you have thoughts on what we've been working on or any questions or concerns, please reach out by emailing me here  . Also this year, I want to connect even more with the people I represent, and for that reason, I'd hope that you'd forward this newsletter along to your friends or family who may be interested. If this newsletter was passed along to you, you can sign up to get my monthly newsletter by clicking here  . ? Budget: It really is the big news of the last year. I was dismayed by President Obama's 2016 budget proposal  . I believe his budget was unsound in the short and the long-term, as it raises taxes and spending now and does little to control the mandatory spending that is driving our exploding national debt. In fact, his budget proposes to make our financial hole deeper as it would have run continued deficits and added $8 trillion to the national debt and $2.1 trillion in new taxes such that the budget never actually balanced. I am a member of the House Budget Committee, and we held multiple hearings following the release of the President's budget. Take a look at two of the Q&A portions I had in these hearings: the first with the Director of the Congressional Budget Office  , the second with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget  . Last year in April, I voted for the Ryan Budget  , which would have reduced the growth in spending by $5 trillion over ten years. Again this March, I supported the Republican budget  that, while not perfect, takes a far different path from the President as it lays out a plan to reduce deficit spending by $5.5 trillion, not raise taxes, and attempts to balance in ten years. The process in getting to it was involved; in fact, we held votes on six different federal budget proposals. Each proposal was voted on individually, and the budget with the most votes won. The video below shows a portion of what I said against one of these proposals, put forward by the Progressive Caucus:  Rep. Sanford Speaks Against Democratic Budget Amendments I voted for the blueprint that came out of the House Budget Committee. As just mentioned, it took a big-picture look at government spending and set us on a path to eliminate the federal debt and deficit without raising taxes. Unfortunately, because this proposal attempted to cut other portions of government to pay for increases in defense spending, it failed by a vote of 105 to 319. Ultimately, the Price-Thornberry Budget prevailed and was almost identical to the original House budget. The difference between these two was that Price-Thornberry included $20 billion in additional spending for a special overseas military operations account called the Overseas Contingency Operations that was not offset by savings elsewhere in the budget. This version passed with a vote of 219 to 208. While I objected to not paying for these additions to the overseas military operations account, I ultimately supported this plan because it was the only budget that had a chance of passage by the House Republican Conference - and passing some sort of a budget over to the Senate was vital to returning to a thing called ""regular order,"" which I will explain in just a second. Because Price-Thornberry won the most votes, it was presented for a final vote. The proposal passed 288 to 199. The Senate passed its own version of the bill in late March, and the two chambers produced a joint budget resolution that passed the House in late April and the Senate in early May. With a budget in place, we are now back to what's called ""regular order."" It's been absent for about ten years, and this order means budget caps are set in each of the 12 different categories of government that used to be debated. The caps procedurally allow for these debates, and without them we have ended up with giant omnibus bills and so-called continuing resolutions that essentially put government on automatic pilot. The creation of a budget, which had been largely absent since Harry Reid took over in the Senate, was vital to spending caps, ""regular order"" and the debate that comes with it, and avoiding giant omnibus bills as the way we fund our federal government. The big question is on how long this budget will last, and in this vein I am concerned about what may come this fall.but we will see. ? Homeowner Flood Insurance Affordability Act: Many in the Lowcountry contacted me regarding how reforms to the National Flood Insurance Program were going to affect them. In most cases, the changes in premiums were sudden and drastic, leading me and others in Congress to work toward reforming the program. While the reforms were well-intentioned, I think the government needs to give people time to adapt to these sorts of changes. To this end, I cosponsored the Homeowner's Flood Insurance Affordability Act  because it provided a path to continue the conversation about how to mitigate these effects while still bringing needed change to the National Flood Insurance Program. ? Water Resources Reform & Development Act of 2014: This law ensured necessary investments in our nation's port and waterways infrastructure; cut federal red tape, bureaucracy, and waste in the project delivery process; and helped create jobs. As this bill was earmark-free and kept the Port of Charleston deepening on schedule, I voted in favor of the proposal, which was signed into law last June. ? Transportation Security Administration (TSA): Recently, the House passed the TSA Office of Inspection Accountability Act  , which requires the TSA to end the practice of paying higher wages to employees for skills they don't use. I cosponsored this plan, which was based off a bill I introduced last June when I was a member of the Homeland Security Committee. ? Common Core: In February of last year, I signed onto a resolution opposing Common Core at the federal level. Education is a local matter, and states should have the flexibility to address the needs of local students without federal interference. I remain committed to supporting states' rights in the Common Core debate - if a state chooses to implement standards like Common Core, it should be because the state believes that would be best for its students, not because of federal mandates. ? Immigration: Last year, I voted for H.R. 5230  , which funds agencies dealing with the border crisis by cutting from other parts of the federal budget. I also voted for H.R. 5272  to defund the President's Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals directive and disapprove of a unilateral amnesty plan offered by the President. ? Amnesty: In an op-ed  in The Post and Courier, I expressed my opposition to unilateral executive amnesty. I also signed Rep. Matt Salmon's letter to House Appropriations Committee Chairman Hal Rogers, urging the committee to include language in an upcoming appropriations bill that would deny funding for the President's executive amnesty program. Last December, I voted in favor of the Executive Amnesty Prevention Act  that would stop current executive amnesty as well as any future executive action favoring certain groups of people who are here illegally over those who are trying to immigrate to this country lawfully. ? Foreign Military Aid and Action: Israel enjoys a unique tie to America just as it's the other way around, and I think to be a great ally it must be for the long run, not just the next few years. My vote on Iron Dome was tied to this principle and the new ways that popular bills are not paid for in Washington. Our current spending trajectory guarantees we will not be much of an ally to anyone if we stay on course because, according to the Congressional Budget Office, we will have only enough to pay for interest and entitlement spending.and nothing else in just ten years. For this reason, I was one of eight lawmakers who voted against funding Israel's Iron Dome Missile System  last summer because the $225 million cost was not paid for. While I have always supported Israel's unique ties with our country, I don't think popular votes like these should be used to avoid paying for a bill's cost. This sadly has become a recurring theme, and I think staying consistent in pushing to pay for the expenditures we make is important.in our ability to be a real ally over the long run. I also think we have to be on watch for bills that lack operational detail or constitutional authority. For example, I voted against training and arming Syrian rebels to fight ISIS and was also critical of the President's unilateral military action in the region. I did so not because they were necessarily bad things in and of themselves - but because the first was a plan without the detail I think required of war and because the other did not entail Congress's consent. I believe the Constitution is crystal clear in its direction that only Congress can authorize war. Similarly, I opposed the National Defense Authorization Act for 2015  because it would codify unilateral military action taken by the President in the Middle East without the approval of Congress. ? The NSA and Civil Liberties: I voted against the USA Freedom Act  , a bill I originally cosponsored, because of changes made to the proposal. These changes would allow the NSA to collect information on American citizens without a specific target and would also compel telephone and technology companies to provide large amounts of data to the NSA indiscriminately. I also opposed the Intelligence Authorization Act for 2014  and 2015  because they didn't go far enough to rein in the NSA and protect individual liberty and privacy. ? NASA: Advances in technology should make it easier for private sector entities, not the federal government, to carry on space exploration. For that reason, I voted against the NASA Authorization Act  last June. Unfortunately, the bill was voice-voted through in February. ? Cuba: In the final week of January, I introduced the Freedom to Travel to Cuba Act of 2015  to remove the travel ban to Cuba that has been in place for more than 50 years. This bill is part of a bipartisan effort to protect every United States citizen's constitutional right to travel. Is it not strange that one can travel to any country in the world without federal prohibition, save one...Cuba? While the President made policy changes to lift some of the restrictions on traveling to Cuba for the remainder of his presidency, this bill would remove those restrictions permanently.  Rep. Sanford Speaks with Alex Wagner on Cuba ? Veterans: The Miller-Sanders Veterans Bill  was aimed at reforming some of the health care problems in the VA system, while at the same time creating a new entitlement to health care services that would carry far-reaching financial implications for every veteran and civilian taxpayer in the First District. The VA system has already grown in spending by 58% since 2009, and I think the first question we should ask in light of that sort of increase is whether or not the additional funds were getting to the places where they made a real difference in veterans' health care. In many cases, they were not. As to the new entitlement, the Congressional Budget Office projected it would cost $500 billion dollars over the next ten years. This is an astounding number for something that, in this case, was not part of the debate and more significantly was not offset. Non-offset, again, means rather than paying for this new program by trimming some other area of government or allocating new taxes to pay for it, it's just added straight to the national debt. Families reconfigure their budgets when things get tough. Prudent households don't say, ""Let's just add it to the credit card."" Yet this is what was done here because, as already mentioned, one of the new trends I have witnessed in Washington since my return is that if something is politically popular, leadership does not bother paying for it. It's a mistake, and though I very much wanted to support this bill, since it was not paid for I voted ""no."" ? Department of Homeland Security (DHS) Funding: One of the most talked about issues in recent months was the debate for funding DHS  . In January, the House passed a bill to fully fund DHS until September 30th that would have also prohibited the President's executive actions on immigration. Unfortunately, a combination of moderate Republicans and Democrats scrubbed the immigration language and passed a so-called ""clean"" bill through both chambers. Congress disappointingly relinquished its power to the President's unconstitutional overreach, and even a federal judge in Texas agreed that the President was out of constitutional bounds in his action. Congress has a real responsibility to make a stand on what it believes to be constitutional, and this is something that should not be jettisoned or deferred as every one of us when sworn into Congress pledges to uphold the Constitution. If Congress believes something is unconstitutional, it should use its one strongest power - the power of the purse - and defund the activity, and that's what the action at the start of the year was all about. In fact, what could be more reasonable than saying we will fund everything save what a judge in Texas has ruled unconstitutional! That's not how it was reported by the media, and so Congress caved to the President's executive action. I believe this leads to more unilateral actions, and that is hardly a trend most want embraced! ? Ebola: Last October, I attended a Homeland Security Committee hearing in Dallas on the U.S. Ebola strategy and signed onto the Stop Ebola Act  , which would have banned travel from the infected countries and stopped visas from being issued to people who were traveling, or had traveled, to those areas. While other countries restrict their airlines from traveling to areas infected with Ebola, the United States had no such restriction. ? Trauma Care: In March, Congress tackled the issue of how to fund local trauma centers. Although both the Access to Life-Saving Trauma Care for All Americans Act  and the Trauma Systems and Regionalization of Emergency Care Reauthorization Act  passed by votes of 389 to 10 and 382 to 15, respectively, I voted against them after careful thought. While I support the work of trauma centers, this legislation would add $626 million in spending over the next five years on a variety of trauma care grants that had either never been funded or had expired. While new money can certainly be put to good use, it isn't fiscally responsible to increase federal funding - even for good projects - when the spending isn't offset. Again you see more of the trend, if the vote is popular, why ""offset?"" Yet not doing so speeds a financial day of reckoning that will have real impact for veterans, allies, and even trauma centers. ? Taxes & Entitlement Spending: Last year, I voted against the Achieving a Better Life Act of 2014  because it would increase entitlement spending by $1.15 billion by relaxing requirements to qualify for Social Security programs. I also voted against the Tax Increase Prevention Act of 2014  because, while the bill was intended to extend 51 ""temporary tax cuts"" (many of which I liked and many of which by the way have been ""temporary"" since 1992), it was primarily a vehicle to support the wind energy industry. I like renewable energy, but should the federal government really pick winners and losers in this field? The cost for solar in the bill was $6.4 billion. Allocating so many billions of dollars in financial advantage over tide, hydro, or other renewable forms of energy is a good idea? Finally, this bill really did seem to favor the big over the small. In contrast to the 15% of the bill that wind energy comprised, homeowners got a mortgage insurance tax break worth only 2% of the bill. In total, the bill was projected to increase the deficit by $42 billion dollars, and for the reasons listed above I voted against it ? Debt: Last month, I introduced the Debt Limit Control and Accountability Act of 2015  , which reasserts Congress's constitutional responsibility to pay the nation's debts. Since 2011, Congress has stopped setting a dollar limit on exactly how much the federal government is allowed to borrow. Instead, the dollar amount has been replaced with a window of time, and the debt ceiling increase since then has been based on the debt incurred during that period. Basically, Congress is giving a credit card to the Treasury Department and telling them to use it for a few months and let us know what the bill is. Taxpayers should ultimately know how much borrowing is done in their name before the money is borrowed, not after the bill comes due.The bottom line on all this is that there are many tools that we can use to temper Washington's many biases toward spending more of what you have, and this bill represents a new addition to the toolkit if we can get it passed. ? Controlled Substances: An additional bill that I cosponsored was the Industrial Hemp Farming Act of 2015  , introduced in March, which would remove industrial hemp as a substance that qualifies as marijuana under the law. Last May, South Carolina passed a law that legalized growing industrial hemp by licensed farmers, and now farmers at home and in other states need assurance that they will not run afoul of federal laws that ban a whole host of hemp-related products. Industrial hemp is not a drug - it is used as a material in paper products, textiles, and plastics. Local farmers interested in growing industrial hemp are still facing unnecessary federal roadblocks, and accordingly this law was all about the principle of federalism. Not all decisions should be made in Washington, and the laws of states should be honored rather than usurped by the federal government. There were a host of votes I took over the last year that fit with this thinking. ? Offshore Drilling: Last month, I announced my opposition to offshore drilling off the coast of South Carolina. I did so based on my concern over the look and feel of our coastline, the public opposition from nine towns in the First District, and the limited involvement South Carolinians would have in the decision whether or not to proceed with drilling. I have never supported offshore drilling, but was willing to consider the idea based on seismic testing data that would allow South Carolinians to debate the issue and reach an informed decision on whether or not they wanted to move forward. As I studied the issue, I came to learn that South Carolinians would in fact never have that chance to deliberate. We would never even see the seismic data until after leases had been sold to oil companies. I don't believe weighing the balance between large blocks of untouched coastal areas and an established tourism industry against the potential benefits of drilling is something that Washington officials are best positioned to do. In my view, it made little sense to conduct tests when the states and regions affected would ultimately not be involved in the decision-making process.  Rep. Sanford Voices His Opposition to Offshore Drilling Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure Highlights ? Taxpayer Savings: I am on the Committee on Transportation and Infrastructure, and there were some good steps taken by the committee to save taxpayers' money last year. For example, the committee is responsible for considering General Services Administration proposals for constructing, improving, and leasing federal offices and workspace and, in the last year, helped General Services shift from three-year leases to leases of ten or more years. By focusing on proposals that consolidate and shrink the federal government's real estate footprint, the committee helped to ensure real taxpayer savings  of more than $2.2 billion last year. These are small efforts in the grand scheme of things, but directionally right. ? Highway Trust Fund: The committee recently kicked off the Surface Transportation funding debate with a hearing aimed at getting some answers from Anthony Foxx, the Secretary of Transportation. At issue is the Highway Trust Fund and its persistent lack of funds to pay for highway construction projects and its looming shortfall. As I pointed out to Secretary Foxx, there are many programs taking money from the trust fund that don't pay into it, which is a fundamental problem with all too many trust funds in Washington. I believe that in order to talk about addressing the solvency problem, cutting spending has to be part of the debate, and so in March, I introduced the Highway Restoration Act of 2015  to address the funding problems of the Highway Trust Fund. This bill would phase out mass transit spending over a period of five years and accordingly cut the annual deficit from the Highway Trust Fund in half. Ideas like this are as much as anything about trying to begin a conversation about doing something other than raising taxes as a way to solve the Highway Trust Fund dilemma.  Rep. Sanford Questions Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx ? I visited the Wando Terminal at home with Secretary Foxx along with Vice President Biden. While it was good to be able to talk with them about the Port and all it does, I do not support the Grow America Act  they were pushing during the visit. Part of the way they propose to pay for their plan is to implement a 14% tax on foreign earnings for U.S. companies. I think this tax increase would be bad for a lot of companies, including ones like Boeing, and for that reason among others, it is not a plan that I think fits the views of most I have discussed it with at home. ? Federal Funding for Amtrak: The House voted on the Passenger Rail Reform and Investment Act  in March, which passed by a vote of 316 to 101. The bill authorized more than $7 billion in federal funds for Amtrak over the next four years, and it contained some noteworthy reforms such as added route competition and transparency at Amtrak in ways that could be helpful to the taxpayer. The Transportation Committee I serve on had the difficult task of trying to make Amtrak run more like a business. Did you know, for instance, that since Amtrak first began operating in 1971, it has never made a profit? This raises serious questions about the ability of Amtrak to make sure its passengers are safe, especially in light of the most recent accident on the Northeast Corridor line. Amtrak keeps turning to the government to bail it out, which gives the company less incentive to make sure its operations are cost efficient. Ultimately, I did not think the legislation changed Amtrak enough to warrant the increased taxpayer subsidy that would still go to them, and accordingly, I voted against the bill. While this is by no means an exhaustive list of the many things we worked on over the last year, I have tried to touch on some of the relevant issues and themes we have contended with and will continue to contend with in the year ahead.

It's an important opportunity to express our deep gratitude for the sacrifices made by the men and women who fought for our nation and never returned home. Each one of us lives under the blanket of freedom provided by the Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines, Coast Guardsmen, and Merchant Mariners who head into battle and defend America. And on Memorial Day, we remember the many brave patriots who lost their lives in defense of our nation to protect our God given liberties.  Olson Pays Respect to fallen Marine LCpl Phillip Carson George As a tribute to the fallen and those who have defended our nation and are still with us, last week in the House, we passed legislation to keep help keep our promise to our veterans. Below is a list of bills passed to help veterans and their families: H.R. 474  - Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Programs Reauthorization Act of 2015  This bill extends the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) homeless veterans reintegration program through Fiscal Year 2020. Passed the House by voice vote. H.R. 1038  - Ensuring VA Employee Accountability Act  This bill requires the VA to keep a record of any reprimand received by a VA employee on that employee's permanent record while they are employed by the VA. Passed the House by voice vote. H.R. 1313  - Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Relief Act  This bill allows a surviving spouse of a veteran with a service-connected disability rating of 100%, or who dies as a result of a service-connected disability, to retain the veterans small business status for up to 10 years following death. This helps surviving spouses transition their small business in a positive way after losing their loved one. Passed the House by a roll call vote of 403-0. H.R. 1382  - Boosting Rates of American Veteran Employment (BRAVE) Act  The BRAVE Act allows the VA to award contracts to businesses based on the percentage of that business's full-time employees who are veterans. The goal is to boost employment rates for veterans by rewarding companies that provide such incentives and encouraging others to do the same. Passed the House by a roll call vote of 404-0. H.R. 91  - Veteran's I.D. Card Act  This bill requires the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to issue a veteran's identification card to any veteran who requests one, which ensures they don't have to carry discharge papers to receive care. The card will serve as proof that the veteran served honorably in the Armed Forces. Passed the House by a roll call vote of 402-0. H.R. 1816  - Vulnerable Veterans Housing Reform Act  This bill amends the United States Housing Act of 1937 to end the flawed Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) policy of counting the aid and attendance benefit for low-income, disabled veterans as regular income. Passed the House by voice vote. The wars we wage take their toll on many Americans. We are blessed to have an extended weekend to honor those we have lost and remember the sacrifices of brave Americans so that we may live freely in the greatest nation on earth. On this Memorial Day and every day, may they and all of the fallen throughout history always be in our thoughts and prayers. May God bless you, may God bless Texas, and may God bless America!

,114,Male,N00036633,43691,"Abraham, Ralph (Rep.) [R-LA5]"," News from Congressman Ralph Abraham  Home  Contact  Services  Media Center  About  Fighting the EPA for Our Farmers Dear Friend, I wanted to take a moment to tell you about recent legislation we passed in the House that can have a great impact on our famers at home in the 5th District. A group of young farmers and ranchers from various places throughout Louisiana visited my office in March to make sure I knew the issues they face daily as they set about running their farms and ranches. Some talked about crop insurance. Others voiced their support for opening up new markets on which they can sell their commodities. But the one issue that had everyone anxious was overreach from the Environmental Protection Agency, or more specifically, the Waters of the U.S. (WOTUS) proposed rule. These young farmers are not alone in their concern. In fact, nearly every agricultural or waterway organization I meet with all but begs Congress to repeal the WOTUS rule because of the burdensome regulations it imposes on not only water usage, but also land usage. Farmers, I have good news: Congress has heard you. On May 13, the House of Representatives passed the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act to withdraw the proposed WOTUS rule. As the only member of the Louisiana delegation on the House Agriculture Committee, I was proud to cosponsor and vote for this legislation and once again serve as a strong voice for our states farmers. WOTUS is about control. The EPA wants to regulate a puddle because that puddle water might run into a ditch, that then it might run into a stream, that then might run into river. Such strict control over a farmers land and water is crippling to the proper flow of business and it infringes upon landowners rights. I side with farmers they are the best conservationists on the planet. Farmers make their living off of the land, so theyd never do anything to harm it. Besides, its utterly ridiculous to think the federal government knows a tract of land better than the farmer who works it every day. WOTUS became like so many other policies that are indicative of this administration: Its a top-down, we know better than you, do as we say mentality. The bill the House passed changes that. This bill withdraws the WOTUS rule. It requires the EPA and the Army Corps of Engineers to develop a new rule to define navigable waters of the U.S. This should prevent over regulation of water and curb abuse of the program. This bill takes real steps toward curtailing the overreach of the EPA. Under this act, the EPA must act in accordance with the limits set by Congress and the Supreme Court to ensure that the rights of landowners are not violated. Perhaps most importantly, this bill requires that the new rule be constructed with consultation from local officials, stakeholders and other interested parties. Those who will be most affected by any new rules will have the largest hand in crafting any new policy, and the EPA will have to publish a public report to prove it is working with locals throughout the process. The Houses action on this bill is encouraging, but were only a part of the way through the process. Ill continue to monitor this legislation as it makes its way through the Senate. Hopefully, my colleagues in the other chamber will also recognize how important this legislation is to farmers and landowners and how it protects them from federal overreach. The Regulatory Integrity Protection Act is a win for Louisianas farmers. With that under our belts, we can look toward other policy to help Louisianas farmers, such as expanding markets, promoting trade policies that are favorable to the United States and protecting farmers from foreign market manipulations. As the representative of one of the largest row crop districts in the nation, it is my honor to go to bat every day for farmers in the 5th District. Know that I will tackle these agricultural issues as aggressively as I worked to remove the proposed WOTUS rule.

Earlier in the week, I joined my colleagues on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in meeting with the Secretary of the U.S. Department of Transportation, Anthony Foxx. During this meeting, we discussed the GROW AMERICA Act, of which I am an original cosponsor. The GROW AMERICA Act includes a long-term surface transportation reauthorization bill that provides robust funding and sustainable solutions to our nation's infrastructure crisis. This bill would benefit people in New Jersey and across the country. Continuing Transportation and Infrastructure Committee work, I attended a hearing assessing the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (FEMA) role in earthquake hazard preparedness, mitigation, response, and recovery. Later in the week, I attended a Committee markup and supported the General Service Administration (GSA) reform bill. This bill would increase accountability and oversight, streamline leasing programs, and enhance building security. The Foreign Affairs Committee's Subcommittee on Europe, Eurasia, and Emerging Threats held a hearing last week to assess current U.S. - Hungarian relations. As a NATO ally, Hungary partners with the United States in promoting democracy and stability in the region and has also deployed troops to help fight ISIS. During the hearing, I asked several questions regarding Hungary's energy strategy and how the United States can reduce Russia's influence on their energy sector. Several groups traveled from New Jersey last week to meet with me in Washington. Members of the National Air Traffic Controllers Association (NATCA) came to discuss current issues impacting the industry. During the meeting we discussed the Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen), Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) Reauthorization, and the effects sequestration has had on the FAA. The International Brotherhood of Boilermakers Local #28 from Newark also visited last week. The Boilermakers primarily work in nuclear and fossil power plants; however, they also work in shipyards, refineries, and chemical plants. The group discussed EPA regulations and protecting American jobs. Also visiting from the Garden State were members of both the New Jersey Rural Letter Carriers' Association and the Jersey City Letter Carriers' Association. During our meetings, we discussed the importance of preserving door-to-door delivery, six-day delivery, and reviving previous mail delivery standards. Our district has over 2,000 postal service employees and houses over 40 separate postal facilities. These employees work hard every day to deliver the mail we depend on and I will continue to be a strong advocate for them. Students and deans from Dorman Honors College at NJIT in Newark visited during their trip last week to Capitol Hill. The goal of the group's visit was to give technology students the experience of meeting with policy makers and to learn the legislative process. I am always excited to meet with students when they travel to Washington and enjoyed discussing important topics in education with them. I was happy to discuss military issues with colleagues at a USO event on Capitol Hill last week. The dedicated people of the USO do great work in supporting our troops and facilitating civilian involvement. I always look forward to taking part in USO's events as a small way to give thanks to our brave men and women in uniform. Recently, I had the privilege of accepting the U.S. Representative of the Year Award from the New Jersey Conference of Mayors. As a former mayor, I understand how valuable the members of the Conference of Mayors are in developing local, state, and federal policy. Continuing my work in Congress, I will keep using the perspectives of the Conference to work on policies that benefit New Jersey and the 8th District. Thank you for reading the Washington Review.

[D-TX9]","Congressman Al Green, Representing 9th District of Texas *Congressman Al Greens Statement on the Fifth Circuit Court's Decision on the President's Executive Actions on Immigration* On Tuesday, May 26, 2015, Congressman Al Green released the following statement on the Fifth Circuits decision to deny the Obama administrations request to lift an injunction against the implementation of immigration executive actions. I think I speak for many when I say, We are disappointed but not dispirited or disillusioned. Many legal scholars believe President Obama acted boldly within his legal authority to address problems within our immigration system and border security. The Obama administration has only sought to hold undocumented immigrants accountable, provide some relief for millions of law-abiding undocumented immigrants and their families, as well as secure our borders. President Obamas actions follow the tradition of many other Presidents, who used executive authority to modify our immigration system to better serve our national interests, Congressman Al Green said. It is my hope that the Obama administration appeals this ruling to the Supreme Court. An issue of such paramount importance, which has the potential to decide the fate of so many, should be reviewed by the highest court in the land. ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- WASHINGTON, DC OFFICE 2347 Rayburn HOB Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-7508 Fax: (202) 225-2947 Hours: M-F 9AM-5PM EST HOUSTON OFFICE 3003 South Loop West, Suite 460 Houston, TX 77054 Phone: 713-383-9234 Fax: 713-383-9202 Hours: M-F 9AM-5PM CST WEBSITE: UNSUBSCRIBE: PRIVACY POLICY: ",2015-01-06,9,Rep.,Representative,true,TX,al.green@congressnewsletter.net,05/26/2015,Democrat,49680,,http://algreen.house.gov,Representative for Texas's 9th congressional district,Al,RepAlGreen,,Green,G000553,202-225-7508,1947-09-01,https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/al_green/400653,RepAlGreen,,representative,1012969,Representative,2017-01-03,Rep.

,114,Male,N00006446,43411,"Salmon, Matt (Rep.) [R-AZ5]"," A Message From Congressman Matt Salmon Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email  Banner Image 550px by 110px Dear Friend, I've posted a new update on the latest from Washington on my website. Please take a minute to read the full post at the link below. Matt _____ Shrinking our Spending and Recognizing Our Veterans Link  This week I introduced  my third Shrink our Spending bill  designed to defund the EPAs BEACH Act Grants. In 2000, the Beaches Environmental Assessment and Coastal Health Act (BEACH Act) was signed into law to assist state and local health officials in developing and implementing beach monitoring programs at our nations beaches. Since 2001, EPA has made available nearly 130 million in taxpayer dollars on the program, but President Obama and the EPA both agree that state and local government programs have the technical expertise and procedures to continue beach monitoring without federal support. Were being asked to spend millions of dollars on unnecessary federal efforts that are duplicative at best, so Im proposing we save the U.S. taxpayer $9.5 million this year alone and end this program. More information on my SOS initiative is available at my website or by clicking here  . On Tuesday, the House passed H.R. 2250  , the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2016, by a vote of 357-67  . H.R. 2250 provides $3.3 billion for the operations of the Legislative Branch, including funding House committees, Capitol Police, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Architect of the Capitol (AOC), the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC), Library of Congress (LOC), Government Publishing Office (GPO), and the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The bill spends $172.3 million less than the President's request. Funding for the House of Representatives has been reduced by 14 percent since the Republicans gained the House majority in 2011. In addition, the House passed H.R. 2353  , the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2015, by a vote of 387-35  . H.R. 2353 extends the authority of the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) through July 31, 2015. The HTF currently has sufficient resources to fund its obligations through this period. I voted against this bill because it continues to kick the can down the road on solving the numerous problems with the Highway Trust Fund. On Wednesday, I hosted another teletown hall to discuss the current issues before Congress and address your concerns. I always appreciate hearing from my constituents, and look forward to these calls. If you werent called this week, make sure you keep an eye on my social media channels for future teletown halls. I always announce them before I begin. You can follow me by clicking here for Facebook  or Twitter  , or visit my website for links. That same day, the House passed H.R. 1806  , the America COMPETES Act, by a vote of 217-205  . H.R. 1806 authorizes funding for research and education programs and grants totaling approximately $33 billion over 10 years. It reauthorizes civilian research programs in the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). This bill prioritizes basic research while staying within the caps enacted into law by the Budget Control Act. The House also passed H.R. 880  , the American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015, by a vote of 274-145  . H.R. 4438 establishes a permanent and simplified formula for calculating the research tax credit and increases this credit from six percent to ten percent. Additionally, the bill allows qualified small businesses, defined as those businesses with $50 million or less in gross receipts, to claim these tax credits against Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) liability. H.R. 880 would be effective for qualifying amounts paid and incurred after December 31, 2014. Finally, on Thursday, the House passed H.R. 2262  , the SPACE Act of 2015, by a vote of 284-133  . H.R. 2262 facilitates a pro-growth environment for the developing commercial space industry by encouraging private sector investment, creating more stable and predictable regulatory conditions, and improving safety. Specifically, the bill: reaffirms the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) ability to regulate to protect the uninvolved public in the event of an accident or unplanned event; closes loopholes that leave spaceflight participants vulnerable to financial ruin for participating in commercial human spaceflight; provides flexibility in the experimental permitting and licensing regimes to allow for rapid improvements in safety and reliability systems; and affirms Congresss commitment to the development of the commercial space industry. We capped off the week with the Salmon Salute to Veterans and Resource Clinic in Gilbert. As we enter Memorial Day weekend, its important to recognize and honor our vets for their service to our nation. The Third Annual Salmon Salute to Veterans is our chance to come together and publically appreciate their dedication and service. But its not all about words, following the salute, we arranged to have representatives of the Phoenix VA, including Director Grippen, on hand to answer questions and help vets get access to the services to which they are entitled. Thank you, once more, to all of our veterans for your dedication and service to our nation. section divider graphic Join Me On...

Throughout our nations history, veterans have contributed to the strength and resiliency of our great democracy. We must express our gratitude by ensuring that they as well as their families receive the benefits they need, deserve, and have earned. The assistance and medical treatment the Department of Veterans Affairs provides to our veterans as well as their families must always be accessible and of the highest standard. ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- WASHINGTON, DC OFFICE 2347 Rayburn HOB Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-7508 Fax: (202) 225-2947 Hours: M-F 9AM-5PM EST HOUSTON OFFICE 3003 South Loop West, Suite 460 Houston, TX 77054 Phone: 713-383-9234 Fax: 713-383-9202 Hours: M-F 9AM-5PM CST WEBSITE: UNSUBSCRIBE: PRIVACY POLICY: ",2015-01-06,9,Rep.,Representative,true,TX,al.green@congressnewsletter.net,05/26/2015,Democrat,49680,,http://algreen.house.gov,Representative for Texas's 9th congressional district,Al,RepAlGreen,,Green,G000553,202-225-7508,1947-09-01,https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/al_green/400653,RepAlGreen,,representative,1012969,Representative,2017-01-03,Rep.

[R-NC]","Richard Burr, US Senator North Carolina Last week, The Hill ran an opinion piece I wrote [link 1]about fixing education funding for low-income children. This funding inequity must be fixed for a simple reason -- when federal money is intended to assist the neediest Americans, it must actually go to that very group. Otherwise, we are shortchanging the low income students we are trying to help. Read my op-ed in full here [link 2] and more about my funding fix here [link 3]. I am also pleased to report that one of my bills is heading to the Presidents desk. On May 19, the House passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, which includesa bipartisan provision I wrote [link 4] to close a legal loophole that currently enablessome sex offenders to evade registration with the National Sex Offender Registry (NSOR). I am pleased that this legislation  which will hold convicted military sex offenders accountable -- will be signed into law. Closing this loophole is critical to preventing sex offenders from being able to recommit heinous crimes once released from the military justice system. When we know a problem exists, we cannot look the other way. Read more aboutthe Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act here [link 5]. ICYMI: The Wall Street Journal ran a good editorial on the Patriot Act [link 6]in Wednesdays paper. An untested leap to replace a framework that has been useful in the 14 years since 9/11 will make intelligence more time-consuming and less efficient. Read more here [link 7]. It was announced last week that money from the Land and Water Conservation Fund (LWCF) allowed Mulberry Creek to be added to Pisgah National Forest. LWCF is the best dollar-for-dollar conservation program Congress has ever created and has a proven track record of making good on their promise to conserve parks, open spaces, and wildlife habitats for the benefit of future generations. Check out this reporting from the Asheville Citizen-Times on the addition here [link 8].

I was grateful that we were able to work with Appropriations Committee leaders to protect and increase important funding that would not only provide for our servicemen and women but also continue to help Hawai'i's local economy. On Thursday, the Senate also unanimously passed a resolution I introduced to honor the Hui Panalaau Colonists of the Equatorial Pacific. These brave young men, the majority of whom were Native Hawaiian, battled extreme conditions to ensure that the United States could claim jurisdiction over these isolated islands in the years leading up to World War II. On Sunday, I was able to join the Pacific American Foundation at their Roll Call of Honor to pay tribute to the surviving colonists and their over 100 remarkable colleagues. As always, please contact my office in D.C. or Hawai'i if there is anything we can do. We are here to help. Mahalo, Brian Schatz U.S. Senator $444 Million for Military Construction in Hawai'i Senator Schatz, as a member of the Senate Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, worked to include $444 million for military construction projects across Hawai'i. This includes provisions for consolidation of the electric grid at Kauai's Pacific Missile Range Facility, a new Behavioral Health and Dental Clinic at Schofield Barracks, and a welding school at Pearl Harbor, among others. ""The $444 million in funding for military construction projects that the Senate Appropriations Committee approved today reflects the long-term investment that the Department of Defense is making in Hawai'i,"" said Senator Schatz. ""Hawai'i has long been recognized as an essential link to the Asia-Pacific region; and militarily, our location, training environment, and knowledge of the Asia Pacific are central to the Defense Department's strategic engagement in the region. This appropriations bill ensures that the military will have the facilities, capabilities, and infrastructure it needs to sustain Hawai'i's long-term role in the rebalance to Asia."" _____ Honoring the Hui Panalaau Colonists Last week Thursday the Senate unanimously passed a resolution honoring the Hui Panalaau colonists. This group of young men from Hawai'i aided in the establishment of United States jurisdiction over the remote islands of Howland, Baker, and Jarvis during the years leading up to and the months immediately following the bombing of Pearl Harbor. Senator Schatz joined the Pacific American Foundation at their Roll Call of Honor to give special recognition to the service, contributions, and sacrifices of the young men of Hui Panalaau. ""This is a remarkable story of humble valor, when 130 sons of Hawai'i made use of their island spirit and resourcefulness to make a very big difference for America and ultimately the free world,"" said Senator Schatz. ""It is my sincere hope that the deeds of the Hui Panalaau colonists will be more broadly shared, understood, and appreciated by the people of Hawai'i and by Americans who treasure our rich history.""  Senator Schatz with Hui Panalaau colonists George Kahanu and Retired Hawai'i Army National Guard Lt. Col. Paul Phillips at the Pacific American Foundation Roll Call of Honor More information about the Hui Panalaau colonists can be found here  . _____ Protecting Stability in the Asia-Pacific Region Senator Schatz, with Senate Armed Services Chairman John McCain (R-Arizona) and Senator Dan Sullivan (R-Alaska), introduced a resolution condemning China's construction of artificial land formations on the Spratly Islands and calling for a peaceful and multilateral resolution to the South China Sea territorial dispute. ""China's effort to unilaterally redraw the region's maritime borders exacerbates the risks of misperceptions, accidents, and conflict,"" said Senator Schatz. ""Our bipartisan resolution makes clear that China needs to act responsibly.

[R-KS3]","Congressman Kevin Yoder, Proudly Representing the 3rd District of Kansas ========================================================================= * Kansas School for the Deaf Commencement Address* [image = Click here to watch Congressman Yoder's commencement address on YouTube. [link 1] As the Co-Chair of the Congressional Deaf Caucus and a board member of Gallaudet University, I pride myself on being a champion for the deaf community. So it was an honor to be invited to give the commencement address for the 2015 graduating class from the Kansas School for the Deaf in Olathe last week. I wish I could have attended the ceremony in person, but votes in Washington unfortunately kept me in DC. Special thanks to our district office intern Renate Rose for the invitation and Steve Phan of the Office of Congressional Accessibility Services at the US Captiol for signing the speech. Congratulations, graduates! * Providing ID Cards to Veterans* [image = On Monday, with my support, the House of Representatives passed HR 91 - the Veterans ID Card Act. I was an original cosponsor of this important legislation, whichdirects the Secretary of Veterans Affairs to provide an ID card to any honorably discharged veteran. Right now, many veterans are unable to document their service without carrying around their official military service records. The problem is these forms contain sensitive personal information including social security numbers and service history, which leaves veterans at a higher, unnecessary risk for identity theft. * Country of Origin Labeling Repeal* [image = Last week, the World Trade Organization (WTO) again ruled United States country-of-origin labeling (COOL) requirements for meat are non-compliant with international trade obligations, which could lead to billions of dollars in economic retaliation by Canada and Mexico. The ruling stated that COOL unfairly discriminates against Canadian and Mexican livestock producers by requiring labels of muscle cuts of meat to state where the meat-producing animal was born, raised, and slaughtered. [image = [link 2] Click here for more information onthe WTO's [link 3] ruling and its potential impact. [link 4] COOL provides no tangible benefit to American consumers while presenting Kansas farmers, ranchers, and small business owners with a host of legal and economic problems. The U.S. Department of Agricultures Agricultural Marketing Service (AMS), which enforces COOL, has repeatedly stated that, the COOL program is neither a food safety or traceability program, but rather a consumer information program. According to AMS, the first year-incremental costs for growers, producers, processors, wholesalers, and retailers are $2.6 billion.  I commend Chairman Mike Conaway (R-TX) and the rest of the House Agriculture Committee for acting swiftly in response to last weeks World Trade Organization ruling by voting to repeal COOL. The tariffs Canada and Mexico are threatening to impose after this ruling would deal a huge blow to the Kansas economy, on top of the already added costs imposed by these unnecessary requirements.  I urge my colleagues in the House to follow the Agriculture Committees lead and take action quickly to ensure this needed fix becomes law as soon as possible. * Legislative Branch Appropriations* [image = On Wednesday, with my support, the House of Representatives passed the 2016 Legislative Branch Appropriations Bill. This bill represents a zero percent increase in spending from last year and *continues the pay freeze for Members of Congress* in existence since Republicans took control of the House in 2010.  It provides $3.34 billion for House Member offices, the support agencies of Congress, security, services for visitors, and Capitol operations and maintenance. It spends $172 million less than the President's Budget Request. - $1.18 billion for the U.S. House of Representatives - $369 million for the Capitol Police - $21 million more than 2015 level and $9.9 million less than the Presidents Budget Request - $47.3 million for the Congressional Budget Office - $495.9 million for the Architect of the Capitol - $10.1 million less than the 2015 level and $81.1 million less than the Presidents Budget Request - $591.4 million for the Library of Congress - $33.1 million less than the Presidents Budget Request - $110.2 million for the Government Publishing Office - $9.8 million less than both the 2015 level and the Presidents Budget Request - $522 million for the Government Accountability Office - $31.1 million less than the Presidents Budget Request - $1 million for Open World Leadership Center Trust Fund - $4.7 million less than the 2015 level and $7 million less than the Presidents Budget Request The money allocated in this bill allows Member offices to provide the best and most efficient service to their constituents. * Kansas Association of CPAs* [image = It was great to meet with the Kansas Society of CPAs in my DC office this afternoon to discuss the increasing complexity of the tax code and the need for comprehensive reform.

These brave men and women  and their families  are always in my prayers, especially on Memorial Day, but we shouldnt set aside just one day to give thanks to those who make sacrifices for our country. We should remember and honor our fallen, our veterans and our active duty servicemembers each and every day. Since coming to Congress in 2009, Ive had the privilege of serving on the House Committee on Veterans Affairs, where I work on behalf of veterans in East Tennessee and across the nation. My efforts over the last year, unfortunately, have been focused on getting to the bottom of the VA scandalsomething that shouldnt have ever happened. Since news broke that some veterans might have died waiting for care, my frustration and outrage with the VA has grown. This abysmal treatment of our nations heroes cannot continue, and I was proud House Speaker John Boehner (R-OH) called attention to the need for more reform at the VA last week. The speaker rightfully pointed out that only one person has been fired for their role in the waitlist scandal and that, despite receiving billions of dollars from Congress, patient wait times have not improved since the issue first came to light. This is outrageous and shameful, and we absolutely must do better. Small changes have been made, but the VA health system needs a complete overhaul. We began this work last Congress with Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act, which I was proud to support. This bill provided funding for the VA to hire more staff and created the Veterans Choice program, both of which are steps in the right direction. The Veterans Choice program has the potential to improve the care that is available to veterans by introducing competition into the VA system. It provides $10 billion for veterans who have waited for more than 30 days to see a doctor or live more than 40 miles from a VA facility to seek care outside the VA system. The same bill that funded the Choice program also included $5 billion in funding for the VA to hire more medical support staff, including doctors, so the VA should have funding available to meet their personnel needs. On May 13, I participated in a VA Committee hearing where we examined the progress of the Choice program and looked at how the VA can better reach eligible veterans. I am committed to continuing the push for systematic changes in the VA health system while ensuring the veterans that have immediate needs receive the care they earned and deserve. Its very important that Congress continue to provide oversight to the VA to ensure they are using resources wisely and running health centers around the country efficiently. Its no secret the VA is broken; its past time to fix it. Memorial Day is a reminder of the ultimate sacrifice that many have made for our nation. We should honor them and remember their families in our prayers, and we should make it a point to do better for our returning servicemembers and veterans.

""The U.S.-flagged Maersk Kensington felt threatened by Iranian Revolutionary Guard boats which circled it as it was transiting the straits,"" Stephens said. The Navy's move to accompany U.S. and United Kingdom-flagged ships through the Strait of Hormuz involved use of a wide range of service surface assets, officials said. ""We used U.S. Navy surface combatants including destroyers and coastal patrol ships. They were supported by maritime patrol and reconnaissance aircraft including P-3 surveillance planes and unmanned aircraft systems,"" Stephens added. Around the same time as the incident with the Kensington, a Marshall Islands-flagged commercial ship, the Maersk Tigris, was detained and subsequently released by Iranian authorities in the Straits. The Tigris was diverted by Iranian ships and held for several days, increasing U.S. concern about Iranian activity in the vicinity. Stephens added that there have been no incidents in recent days despite the fact that U.S. Navy ships routinely come close to Iranian vessels. ""We're maintaining a presence in the area. The Strait of Hormuz is a narrow waterway. Nearly anytime you transit you will see Iranian vessels,"" he added. Overall, the U.S. Navy currently maintains a strong presence in the 5th Fleet area of responsibility, a region which includes U.S.-led airstrikes against ISIS over Iraq and Syria as well as the ongoing conflict in Yemen. The USS Roosevelt aircraft carrier is currently in the Arabian Gulf supporting ongoing air attacks against ISIS. There are 10 coastal patrol ships permanently based in Bahrain, the headquarters of the 5th fleet. In addition, the Navy maintains an amphibious ready group and a carrier strike group in the region, Stephens said. ""We're always evaluating our force posture. Now, we are simply maintaining a robust presence in the area,"" Stephens said. The stepped up presence in the region includes additional U.S. Navy assets such as mine countermeasure ship and an amphibious ready group in Bab-el-Mandeb, the strait between Yemen and the Horn of Africa, Stephens said. Are We Really Short On Defense Spending?  Washington Post Last weeks celebrations memorializing the end of World War II in Europe should remind us that in the 70 years since victory was declared, this country has been preparing for the next great war while actually fighting smaller ones. The Dec. 7, 1941, surprise Japanese attack so embedded itself in the American psyche that avoiding another Pearl Harbor has repeatedly been a successful rallying cry for increased defense spending. The nation quickly demobilized after Japans surrender in September 1945, but defense spending began to rise in the 1950s during the Korean War, went even higher during the 1960s and 1970s for the Vietnam War and climbed again in the 1980s to meet alleged threats during the Cold War. Remember all that talk of a Soviet nuclear first strike that led to billions being spent on nuclear weapons and missile defense systems? The Sept. 11, 2001, attacks  terrorisms Pearl Harbor  justified additional spending to pay for 14 years of fighting in Afghanistan and Iraq and against terrorists worldwide. In short, the United States has been preparing for war or been at war for at least two generations. There are threats out there. Gen. Martin Dempsey, chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, said Wednesday at a hearing of the Senate Appropriations subcommittee on defense that the situation today is the most uncertain security environment that I have experienced in 40 years. Note, however, that he said the threats were the most uncertain, not the most dangerous to this nations survival. There is no axis of Nazi Germany and Imperial Japan attempting to conquer the world or a nuclear-armed Soviet Union seeking to spread communism. Dempsey talked of Russias threat to Europe, Iran and its nuclear program, North Korea, a rising China and non-state actors such as the Islamic State, al-Qaeda and aligned terrorist groups. These state and non-state actors, Dempsey said, For the first time in my career, they are both manifesting themselves simultaneously. The Joint Chiefs chairman, making probably his last Capitol Hill appearance to testify on a defense budget, said, We are at a point where our global aspirations are exceeding our available resources. Hes right  but that also depends on how you determine whats needed to fulfill those aspirations. A significant part of the current fiscal 2015 core defense budget of $490.2 billion goes to pay for deterring major threats and the big war  i.e., Russia and China. The overall U.S. defense budget is roughly twice the combined amounts those countries were reported spending in 2014  China at $136 billion and Russia at $81 billion. When it comes to deterring those countries, the United States is far ahead in major conventional and nuclear weapons, while all three countries are building more advanced ones. Do we need them all? For example, at Wednesdays hearing, Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-Calif.) said she favored spending $1.2 billion to develop a new long-range stealth bomber designed to penetrate an enemys airspace and deliver a nuclear weapon. But she questioned spending $1.8 billion for a new air-launched, nuclear-capable cruise missile for that bomber that could be launched a thousand or more miles from the target. Feinstein pointed out the missile was only half the true cost. Another $1.8 billion would be needed to pay for the Energy Department to extend the life of the W-80 nuclear warhead needed for the new missile. I question why we need this cruise missile that can deliver nuclear warheads from great distances in addition to the numerous gravity bombs, submarine-launch ballistic missiles and intercontinental ballistic missiles weve armed ourselves with, Feinstein said. Dempsey responded that air defenses are improving around the world and that keeping that capability to penetrate air defenses with our nuclear deterrent is an important one. Then there are the additional billions the United States spends through the Pentagons Overseas Contingency Operations (OCO) account, which pays for fighting in Iraq, Afghanistan, Syria and elsewhere against terrorists. Its an added $64 billion this year and could go higher next year, depending on Congress. Congress has transferred some core Pentagon spending to the OCO account, since the latter doesnt count against budget caps. The recently passed, Republican-driven fiscal 2016 budget resolution includes a whopping $96 billion in the OCO account, $38 billion above the amount requested by President Obama. Defense Secretary Ashton B. Carter last week called that approach a road to nowhere since OCO funds are meant to meet temporary costs and the core defense items need multi-year budgeting stability. Carter and Dempsey also cautioned senators about the idea of setting up a humanitarian no-fly zone in Syria. It would end up being a major military operation, they said, and very costly. We would need to fight to create such a space and then fight to keep such a space, Carter said, describing it as a major combat mission. Dempsey noted the irony about talking about doing more in the world when the Pentagon was already facing a tight budget and the threat of further sequestration cuts. Carter Appoints Richardson As CNO In an unprecedented move, Defense Secretary Ash Carter has nominated a submariner, Adm. John Richardson, to succeed another member of the ""silent service"" as the 31st chief of naval operations. Richardson currently serves as the naval nuclear propulsion program director. He also led the 2014 investigation of the service's Naval Nuclear Power School cheating scandal when 34 sailors were expelled. If approved by Congress, Richardson would succeed another fellow submariner, Adm. Jonathan Greenert, and take the helm at the time the service wants to fund the multibillion-dollar Ohio-class replacement ballistic missile submarine program. White House Whacks House GOP's Plan For Cruiser Modernization  Inside Defense The White House this week slammed the Republican-led House Armed Services Committee's plan for the Navy's cruiser modernization program, asserting the new restrictions would erase millions of dollars in planned cost savings and force the ships into early retirement. ""The Administration strongly objects to the Committee's restrictions on the Department's plan to modernize its Ticonderoga Class Cruisers,"" according to an Office of Management and Budget statement  released late Tuesday. ""The Committee's provision would erase planned savings of $300 million to $400 million, result in early depletion of Ship Modernization, Operations and Sustainment Fund funds, and accelerate the retirement of the cruisers."" The committee late last month endorsed a ""Two-Two-Six"" plan to reduce the term of cruiser availabilities from four years to just two, rejecting concerns expressed by the chief of naval operations and an influential Democrat on the panel that the new approach to phased modernization will delay the upgrades and eliminate cost savings. ""Two-Two-Six"" is a shift from the ""Two-Four-Six"" plan mandated by the FY-15 National Defense Authorization Act, which would allow the Navy to place two ships in reduced operating status each year, for no more than four years at a time, and would limit the number of cruisers out of service all at once to six. During its mark-up of the FY-16 defense authorization bill April 29, the panel defeated an amendment introduced by Ranking Member Joe Courtney (D-CT) that would have blocked the seapower and projection forces subcommittee's ""Two-Two-Six"" proposal. In defeating Courtney's amendment, the panel soundly rejected CNO Adm. Jonathan Greenert's concerns, expressed in an April 28 letter to committee Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-TX). The proposed two-year availability period does not support manpower reductions, one area in which the Navy had hoped to realize cost savings, Greenert noted. The proposal would deplete the SMOSF more than one year early, result in retirement of the Ticonderoga-class cruisers three years ahead of schedule, and delay induction of the Chosin (CG-65) and the Vicksburg (CG-69) into the program from FY-16 until FY-19. The White House also criticized a provision in the bill that restricts the Navy's plan to remove ballistic missile defense capability from the cruisers. Maintaining this capability on cruisers, which are meant for a primarily anti-air warfare mission, will prevent scheduled combat systems upgrades, increase overall modernization costs and delay the upgrades, according to the OMB statement. The Navy plans to upgrade the combat systems of its Aegis cruisers during phased modernization, but the Aegis baseline planned for the cruisers, Baseline 9A, does not include BMD capability. The House panel would prohibit the Navy from stripping the missile defense capabilities of the cruisers until the service certifies to the congressional defense committees that it has met the BMD requirements of the most recent Navy Force Structure Assessment, or decides to upgrade the ships with an ""equal or improved"" BMD capability. The White House is threatening to veto the measure altogether, primarily because it seeks to skirt sequestration cuts by adding money to the Pentagon's supplemental warfighting account Fort Worth Completes South China Sea Patrol  Navy News Service SUBIC BAY, Republic of the Philippines  Littoral combat ship USS Fort Worth (LCS 3) arrived here to resupply May 13 after a weeklong routine patrol in international waters and airspace of the South China Sea near the Spratly Islands. While Fort Worth has transited the South China Sea many times, this patrol marks the first time an LCS has operated in international waters near the Spratlys. ""As part of our strategic rebalance to bring our newest and most capable Navy platforms to the Indo-Asia-Pacific, LCS now has a regular presence in Southeast Asia,"" said Capt. Fred Kacher, commodore, Destroyer Squadron (DESRON) 7. ""Routine operations like the one Fort Worth just completed in the South China Sea will be the new normal as we welcome four LCSs to the region in the coming years. Deployment of multiple LCSs to Southeast Asia underscores the importance of this 'region on the rise' and the value persistent presence brings."" Fort Worth is the second LCS to deploy to U.S. 7th Fleet as part of an initiative to simultaneously deploy up to four LCS to the Indo-Asia-Pacific region in just a few years. The third and fourth LCSs are planned to arrive in 2016, when the region will see two of these ships deployed at the same time. Fort Worth is also the first LCS to deploy under the ""3-2-1"" manning concept, which allows LCS to sustain a 16-month rotational presence without fatiguing the crew during the extended deployment, which is twice as long as typical U.S. Navy ship deployments. It is named 3-2-1 because three rotational crews will support two LCS ships, one of which is deployed. Future LCS deployments to the region will employ this concept, allowing for enhanced U.S. Navy presence throughout the Indo-Asia-Pacific. While operating in international waters and airspace near the Spratly's, Fort Worth conducted flight operations with its MQ-8B Fire Scout unmanned aircraft system and MH-60R Seahawk helicopter. Fort Worth encountered multiple People's Liberation Army-Navy [PLA(N)] warships, each time taking the opportunity to use the Code for Unplanned Encounters at Sea (CUES). ""Just like our first meeting in February with a PLA(N) warship, guided-missile frigate Hengshui (FFG 572), our interactions with Chinese ships continue to be professional and CUES helps clarify intentions and prevent miscommunication,"" said Cmdr. Matt Kawas, Fort Worth Crew 103 commanding officer. Pentagon Recommends Nuclear Director To Be Next Navy Chief  Associated Press WASHINGTON  The Pentagon is recommending that Adm. John Richardson, head of the Navy's nuclear program, be named the next chief of naval operations, U.S. officials said Tuesday. If confirmed by the Senate, Richardson would be the second submariner in a row to serve as the Navy's top officer. Adm. Jonathan Greenert, the current Navy chief, also spent much of his career serving as a submarine officer. Defense Secretary Ash Carter is expected to make the announcement Wednesday, and will also disclose who he is recommending as the next chief of staff of the Army. A number of senior officers have been discussed as leading candidates for the Army job, including Gen. John Campbell, the top commander in Afghanistan; Gen. Lloyd Austin, the top commander for the Middle East; Gen. Curtis Scaparrotti, commander of U.S. forces in Korea; and Gen. Vincent Brooks, commander of Army forces in the Pacific. Other names include Gen. Dan Allyn, the vice chief of the Army and Gen. David Perkins, who heads U.S. Army Training and Doctrine Command. The officials were not authorized to publicly discuss the nomination ahead of the announcement so spoke on condition of anonymity. Richardson is a 1982 graduate of the U.S. Naval Academy with a degree in physics, and he also holds a master's degree from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. He has served as director of the Navy's nuclear reactors program since November 2012, and his choice signals the military's continued emphasis on undersea warfare and nuclear deterrence. One official said Richardson has a reputation in the Navy as an analytical strategic thinker, and that he is expected to continue to make the planned nuclear submarine replacement program a top priority. Last year, Richardson ordered a broad investigation into allegations that a cheating ring had operated undetected for at least seven years at a nuclear power training site. Nearly three dozen sailors were kicked out of the program after the Navy discovered they were cheating on qualification exams. They were seeking to become qualified as instructors at the nuclear training unit in Charleston, South Carolina. Students there are trained in nuclear reactor operations to prepare for service on any of the Navy's 83 nuclear-powered submarines and aircraft carriers. In an interview with The Associated Press last August, Richardson said he was ""loaded for bear"" early on in the investigation, because he wasn't convinced the cheating was confined to a single training unit. But he later came to believe it hadn't spread, which helped the cheating go undetected for so long. During the probe, Richardson met with each of the accused and said he heard at least two common themes: a belief that there was little risk of getting caught, and a work environment at the nuclear training site that created stresses and pressures on the instructors. He said he was taking steps to ease the pressures and to strengthen ethics training. Carter has had a number of senior level vacancies to fill. Gen. Joe Dunford has been nominated as the next chairman of the joint chiefs, which opens up his current job as commandant of the Marine Corps. Following the brief stop for fuel in the Philippines, Fort Worth will return to Singapore for the International Maritime Defense Exhibition and Conference (IMDEX) 2015 just ahead of the second crew swap in late May. Throughout the summer and fall, Fort Worth will take part in most of the 2015 CARAT exercise series. In its 21st year, CARAT is an annual, bilateral exercise series with the U.S. Navy, U.S. Marine Corps and the armed forces of nine partner nations including, Bangladesh, Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Republic of the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Timor-Leste. During February and March, Fort Worth participated in the annual U.S.-Republic of Korea exercise Foal Eagle and conducted a maintenance availability in Sasebo, Japan, expanding LCS' operational reach to Northeast Asia for the first time. Following the availability, Fort Worth returned to Southeast Asia where she took part in the sixth-annual Naval Engagement (NEA) Vietnam with the Vietnam People's Navy (VPN) in April, spending a day operating at-sea with the VPN. ""We've made great strides in terms of LCS' operational potential in a short period of time,"" said Kacher. ""With the regular and routine presence of LCS here, we are far better able to spend the time and resources required to build regional maritime capacity, helping to achieve the 'Network of Navies' outlined in the Navy's newly-released maritime strategy."" Fast, agile and mission-focused, littoral combat ships are designed to operate in near-shore environments and employ modular mission packages that can be configured for surface warfare, mine countermeasures or anti-submarine warfare. Fort Worth will employ the surface warfare (SUW) mission package for her entire deployment, augmenting her 57mm gun and rolling airframe missile launcher with two 30mm guns, two 11-meter rigid-hull inflatable boats, and two six-member maritime security boarding teams. Enhancing the SUW mission package is the embarked aviation detachment from Helicopter Maritime Squadron (HSM) 35, the Navy's first composite expeditionary helicopter squadron, which consists of one Sea Hawk helicopter and one Fire Scout. The U.S. 7th Fleet conducts forward-deployed naval operations in support of U.S. national interests in the Indo-Asia-Pacific area of operations. As the U.S. Navy's largest numbered fleet, U.S. 7th Fleet interacts with 35 other maritime nations to build partnerships that foster maritime security, promote stability and prevent conflict.

,114,Male,N00009154,43313,"Goodlatte, Bob (Rep.) [R-VA6]"," Rep. Bob Goodlatte As we celebrate Memorial Day this weekend, I encourage you to remember those who have served and thank those who continue to stand guard over our nation today. May God bless our troops and may He continue to bless the United States of America. Remembering the sacrifice, honoring the service The land of the free and home of the brave - while the words of our National Anthem were penned over 200 years ago, this time-honored phrase rightly describes this great nation we call home today. America's history has been cemented by the brave men and women who have fought tirelessly to defend it from threats both at home and on battlefields in distant lands. Memorial Day is a time to remember the sacrifices of the men and women of our Armed Forces. Many have made the ultimate sacrifice by giving their life in defense of our freedoms as Americans. They are the sons, daughters, mothers, fathers, and friends who we will never forget. While nothing we do can repay the cost these men and women have paid or take away the grief their families and loved ones have experienced, it is our duty to honor their service by ensuring that America remains true to the principles upon which it was founded. Recently, the House of Representatives passed the National Defense Authorization Act, which provides the necessary resources for a strong national defense to make certain the U.S. military is ready and capable to defend our liberties. This bipartisan legislation improves troop and military family benefits while also taking steps to reduce waste and ensure that our defense programs are operating efficiently. The House also passed several bills to provide additional support for veterans. The Veteran's I.D. Card Act would create a new I.D. card for veterans to document their service instead of carrying around official service records, which contain sensitive personal information and may put them at risk of identity theft. Another bill, the Ensuring VA Accountability Act, would hold VA employees responsible for their conduct. The House also reauthorized the Homeless Veteran Re-Integration Program, which would make grants available for job training programs to community organizations that serve homeless veterans. To say you are an American is much more than a confession of your nationality or culture. It shouldn't just explain your country of citizenship or where your roots are planted. To say you are an American should carry the same weight that it did for our Founding Fathers. We will fight for freedom, we will preserve liberty, and we will remain united together, despite the odds, to pursue that dream. No one knows this better than the many men and women who have met that calling with their lives - they are our best, our bravest, and on this Memorial Day, we remember them. VIDEO: Goodlatte Urges the Senate to Pass the USA Freedom Act - I joined CNN's New Day on the USA Freedom Act, which passed the House 338-88, and why the Senate should pass it immediately. Watch it here. Roanoke Student's Artwork Headed to the U.S. Capitol Congratulations to Kayla Prillaman, a senior at William Fleming High School in Roanoke. This week, I announced that Kayla is the winner of the Sixth District's Congressional Art Competition for her photograph, Autumn Trails. We are blessed to be surrounded by so much natural beauty in the Sixth District, and Autumn Trails truly captures the beauty of the landscape that draws many to our region each year. Kayla's eye for photography shines clearly in this photo. I am pleased that her piece will be on display in the U.S. Capitol to allow others the opportunity to experience what we have right in our backyard. The talent of our students in the Sixth District is always impressive, and I applaud the efforts of each student who submitted artwork this year.

[R-NC3]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email   Dear Friend, As we observe Memorial Day and reflect on the sacrifices our men and women in the military have made to keep our country free, I would like to update you on my work in Congress to make sure our veterans receive the benefits they earned and the quality, timely care they deserve. One of my most important duties representing the third district in Congress is to advocate for service members and veterans. When it was reported  last month that veterans are experiencing some of the worst wait times in the country at the Jacksonville clinic, I wrote  to the Veterans Administration (VA) to demand an explanation and a plan to address the problem. The VA followed up and last week I met with Jan Murphy, Acting Deputy Under Secretary for Operations and Management at the VA, and three of her colleagues. They explained that excessive wait times to see a primary care physician at the Jacksonville clinic are due to increased patient demand coupled with a space-constrained facility and limited staffing. However, they reported that a new, 15,000 square foot clinic will be opening up in Jacksonville at the end of the summer, supported by two medical teams. The two additional medical teams at the new Jacksonville clinic will be able to serve 2,400 more veterans. They also reported that the VA has expanded hours at clinics nationwide to accommodate veterans who work during the day and are only able to see a doctor early in the morning, late in the evening, or on Sunday. While the Deputy Under Secretary's plan of action to reduce wait times in Jacksonville is encouraging, I will continue to hold the VA accountable for providing timely, quality service to veterans in Jacksonville and throughout Eastern North Carolina. I also continue to do everything I can for veterans through the legislative process. Over the last two and a half years, I have cosponsored more bills to help veterans than any member of Congress  . Just this past week, the House passed six bills to hold the VA accountable and ensure veterans get the benefits they earned: * H.R. 1382, The Boosting Rates of American Veteran Employment Act * H.R. 1313, The Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Relief Act * H.R. 1038, The Ensuring VA Employee Accountability Act * H.R. 474, The Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Programs Reauthorization Act of 2015 * H.R. 91, The Veteran's ID Card Act * H.R. 1816, the Vulnerable Veterans Housing Reform Act of 2015. I hope you will join me this weekend in remembering the true meaning of Memorial Day. Since our founding, tens of thousands of this nation's best and brightest have made the ultimate sacrifice.

They are separated from their families for long lengths of time and are asked to perform dangerous and selfless tasks. However, on Memorial Day each year we take time to pause and recognize the members of our Armed Forces who have made the ultimate sacrifice and given their lives in service our nation. In recent years, our nation has ended our war in Iraq and is nearing the end of our longest conflict in Afghanistan. The war in Iraq took the lives of 68 brave Minnesota soldiers and the conflict in Afghanistan cost us another 29 Minnesota lives. These women and men were our friends, family members, and neighbors. We owe their families and their loved ones the utmost gratitude and support. For generations to come Americans will honor the commitment and dedication of the women and men who serve in the United States military. All of those who have served in our Armed Forces deserve our respect and most sincere gratitude. On Memorial Day we take time to honor those who gave their lives in service on those critical missions and recognize the sacrifice they have made. My thoughts and prayers are with all of those in Minnesota who are mourning the loss of a friend, family member or loved one this Memorial Day. . THE NEED TO INVEST IN TRANSPORTATION This week, Congress voted to extend the Highway Trust Fund for another two months of funding. Traditionally, the Highway Trust Fund has been funded over the long-term and used to support construction projects on roads, bridges and other forms of surface transportation around the country. I was disappointed that a brief two month extension was all that we were able to pass. I voted in favor of the bill, but my preference would be that important investments in our nation's infrastructure be funded over the long-term so that these projects can have the certainty and stability they need. This is an issue that hard-working Americans in the labor community support, as well as those in the business community who understand the importance of infrastructure to our economy. With this kind of agreement from American citizens, it is a shame that Congress cannot come together on a long-term agreement as well. HONORING ASIAN-PACIFIC HERITAGE MONTH May is Asian-Pacific Heritage month, where we take time to honor the contributions that Asian Americans and Pacific Islanders have made to our nation's society, culture, and history. In Minnesota, the successes of Asian-Americans have made within the arts, business and public service are truly critical to our state. Leaders like former State Senator Mee Moua, who was the first Hmong woman elected to a legislature in the country, have been instrumental in helping our state grow and succeed. The achievements and stories of the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities are of great importance to Minnesota and it is important that we take time this month to acknowledge those contributions to our state.

[R-TX11]","May 22, 2015 Conaway Chronicle: Introducing Legislation to Lift the Oil Export Ban, Giving Back to Service Members, Celebrating 24 Years __________________________________________ Thank you for reading The Conaway Chronicle, a review of my activities in Congress. Introducing Legislation to Lift the Oil Export Ban This week, I announced the introduction of H.R 2369, the Energy Supply and Distribution Act of 2015, which will lift the oil export ban. The 40 year ban on oil exports is out of date and out of touch with Americas thriving energy industry. At the time the ban was introduced, it served a purpose  to keep our oil at home in order to reduce our exposure to the wildly fluctuating markets of the 1970s. Today, the ban has outlived that purpose and has become an antiquated policy that is now only harming Americans. We have an abundance of oil here in the U.S., and lifting the oil export ban will create jobs, spur economic growth, and strengthen our national security interests. I look forward to working with my many colleagues who support this legislation to ensure that we are no longer stuck in the 1970s when it comes time to our nations energy policy. H.R. 2369 is the companion legislation for Senator Lisa Murkowskis bill to lift the oil export ban, S. 1312. Giving Back to Service Members Wednesday, I took part in a USO event to assemble care packages for deployed servicemembers. As a member of the USO Congressional Caucus, I really enjoy events like this that give us a chance to remind our men and women in the military that we are thinking about them and praying for them as they sacrifice so much to protect our nation. Celebrating 24 Years On Monday, Suzanne and I will celebrate our 24th wedding anniversary. Here's a throwback picture from our wedding day! I am so thankful to Suzanne for all the love and support she's given me over the years. I truly would not be where I am today without her.

[R-NE3]","  Home  Serving You  Issues  Newsroom  Contact Adrian  About the District  About Adrian  Weekly E-newsletter - May 22, 2015 Video of the Week:   This week I spoke on the House floor to remember and honor Captain Dustin Lukasiewicz of Alma. Click the image above for video of my remarks. E-news: Honoring Nebraskans' Service and Sacrifice Nebraskas Third District has a long tradition of military service. During the week leading up to Memorial Day, we honored two local heroes from different generations who displayed extraordinary valor and an unyielding commitment to our country. Captain Dustin Lukasiewicz of Alma was one of six Marines killed in a helicopter crash on May 12th while providing humanitarian aid to earthquake victims in Nepal. He graduated from Wilcox-Hildreth High School and had previously deployed to Afghanistan. In addition to being a dedicated Marine, Captain Lukasiewicz was a devoted son, husband and father. He and his wife have one daughter and a second child on the way. When I spoke with Captain Lukasiewiczs mother this week, she told me how her son went out of his way to give her a call from Nepal on Mothers Day  just two days before the crash. During their talk, Captain Lukasiewicz excitedly described a video the Marine Corps had just produced about their mission. The video ends with him stating, My name is Captain Lukasiewicz, and we stand with Nepal. His work on behalf of victims across the world and the thoughtful call on his mothers special day exemplify his devotion to the care of others. Captain Lukasiewiczs legacy of service is now forever enshrined on screen and will not be forgotten. While honoring one brave soldiers sacrifice, we also paid tribute to another Nebraska hero in Washington, D.C. Donald McPherson of Adams was one of 77 American Fighter Aces presented with the Congressional Gold Medal at a ceremony in the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, May 20th. Ensign McPherson is one of two surviving World War II fighter aces in Nebraska. These brave pilots earned the title of fighter aces by shooting down at least five enemies in battle. Ensign McPherson earned three Distinguished Flying Crosses and four Air Medals while assigned to fighter squadron VF-83 aboard the U.S.S. Essex in the Pacific. In his F6F Hellcat, he directly faced our enemies in the skies to defend our country and preserve our liberty. Following the Congressional Gold Medal ceremony, I had the opportunity to thank Ensign McPherson and present him with a copy of the Congressional Record recognizing his service. When asked about his experiences, the humility Ensign McPherson displays is striking. He embodies the selflessness of a true hero. In addition to Captain Lukasiewicz and Ensign McPherson, thousands of Nebraskans have answered the call to serve their country. At the end of the month, I will have the honor of attending the send-off ceremony for soldiers of the Nebraska National Guard. We pray for our men and women currently serving in our Armed Forces and thank them for representing the greatness of America. Words cannot express our gratitude for their dedication to keeping our homeland safe. Memorial Day is set aside each year to remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice, but we should remain mindful of our military men and women every day. The stories of these selfless heroes, including Captain Lukasiewicz and Ensign McPherson, must be told and their legacies protected for future generations to understand the true cost of freedom. Meet with me next week On May 26 and May 29, I will host mobile offices in Nebraska's Third District. I hope you will be able to come and talk with me.

[R-WV1]","David McKinley, Proudly Representing the 1st District of West Virginia *Working on the Highway* In the House this week, we passed a short-term funding bill to ensure highway construction in West Virginia would continue through the end of July. This short-term Band-Aid is not enough. After a rough winter, our roads have never been worse. It is more important than ever Congress reach a long-term solution to funding their portion of the highways and interstates so integral to rural areas. This week the states Blue Ribbon Commission on Highways released its report detailing the needs of our highway system and how to best fund it. I look forward to reading through this report and discussing with state officials how the Congress can be a productive partner with West Virginia. Our roads and bridges are an integral part of our economy. Without the infrastructure to support manufacturing and commerce, well see fewer jobs and fewer companies moving into West Virginia. We need certainty our roads will be in good condition and serving the needs of the First District. *Finding a Cure for Alzheimers* In the Energy & Commerce Committee this week, we discussed the priorities for research at the National Institutes of Health (NIH), the federal governments primary health science office. As you can see in the video below, Chairman Upton and I agree Alzheimers deserves our full attention and funding. Millions of families dealing with the pain of Alzheimers could benefit from increased research, better treatments, and progress toward a cure. [image = air.PNG] [link 1] On Thursday, we visited the NIH to make the case in person and to discuss research programs that could come to West Virginia University with NIH Director Frances Collins [image = Director 5-21-15.JPG] *Protecting Pensions for Coal Miners* There are 130,000 coal miners and retirees whose pensions and healthcare benefits are threatened by difficulties in the coal industry. Over the last four years, my office has worked with these retirees to shore up these funds. Without a solution, these pension obligations could fall to the American taxpayer and jeopardize the pensions of millions of others. My legislation, introduced on Monday, will put excess funds from the Abandoned Mine Land Fund, which is funded by coal revenue, towards shoring up retirement benefits for these retirees. *Congratulations, Graduates!* Last weekend I had the honor of addressing the graduates at WVU-Parkersburg. Drawing from a sermon delivered more than twenty years ago, I encouraged these young men and women to seek their dreams and be true to themselves. You can read more about it here. In Morgantown, at WVUs main campus, 94-year-old Anthony Brutto received his degree, more than seven decades after first enrolling there before World War Two. We entered a congratulatory note to him in the Congressional Record this week, which can be viewed here [link 2]. * [image = *Honoring Our American Fighter Aces* My great uncle, Louie Bennett, Jr., flew in World War One, downing 9 enemy hot-air balloons (used for surveying the battlefield in that war) in 25 sorties. Though his flying career only lasted nine days before he was shot down and killed, he earned the title of Ace, given only to those who score five or more aerial victories in combat. He is the only World War One Ace from West Virginia. On Thursday, Uncle Louie and scores of veterans were recognized with the Congressional Gold Medal, the highest honor Congress awards. It was a unique pleasure to attend and honor my relative.

Serrano was presented with the CDFI Congressional Champion Award by the Opportunity Finance Network for his work in support of Community Development Financial Institutions (CDFIs) and the financial empowerment of low-income individuals and communities. Rep. Ander Crenshaw (R-Fla.), Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), and Sen. Dick Durbin (D-Ill.) were also presented with the award this year. ""As both Chairman and Ranking Member of the Financial Services and General Government Appropriations Subcommittee, I have consistently made it a priority to increase funding for the CDFI Fund for one simple reason  CDFIs fill a void in financial services and deliver tangible results to underserved communities all across the nation , said Congressman Serrano. CDFIs are crucial in places like the Bronx and their investments have spurred economic development, made it possible for many to buy their first home or start their business, and helped finance the creation of important community housing and health care facilities. It's an honor to receive the CDFI Congressional Champion Award, and I will continue supporting these important institutions in Congress.  Congressman Serrano (center) stands with Lori Chatman, President of the Enterprise Community Loan Fund (left) and Mark Pinsky, President and CEO of the Opportunity Finance Network (right) after receiving the 2015 CDFI Congressional Champion Award. (5/19/2015) Crowley, Serrano Announce House Approval of Bipartisan Measure to Expand Access to STEM Fields for Hispanic Students On Wednesday, the U.S. House of Representatives passed a bipartisan amendment to the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act calling for expanding access to science, technology, engineering, and mathematics (STEM) education at Hispanic Serving Institutions (HSIs) of higher education. The amendment was offered by Reps. Joe Crowley (D-Queens, the Bronx), Vice Chair of the Democratic Caucus, and Jos E. Serrano (D-the Bronx), as well as Ben Ray Lujn (D-NM), Will Hurd (R-TX), and Carlos Curbelo (R-FL). The amendment requires the National Science Foundation (NSF) to establish a grant program to support undergraduate STEM education at HSIs. Encouraging underrepresented minorities, such as Hispanic students, to enter STEM fields is crucial for our country to remain competitive in todays global economy. The amendment is the latest move in the longstanding effort to establish this program, including recent legislation introduced by Serrano, Crowley, and Lujn in April. As the largest minority in our nation, we need to ensure that Hispanics have the opportunity and are prepared to take the STEM jobs of tomorrow. Right now, far too few Hispanics enter these important fields of study in college. By creating a specific stream of funding for Hispanic Serving Institutions, this amendment will help expand opportunities for Hispanic students in the STEM fields. STEM is vital for the United States global competitiveness, and the only way we can guarantee that our country will continue leading the way is by investing in the education of our future generations, said Serrano. Congressman Serrano Adds Amendments to CJS Appropriations Bill On Wednesday, the House Appropriations Committee marked up the fiscal year 2016 Commerce, Justice, Science Appropriations bill. As a senior member of the Committee, Serrano included two changes at the markup that improve the overall legislation, and worked tirelessly to point out and address other issues throughout the appropriations process. The first change restores funding to a program that is part of President Obamas efforts to address problems between local police and the communities they serve. The program, entitled Collaborative Reform, provides assistance to communities to review local police practices, recommend reforms, create a space for discussion between the police and the communities they serve, and build trust between both sides. The second change dedicates $1 million in funding to ensure that information desks are available at our nation's busiest immigration courts to provide individuals going through deportation proceedings with information, legal advice, and referral to legal counsel. This will improve the fairness of our immigration court system, where far too many must face a deportation proceeding without a lawyer or even a basic understanding of the process. ""I was glad to include these provisions in the legislation that passed out of committee, said Serrano. Although I still have some serious concerns about this legislation, this additional funding will help address issues of basic fairness and justice that are important to the Bronx. As this bill moves through the process, I will continue to work to restore funding to the Legal Services Corporation and other programs that are vital to New Yorkers. The legislation now moves to the full House of Representatives for further consideration. Congressman Serrano Celebrates Head Starts 50th Anniversary On Monday, Congressman Jos E. Serrano released the following statement in celebration of Head Starts 50th Anniversary: Over 30 million working families have been able to send their children to preschool and take better care of them thanks to Head Starts work during the past five decades. All throughout the nation, Head Start programs provide children with the foundation they need to succeed in school and later on in life. Their work is crucial in the Bronx, where countless families and children have benefited over the years from the dedicated staff and teachers who work with them on a daily basis. Last year alone, more than 5,600 people in the Bronx were served by a Head Start program. Unfortunately, the Republican budget plans to cut more funds from Head Start, threatening its ability to continue providing services to our neediest families. Congress needs to protect funding for Head Start and guarantee that all of our children have access to a well-rounded education from an early age. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I will continue fighting to ensure this important program is properly funded."" Grants _____ New Pathways for Fathers and Families Deadline: July 7, 2015 The Department of Health and Human Services has made funding available through the Administration for Children and Families for the New Pathways for Fathers and Families program, which aims to support activities promoting responsible fatherhood as enacted by the Claims Resolution Act of 2010. This initiative is designed to help fathers establish or strengthen positive parental interaction by providing activities that develop and improve relationship, communication and parenting skills, and contribute to the financial well-being of their children by providing job training and other employment services. States (including state, territorial, and tribal institutions of higher education), territories, Native American tribes and tribal organizations, and public and nonprofit community entities (including religious organizations and public and private nonprofit institutions of higher education) are encouraged to apply.

Since 9/11 more than 6,800 American service members  including 250 sons and daughters of Illinois  have paid the ultimate sacrifice serving our country in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And even as Americas military involvement in those conflicts winds down, American service members continue to risk  and give  their lives to help others around the globe. Earlier this month, Marine Corporal Sara Medina died, along with five fellow Marines, while providing humanitarian relief to the people of Nepal after their terrible earthquake. Corporal Medina was from Aurora, Illinois. She was 23 years old. She was looking forward to coming home this summer to marry a fellow Marine. Memorial Day is about remembering and honoring the sacrifices of all our fallen heroes. We can fulfill that obligation by making sure that our troops today have the best training, the best equipment, and the best protection this nation can provide  and by honoring our sacred pledge to take care of the servicemen and women who do come home. So as we celebrate warmer weather and spend time with family and friends this weekend, let us all remember what this day is really about: honoring the lives of those we have lost. To those who have made that sacrifice, and to their loved ones: thank you. Happy Memorial Day.

In Georgia, 1.2 million jobs are directly related to international trade. Last year alone, Georgia's farmers, manufacturers, and companies exported $39.4 billion worth of goods around the globe. Passing responsible trade promotion legislation would further benefit American workers and promote American jobs by setting out clear objectives mandated by Congress that the president must achieve in international trade agreements. Under this legislation, Congress retains the authority to either approve the agreement, or to determine that the agreement will not benefit the United States and to vote it down. Protecting National Security The Senate also debated the reauthorization of a critical national security program that has served as a proven intelligence tool in fighting terrorists since it was first passed by Congress in 2001. Protecting both national security and personal privacy are paramount responsibilities for the U.S. Congress. The threats around the world and even on U.S. soil are growing at an alarming rate. These strong security measures ensure that the intelligence gaps identified by the 9/11 Commission Report would never prove to be vulnerabilities to our national security ever again. We need to send a clear message to ISIL and all others who intend to harm us that we stand here to preserve and protect, and we will not let any obstacle stop our pursuit of those who seek to destroy our freedoms. Denver VA Hospital As chairman of the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee, I spent a lot of time this week working on the construction and management debacle in the VA's project to build a new hospital in Denver. To date, the VA has failed to demonstrate any leadership or hold accountable those responsible for the nearly $1 billion-over-budget Denver VA project  the biggest construction failure in VA history. We are caught between a rock and a hard place. Construction is scheduled to stop on May 24, 2015, and the cost of stopping and restarting construction could be as high as an additional $200 million for the American taxpayer. As of this writing, the Senate was trying to pass a short-term extension to allow VA to use resources it already has to keep construction crews on the job. We expect the VA and the Obama administration to accept responsibility for what this is  an outright financial and management disaster of catastrophic proportions  and to return immediately to the critical task of developing a workable plan to fully fund and complete the Denver VA medical center. Listening to Our Veterans On Wednesday, the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs was joined by the House Committee on Veterans' Affairs to hear from multiple Veteran Service Organizations about their legislative priorities for the year. I want to thank the Paralyzed Veterans of America, AMVETS National Headquarters, Military Order of the Purple Heart, USA, Military Officers Association of America, Vietnam Veterans of America, Blinded Veterans Association, Iraq and Afghanistan Veterans of America and NCOA USA for testifying.  You can watch my opening statement and questions at Wednesday's hearing here  . Improving Medicare for Chronic Health Conditions Last week, the Senate Committee on Finance held a hearing on improving Medicare for senior citizens and people with disabilities who have been diagnosed with multiple chronic conditions. The prevalence of conditions such as heart disease, diabetes, and cancer has grown significantly since Medicare was created in 1965, yet aspects of the program have not been updated to reflect the importance of coordinating medical care to help these patients stay out of the hospital. To follow up on this hearing, I am co-chairing a bipartisan working group with Senator Mark Warner of Virginia to explore ways to strengthen Medicare's coverage of chronic conditions and empower health care providers and patients to develop innovative health solutions that save money without compromising quality. What's on Tap? I hope that everyone has a safe and enjoyable Memorial Day weekend. Please take a moment this weekend to remember our brave warriors and their families  . Our fallen soldiers were patriotic men and women with a great sense of duty, and they made the ultimate sacrifice in seeking to protect our liberties and freedoms. We will never be able to repay the tremendous debt we owe to those who proudly served our country with honor. You can also watch me on C-SPAN's Newsmakers this Sunday, May 24, 2015, at 10:00 a.m. ET or at 6:00 p.m. ET. I'll be discussing the importance of taking care of our country's veterans and reforming the culture of the Department of Veterans Affairs so that tragedies like last year's wait time scandal at the VA hospital in Phoenix never happen again.

[R-MI1]","News from Representative Benishek  May 22, 2015 Dear Friend, As we approach the Memorial Day weekend, it is important to remember the reason for this holiday. Across American history, hundreds of thousands of men and women have paid the ultimate price in the defense of our nation. Through their courage, everything we enjoy today is made possible. This Memorial Day, keep in mind those who left to serve and never came home. In the News VA Recruitment Seriously Fractured  Supporting Our Coast Guard  With more miles of Great Lakes shoreline than any district in the country, Northern Michigan families and businesses depend on the brave men and women of the Coast Guard to keep our lakes safe and open to commerce. This week we funded the Coast Guard at the level of $8.7 Billion. This bill will include special provisions for Northern Michigan, including funds for a new icebreaker and a policy for creating marine sanctuaries that mirrors the process we used in Thunder Bay! Expanding Access to Federal Lands  Hunting and fishing is a way of life for many in Northern Michigan. We need to ensure that our federal lands are open to these activities. This week, the Committee on Natural Resources held a hearing on my legislation to preserve access to sporting activities in federal forests and lands. I look forward to seeing this bill move through the legislative process. Holding the VA Accountable  Time and time again, we have seen reports from the Inspector General at the VA about wrongdoing and mismanagement. This week, I introduced the Demanding Accountability for Veterans Act, a bill that would require the Inspector General to identify an individual at the VA responsible for fixing the issues they uncover. If that employee does not take steps to fix the issue, they will be formally disciplined, and ultimately dismissed if the problem remains unaddressed. This bill is how we ensure that the VA remains accountable to the veterans they serve. Honoring the Fallen  ?

[D-IL]","Fellow Illinoisans: Since 9/11 more than 6,800 American service members  including 250 sons and daughters of Illinois  have paid the ultimate sacrifice serving our country in the wars in Iraq and Afghanistan. And even as Americas military involvement in those conflicts winds down, American service members continue to risk  and give  their lives to help others around the globe. Earlier this month, Marine Corporal Sara Medina died, along with five fellow Marines, while providing humanitarian relief to the people of Nepal after their terrible earthquake. Corporal Medina was from Aurora, Illinois. She was 23 years old. She was looking forward to coming home this summer to marry a fellow Marine. Memorial Day is about remembering and honoring the sacrifices of all our fallen heroes. We can fulfill that obligation by making sure that our troops today have the best training, the best equipment, and the best protection this nation can provide  and by honoring our sacred pledge to take care of the servicemen and women who do come home. So as we celebrate warmer weather and spend time with family and friends this weekend, let us all remember what this day is really about: honoring the lives of those we have lost. To those who have made that sacrifice, and to their loved ones: thank you. Happy Memorial Day.

Memorial Day is also an important time for reflection for lawmakers in Washington. I am proud of the work we've done in the House to help our Veterans so far this Congress. Legislation like the Hire More Heroes Act and the Ensuring VA Employee Accountability Act are a couple of examples of efforts we are making to ensure our Veterans have access to employment opportunities and quality health care. I will continue to work in Congress to ensure that the heroes who are still with us are treated with the dignity they deserve.  The freedom that we enjoy every day in our great country would not be possible were it not for the service and dedication of the brave men and women in uniform - and the countless who have given their lives to protect it.  Attending one of the many Memorial Day services held across South Louisiana is one way we can honor our fallen and be reminded of the sacrifices they made for us.

[D-CA12]","Slashing Science An Attack on Science House Republicans are threatening to devastate our nations commitment to science and innovation with their ill-conceived COMPETES Act, which is an assault on science and a plan to surrender American leadership. Instead of investing in research and development, this bill slashes funding for essential initiatives in the National Science Foundation, the National Institute of Standards and Technology, and Department of Energy research. It attempts to silence the climate, environmental and social science that conservatives in Congress dont want to hear. I was proud to join 205 of my House colleagues  including every voting Democrat  in opposing this destructive bill. Ban Conversion Therapy Being LGBT is not an illness. It does not require a cure. So-called conversion therapy is not medicine, it is not right, and it has no place in America. We cannot and will not allow conversion therapy peddlers to continue to profit from the abuse of LGBT children and adults. That is why I am proud to support Congressman Ted Lieus Therapeutic Fraud Prevention Act to end this hurtful and hateful practice, which was introduced in the House of Representatives this week. Thanks to his leadership in the state legislature, California became the first state in the nation to ban for-profit conversion therapy. Now we must ensure this abuse has no safe haven anywhere. Ending conversion therapy is a vital step to ensuring that all families have the safety and security needed to keep improving and strengthening our country. As we answer President Obamas call to end conversion therapy, we must all do our part to create a stronger, more just, and welcoming environment for all our families. Casework Success Story I was contacted this week by a constituent whose mother was admitted to the hospital for life-threatening injuries. Her brother and sister, who live in Hong Kong, applied for visitor visas so that they would be able to come to the United States to be with their mother and sister during this difficult time. However, upon applying, they learned that the soonest available appointment was in 30 days. Therefore, my staff sent a request to the U.S. Consulate asking the Consulate to consider expediting an appointment based on the medical emergency. The Consulate agreed and immediately reached out to the family members to schedule an interview that day. Shortly thereafter, I was pleased to learn that my constituents family members were approved for visitor visas.

Its happening in states and in our own communities across the country, right under our noses. In the Senate, I worked to advance legislation that would establish strong anti-trafficking measures that target these predators who traffic innocent young people. As Chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, I shepherded the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act through the committee where it passed unanimously. After a Democratic filibuster, the Senate passed the bill on April 22. It was then passed by the House on Tuesday. On Thursday, I had the opportunity to attend an enrolling ceremony at which the Speaker of the House officially signed this important anti-trafficking bill before sending it to the President. The legislation equips law enforecement with new tools to combat trafficking, enhances services for victims, and increases penalties for perpetrators. In addition, the bill would fight demand for domestic sex trafficking by ensuring that any person who is trafficking an adult or purchasing a child for sex will be punished under the full force of the law. It also contains provisions that I introduced to clarify that federal grant resources can be used to meet the housing needs of trafficking victims, offer training on the effects of sex trafficking to those who serve runaway, homeless and at-risk youth, and create a federal task force to identify best practices to prevent human trafficking. Nobody should have to endure being sold into prostitution or made to work in unlivable conditions. Our bill helps survivors of trafficking heal, and protects others from becoming victims of such a terrible crime. I look forward to seeing the President sign it into law.

H.R. 2250 provides $3.3 billion in discretionary budget authority for operations of the Legislative Branch (excluding Senate operations), including funding of member representational allowances (MRAs), House committees, Capitol Police, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the Architect of the Capitol (AOC), the Capitol Visitor Center (CVC), Library of Congress (LOC), Government Publishing Office (GPO), and the Government Accountability Office (GAO). The bill provides the same amount of funding as the Fiscal Year 2015 enacted level and $172.3 million below the President's request. Funding for the House of Representatives has been reduced by 14 percent since the Republicans gained the House majority in 2011.  [image = Center of NWA.JPG] In addition to H.R. 2250, the House also passed the Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2015 (*H.R. 2353* [link 5])on Tuesday by a vote of 387-35 (*Roll Call #249* [link 6]).H.R. 2353 extends the programmatic and expenditure authority of the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) through July 31, 2015. Safe and reliable transportation infrastructure is essential for sustained economic growth in Arkansas, and I will continue to advocate for a long-term solution for our highways. Piecemeal funding is inadequate and unacceptable, but we mustnt allow our roads and bridges to crumble while we work towards returning solvency and dependability to the Highway Trust Fund once and for all. As such, I supported extending Highway Trust Fund authority through the end of July, preventing a critical interruption in transportation investment as we work to finalize a larger agreement. The HTF currently has sufficient resources to fund its obligations through this period. On Wednesday, the House passed the America COMPETES Act (*H.R. 1806 [link 7]*) by a vote of 217-205 (*Roll Call #258 [link 8]*).H.R. 1806 authorizes funding for specified research and education programs and grants totaling approximately $33 billion over the fiscal year 2016 to 2020 period. It reauthorizes civilian research programs in the National Science Foundation (NSF), the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST), the Department of Energy (DOE), and the Office of Science and Technology Policy (OSTP). This bill prioritizes basic research with targeted investments while staying within the caps enacted intolaw by the Budget Control Act. The bill also establishes a ""national interest"" standard for federal research grants at the NSF and expands the definition of STEM education to include computer science.  [image = The House also passed the American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015 (*H.R. 880 [link 9]*) on Wednesday by a vote of 274-145(*Roll Call #260 [link 10]*). H.R. 4438 establishes a permanent simplified formula for calculating the research tax credit.Moreover, this legislation continues the rule that allows taxpayers to claim a reduced research credit if the taxpayer has no qualified research expenses over the three preceding tax years and increases this credit from six percent to ten percent.Additionally, the bill allows qualified small businesses with $50 million or less in gross receipts to claim these tax credits against Alternative Minimum Tax (AMT) liability. H.R. 880 would be effective for qualifying amounts paid and incurred after December 31, 2014. [image = March of Dimes.JPG] Finally, on Thursday, the House passed the SPACE Act of 2015 (*H.R. 2262 [link 11]*) by a vote of 284-133 (*Roll Call #262 [link 12]*). H.R. 2262 facilitates a pro-growth environment for the developing commercial space industry by encouraging private sector investment, creating more stable and predictable regulatory conditions, and improving safety. Specifically, the bill reaffirms the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) ability to regulate to protect the uninvolved public in the event of an accident or unplanned event, establishes a process for developing a safety framework outside of the regulatory process that can more rapidly address safety concerns without implementing arbitrary regulation and red tape,provides a long-term extension of the third party liability risk-sharing regime to keep American space companies internationally competitive, closes loopholes that leave spaceflight participants vulnerable to financial ruin for participating in commercial human spaceflight, provides flexibility in the experimental permitting and licensing regimes to allow for rapid improvements in safety and reliability systems, andaffirms Congresss commitment to the development of the commercial space industry.

Small towns across the country have buildings that are a danger to our neighbors and a hazard to our environment. Recently, the town of Malone, brought this important issue to my attention as they face crumbling infrastructure and a specific building that may soon collapse into a local stream. Local governments know what is best for their communities and this legislation would ensure that local governments are able to take the appropriate action when the EPA will not. This was a priority of my predecessor, Congressman Bill Owens, and I am proud to introduce this legislation in the 114th Congress. Read more here  .

The goal is to encourage the creativity needed to drive our economy forward. By incorporating the artists perspective into the important work being done in the STEM fields, we can challenge our students to think outside the box and create new solutions to complex problems.

,114,Male,N00033839,43653,"Veasey, Marc (Rep.) [D-TX33]","Dear Friends, It is no secret that increasing daily physical activity and incorporating more nutritious foods into our lives can lead to better health, yet our schedules are filled with a range of responsibilities can sometimes make us put our health on the backburner. Its time to stop all the excuses we have all told ourselves at one time or another and act for our health now. According to the Center for Disease Control, there has been a steady increase in obesity in the United States during the past 20 years. More than one-third of U.S. adults and approximately 12.7 million children and adolescents aged 219 years are obese. Texas ranks at the 15th most obese state with over 30 percent of our state population classified as overweight or obese. That is why during the month of May, I challenged our countrys health and fitness goals by inviting health care providers, nutrition and fitness industry experts, policy makers, the media and individuals to learn more about and encourage healthy, active lifestyle choices. This month, I worked to emphasize the wide reaching health benefits of learning about nutrition and physical activity by introducing a resolution to recognize May as Health and Fitness Month, and organizing events in the DFW Metroplex and Washington D.C. to emphasize education and awareness. To conclude May is Health and Fitness Month, please join me for a free lunch and healthy cooking demonstration with Chef Brenda Johnson on Saturday, May 30 at 11 a.m. at Nash-Davis Recreation Center. Space is limited, so please RSVP. As always, I invite you to connect with me through my official website, Facebook page, and Twitter account to stay informed of what I am working on in the District and in D.C. Sincerely, Congressman Marc Veasey, TX-33  Rep. Veasey Celebrates Success of Health & Fitness events in DFW and Washington D.C. On Friday May 1, 2015, I renewed my yearly pledge to health and fitness by introducing House Resolution 249 for the third year in a row. House Resolution 249 would designate the month of May as Health and Fitness Month. My resolution aims to ensure that our country pledges to make health and fitness a priority every day, so that all Americans can live to their maximum potential. As the resolution circulated for support, I organized a variety of health and fitness events throughout the 33rd Congressional District and Washington D.C. to help educate Americans of all backgrounds on the healthier choices they can make every day. CD33 Residents Join Congressman Veaseys Yearly Pledge to Health and Fitness On Saturday, May 16, 2015, I hosted a free community fitness day at Tarrant County College that provided residents in the 33rd Congressional District the opportunity for interactive health demonstrations with a range of organizations dedicated to making health and fitness a priority in North Texas.

I was proud to introduce an amendment directing the Department of Defense to evaluate how DACA and other deferred action programs would affect military recruiting efforts because I believe these executive actions on immigration will be shown to greatly improve our military readiness. Congressman Gallego also introduced an amendment that encourages the Secretary of Defense to consider allowing DREAMers into the military, which I was proud to support.

Congressmans Veaseys Tips for Everyday Health & Fitness The road to living a healthy lifestyle can sometimes seem like a long journey with many obstacles in our daily lives keeping us from investing in our health. For this reason, it can be easier to make smaller changes every day. Below, I want to share some of my favorite tips to make health a priority every day. How to eat healthier when enjoying a meal out with friends and family  Hack the menu in half: Even on the hungriest day, the average restaurant portion can be twice the recommended calories for one meal. When eating out, eat half your meal at the restaurant and take the other half to-go for later in the day. This simple step will cut the calories you consume in half while allowing you to enjoy a meal out with friends and loved ones.  Appetizers are the new entre: Given the portion inflation that often occurs at restaurants, one of the easiest ways to enjoy a meal without going over your recommended calorie intake is to order an appetizer. Appetizers tend to be smaller portions, but with the full flavor of a main entre.  Watch out for liquid calorie overload: Those delicious shakes we love to enjoy at our favorite burger spot or Frappuccino from a local coffee shop are often 400 calories or more. Although delicious, opting for a glass of water is a way to save calories for the main course. The In-Between Votes Workout Between constituent meetings, committee mark-ups, floor votes and my other daily responsibilities, I can find it hard to get in my daily exercise. For this reason, I do all I can to sneak in physical activity. . Check out my 15 minute workout and exercises that you can do at work or home below. These short exercises can be fit in at nearly any point in our day to keep our hearts healthy and our bodies moving.

Later in the week the Congressman also sat down with Greta Brawner of C-SPANs Washington Journal  to discuss veterans mental health issues, including veterans access to medication for their anxiety and posttraumatic stress. A person who is in the midst of posttraumatic stress disorder has three choices: first, you can be a victim; you can think about the sad and terrible experiences and live under this giant boulder. The second choice is to be a survivor, say despite what happened Im moving on with my life. The third choice is to be a thriver; that because of what happened to me I will be stronger, faster, better, smarter.

,114,Male,N00024753,43472,"Coffman, Mike (Rep.) [R-CO6]","Congressman Mike Coffman - Serving the 6th District of Colorado ========================================================= [image =  Dear Friends: On Wednesday there was a looming shutdown at the Aurora VA hospital, with House Speaker John Boehner fed up with the VAs mismanagement and threatening to cut off any further authorized spending to continue construction on the hospital. While I shared the Speakers great frustration and anger at the VAs gross mismanagement and bureaucratic incompetence, as a Marine Corps combat veteran, I also appreciate how vital it is that this hospital is built so that we can fulfill our obligation to the men and women who served this nation. Veterans are counting on this hospital being built so that they can receive the state-of-the art healthcare it will provide. Recently, some of my colleagues in Congress began to question the importance of this project referring it as a Colorado problem. The veterans that this hospital is designed to care for served this nation and this nation owes them a debt of gratitude for their sacrifices in defense of our freedom. Shocked and disappointed at this turn of events, I fought hard to convince House leadership of the need to give us a short-term extension to develop a solution to the nearly $1 billion in cost overruns. I emphasized how a shutdown could cost taxpayers even more money, with the general contractor estimating up to $200 million in additional costs should the project shut down or mothballed, and constructed at a later date. The solution to this hospital must come with protections for taxpayers, no negative impact on veterans care across the country, and reforms that ensure such a situation never occurs again. We have won this battle, but the fight to complete the hospital is far from over. The bill we passed raises the spending cap and authorizes VA and Kiewit-Turner to spend an additional $20 million on this project, effectively funding it for around three more weeks, at which point Congress must pass another agreement to continue construction. I will continue to keep the pressure up on Congressional and VA leadership, and will not stop until we have a plan in place that will see this project completed and ensure such a failure never happens again. I owe that commitment to my fellow veterans on this upcoming Memorial Day while we remember those who gave the ultimate sacrifice for our freedom.

But the really heavy lifting will be done 1,500 miles away in Washington. The U.S. House agreed Thursday to raise the projects spending cap by $100 million, enough to continue work for three weeks. The Senate is expected to act Friday. Congress and the Veterans Affairs Department still must find up to $830 million to finish the vastly over-budget hospital without taking services away from veterans elsewhere and possibly scale back the project. The VA also must persuade skeptical lawmakers that its serious about punishing those responsible for the problems and making internal changes to avoid a repeat. Theyve been offering us crumbs of reform, said Tyler Sandberg, a spokesman for Colorado Republican *Rep. Mike Coffman*. We want the whole loaf. The hospital in suburban Aurora is expected to cost $1.73 billion, nearly three times the estimate the VA gave last year. The VA said Monday that it was nearing the $800 million spending cap Congress put on the project and work would have to stop next week if Congress didnt act. Contractor Kiewit-Turner said winding down the work and then cranking it up again would add up to $200 million to the cost. The deal reached Thursday doesnt give the VA any additional money but allows it to spend funds it has on hand. It raises the spending cap to $900 million, enough for three weeks of work. That means the VA and Congress have three weeks to work out a long-term deal or again face a shutdown. Im pleased the House finally acted to avoid a shutdown on this project, said Rep. Ed Perlmutter, D-Colo. But Im not pleased we will continue to kick the can down the road. The ambitious, 184-bed medical center is a collection of a dozen large interconnected buildings that would replace an old, overcrowded facility operating in Denver. The reasons the costs escalated so sharply have yet to be fully explained. The VA has said the plans werent complete when work began, and VA construction executives tried to switch to a different design-and-build process too late. At least two internal VA investigations are underway, and the department says all the key executives on the project have been replaced  some were demoted or transferred, and another retired a day after investigators interviewed him under oath. But no one has been fired, angering many in Congress. The VA wanted to finish the project with money siphoned from a $5 billion fund Congress set up to resolve an embarrassing national scandal  long wait times for veterans to get health care. Lawmakers balked, saying the VA needed to come up with a different funding plan that didnt deny services to other veterans or raise the federal deficit. Veterans elsewhere cannot be forced to sacrifice just because of the catastrophe here, Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said during a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee hearing in Aurora last month. *Coffman* suggested diverting the VAs multimillion-dollar bonus budget to the Denver hospital. VA Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson called that a lousy idea. Congress also wants the VA to make major internal changes to avoid a repeat  perhaps turning over responsibility for major construction projects to the Army Corps of Engineers. Veterans expressed relief that a deal was reached. The veterans are the ones that would be hurt if the project got shut down, said Steven Rylant, president of the United Veterans Committee of Colorado, a coalition of veterans groups. The committee is not taking a position on where the money should come from, said Rylant, who often sports a button that says BTDT, which stands for Build the damn thing. Seems like there ought to be $1 billion or $600 million somewhere, he said. *One-on-One Constituent Meetings* *Saturday, May 30, 2015* *2:00 PM  3:30 PM* *Tallyn's Reach Library* *23911 E Arapahoe Rd* *Aurora, CO 80016*  *Coffman Bill Would Continue Veterans' Affairs Hospital Construction for 3 Mo* *By: Joe Cogliano* *ABC Denver* [link 7] *Published May 21st, 2015* While Aurora *Congressman Mike Coffman* races to find stopgap money, the vast, half-finished veterans hospital in Aurora remains mired in an embarrassing scandal with $1 billion in cost overruns making it almost impossible for the VA to persuade skeptical lawmakers to keep the money flowing. The Veterans Affairs Department said it will run out of cash and construction will stop next week unless Congress raises the projects $800-million spending cap by Sunday. The contractor says a shutdown would delay the project by months and raise the cost beyond the current estimate, $1.73 billion. As of Thursday morning, *Coffman*, R-Aurora, said an agreement has been reached with Boehner on a $100-million, three-week extension that will give more time to negotiate a longer-term agreement. The pact passed a House floor vote and now goes to the Senate. *Coffmans* bill, HR 2496, the Construction Authorization and Choice Improvement Act, will help keep the Aurora VA hospital from shutting down this weekend by raising the authorization cap to $900 million and reforming elements of the Choice Act that will help veterans receive care outside of the VA system, according to a statement by *Coffman*. Work was set to stop this Sunday if Congress did not raise the authorization cap for the project. The current authorization cap is set at $800 million. The VA asked Congress to approve additional spending and keep construction going with money already in hand while sorting out a longer-term plan. It also offered to cut the cost by about $55 million by indefinitely delaying construction of a nursing home and a post-traumatic stress disorder clinic on the hospital campus. Boehner wants more cuts and a plan to pay for the entire project, not just to keep construction moving for a few months, *Coffman* said. *Coffman* took an unusual swipe at a leader of his own party Wednesday, saying he was disappointed Boehner wouldnt approve a short-term deal to avoid a shutdown. In a statement to The Associated Press, Boehner said the issue is bigger than the Denver hospital. It is about the continuing culture of irresponsibility at the Veterans Administration, he said. The VA needs to produce a plan to complete this project on-time and on-budget. The chances of reaching a deal to avoid a shutdown were uncertain at best, and Congress is scheduled to begin a weeklong Memorial Day recess this weekend. VA Secretary Robert McDonald said Wednesday he had made numerous reasonable proposals to Congress and all were rejected. Republican Rep. Jeff Miller of Florida, chairman of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, told McDonald: VA created the mess in Denver, so the department must come up with a plan to fix it that does not add to the deficit and does not jeopardize the benefits and services of other veterans. Veterans are worried and feel caught in the middle. It would be devastating for the veterans of Colorado for Congress not to pass this and let it get shut down, said Steven Rylant, president of the United Veterans Committee of Colorado, a coalition of veterans groups. This a regional medical center were talking about, Rylant said. It doesnt just affect Colorado, but states around the region, so its incredibly important to get it finished. As recently as last year, the VA said the hospital would cost about $600 million, and the reasons it spun out of control have yet to be fully explained. The VA has said the plans werent complete when work began, and VA construction executives tried to switch to a different type of design-and-build process too late. At least two internal VA investigations are underway, and the department says all the key executives on the project have been replaced  some were demoted or transferred, and another retired one day after investigators interviewed him under oath. But no one has been fired, angering many in Congress. The ambitious, 184-bed medical center in suburban Aurora is a collection of a dozen large interconnected buildings that would replace an old and overcrowded facility operating in Denver. But the VA and contractor Kiewit-Turner couldnt agree on costs and plans, and a panel of judges ruled in December that the VA had breached the contract because the hospital couldnt be built for the agreed-upon price of about $600 million. Construction stopped, and recriminations started. Senators and representatives accused the VA of arrogance, deceit and incompetence. Colorado lawmakers said they had been trying to get answers from the VA for months, even before the December ruling. Construction resumed at a scaled-back pace under an interim contract while a new contract is negotiated with Kiewit-Turner, but if the money runs out, it will stop again. The VA says it needs another $830 million to finish the hospital as currently designed, or about $775 million without the nursing home and PTSD clinic. The VA wants to tap a $5 billion fund Congress approved to resolve another scandal, long wait times for veterans seeking health care, but that has encountered strong opposition. Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., said during a Senate Veterans Affairs Committee hearing in Aurora last month that veterans elsewhere cannot be forced to sacrifice just because of the catastrophe here. ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- [link 1] [link 2] [link 3] [link 4] [link 5] [link 6] [link 7] ========================================================= OFFICES Washington Office ------------------ 2443 Rayburn HOB Washington, D.C. 20515 Phone: (202) 225-7882 Fax: (202) 226-4623 District Office ---------------- Cherry Creek Place IV 3300 S.

May 22, 2015 IN THIS ISSUE:  Senator Collins Named ""Most Bipartisan"" in New Index  Senator Collins Advocates for Reauthorization of TAA from the Senate Floor  Senator Collins Chairs Hearing on Medicare Problem That Can Cost Seniors  Senator Collins Named One of the 25 Most Influential Women in Congress  Senator Collins Meets with Thornton Academy E Award Recipient  Meeting With Mainers WEEKLY COLUMN ""Honoring Our Heroes"" By: Senator Susan M. Collins More than a century and a half ago, as our nation faced its gravest crisis during the Civil War, President Abraham Lincoln spoke of the ""mystic cords of memory, stretching from every patriot grave to every living heart and hearthstone all over this broad land.'' >From the founding of our great nation to the conflicts of today, the men and women of our armed forces strengthen those mystic cords. From generation to generation, they add new and everlasting strands of valor, devotion to duty, and sacrifice. This Memorial Day, throughout Maine and across America, we gather again to express our gratitude. In countless villages, small towns, and big cities, we raise our voices in song and bow our heads in prayer in honor of those who gave their all for each of us. As we do these things, we are again reminded that freedom is a gift purchased at the greatest possible price. As we come together in our shared gratitude, as we look down the rows of headstones, the flowers, and the flags, we see our history. It is a history written not by conquerors, but by ordinary men and women who answered the extraordinary call to defend liberty. Many brave American men and women have given their lives overseas fighting for the freedom of others. As retired General and former Secretary of State Colin Powell said, ""We have asked for nothing in return except the ground to bury them in."" As the recent loss of six Marines performing rescue operations following the earthquake in Nepal reminds us, our servicemembers also are courageous and committed humanitarians. The very origins of Memorial Day speak to these values. It is significant that a day dedicated to the deepest of human emotions - grief, remembrance and gratitude - began not by decree from any high authority, but with the spontaneous, heartfelt actions of ordinary people. As the Civil War ravaged the countryside and took an ever greater and more ghastly human toll, Confederate widows and grieving mothers began placing wildflowers on the graves of their loved ones, and on the graves of Union soldiers -- the loved ones of widows and mothers they did not know but with whom they shared a sacred bond. Union widows and grieving mothers soon adopted that custom. Those origins, those mystic cords, connect to our time. Were we to gather at any veterans' cemetery throughout America or abroad, in December, we would look down the rows of headstones decorated with rings of balsam and ribbons of red. The Wreaths Across America project is Maine's unique way of expressing the gratitude that is felt worldwide. As we honor the fallen, we also honor those who served and returned home, and those who serve today. One of my greatest privileges as a Senator has been the opportunities I've had to visit our troops overseas, in Korea, in Kosovo, and three times in Iraq and Afghanistan. In them, I see the same courage and compassion that have been the true insignia of America's armed forces throughout our history. To read the rest of Senator Collins' Weekly Column click here  . Senator Collins Named ""Most Bipartisan"" in New Index  To watch the segment from WABI click here  or the play button above. >From the Associated Press  ""Collins At Head of Class on Bipartisan Index"" ""Republican Sen. Susan Collins of Maine likes to tout her efforts to reach across the aisle. ""The Lugar Center and the McCourt School of Public Policy at Georgetown University says it's not all talk. She won the top ranking in the annual 'Bipartisan Index.' ""The index focuses on how often a senator works with the other party to serve as sponsor or co-sponsor of a bill. ""Former Sen. Richard Lugar of the Lugar Center served with Collins in the Senate. He said he's seen firsthand 'her dedication to good policy and her openness to working productively with members representing a wide range of viewpoints.' l Journal Panel titled 'Beyond Partisanship: Breaking Washington's Political Gridlock.'"" The story was also featured in USA Today  , The New York Times  , and The Courier Gazette  .  Senator Collins Advocates for Reauthorization of TAA from the Senate Floor As the Senate considered Trade Promotion Authority legislation this week, Senator Collins spoke from the Senate floor advocating for the reauthorization of Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA), which expired at the end of 2014. In her statement, Senator Collins referenced a recent visit to Eastern Maine Community College in Bangor where she spoke with a group of students who are former employees of the Verso mill in Bucksport, which closed unexpectedly last year. Because of Trade Adjustment Assistance, these former workers are now enrolled in a fine furniture making program and are learning new skills for in-demand jobs. ""I was so impressed with their determination and their attitude,"" said Senator Collins from the Senate floor. ""Their determination to start new careers after years of working at the mills at Bucksport was inspiring and each of them was enrolled thanks to the support provided by the Trade Adjustment Assistance program. Without that program, they would not have had the funding, the support, and the resources, necessary to enable them to do a midlife career change.""  To watch the video click here  or the play button above. Senator Collins also outlined the success of TAA programs in Maine noting that in the 2013 fiscal year alone, more than 700 Mainers have used TAA programs and more than 70% of those participants have found employment within 3 months of completing their retraining programs.  Senator Collins Chairs Hearing on Medicare Problem That Can Cost Seniors Senate Aging Committee Chairman Susan Collins and Ranking Member Claire McCaskill led a bipartisan panel examining the dramatic growth in the use of ""observation status"" by hospitals and the effects it has on patients and the health care industry. The hearing, ""Challenging the Status Quo: Solutions to the Hospital Observation Stay Crisis,"" included input from key stakeholders and examined various proposals that are designed to solve the problem of over-reliance on the use of observation status by hospitals.  To watch the video click here  or the play button above. Tori Gaetani of Beacon Health, a member of the national pilot program to enable Medicare patients to be treated at a skilled nursing facility under Medicare without the hospital inpatient stay requirement, was invited to testify by Senator Collins. Ms. Gaetani spoke about how the program has improved care of seniors and reduced overall costs of care.  >From the Bangor Daily News  ""Are you being 'observed' in the hospital? Seniors, you might get a hefty bill"" ""If you're a Medicare enrollee who has been hit by an unexpected medical bill, you might be familiar with the term 'observation status.' ""Hospitals increasingly are placing seniors under 'observation' instead of admitting them as inpatients, and a Senate panel led by U.S. Sen. Susan Collins wants them to hit the brakes. ""Many seniors are surprised to learn they were never admitted, even after staying overnight at a hospital and receiving treatment, testing and medications. Most learn about it when a bill arrives in the mail for out-of-pocket costs they never anticipated. ""Why are hospitals doing this, why is it costing seniors money and how is Maine responding? Here's a breakdown: ""Observation status is for patients not healthy enough to go home but not sick enough to be admitted. Doctors use observation time to decide whether to admit a patient, such as by running tests or performing lab work. As Kaiser Health News explains, 'this care requires a doctor's order and is considered an outpatient service, even though patients may stay as long as several days.' Under Medicare guidelines, hospitals should decide whether to admit patients within 24 to 48 hours."" To read the full article click here  .  Senator Collins Named One of the 25 Most Influential Women in Congress U.S. Senator Susan Collins was named one of the ""25 Most Influential Women in Congress"" CQ Weekly's Power Issue. Senator Collins was also recognized as one of the top 5 women who shape the debate in Congress. This article will be expanded upon in an electronic book  also authored by CQ Roll Call entitled, ""Powerful Women: The Most Influential Women in Congress."" Senator Collins spoke at a reception this week which was held to launch the electronic book.   >From the Bangor Daily News - State and Capitol  ""Susan Collins named one of the most powerful women in Washington"" ""Maine has a long history of sending especially influential people to Washington to represent it, ranging from Ed Muskie to Margaret Chase Smith to George Mitchell to Olympia Snowe. Republican Sen. Susan Collins is no exception and anyone who is paying attention knows she has built a reputation as a power broker who holds considerable sway on Capitol Hill. ""On Monday, a well-known publication called CQ Roll Call in its annual 'Power Issue' named Collins one of the 25 most influential women in Congress and one of the top five women who shape the congressional debate. ""'Her moderate status helps her shape legislation in a divided government,' reads the article. 'If a provision can't win her support, it likely won't become law.' ""Collins was quoted as saying that while women bring a range of ideologies to government, one truth that binds them is that 'women of the Senate are more likely to collaborate and to realize that we can disagree on an issue but still seek common ground.'""  Appropriations Committee Approves Funding for Renovations at Bangor Air National Guard Wing Senator Susan Collins, a senior member of the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Subcommittee, announced this week that the Senate Appropriations Committee has approved $7.2 million to complete renovations of the Bangor Air National Guard Wing's fire and rescue facility. Senator Collins raised the importance of this funding during a March 2015 subcommittee hearing with the Air Force, and advocated for it with her Appropriations colleagues. ""I'm pleased that this bill would fund the urgently needed fire and crash rescue improvements at the 101st Air Refueling Wing in Bangor, supporting those who put their lives on the line to protect our nation,"" said Senator Collins. ""This funding would facilitate the Wing's critical missions, such as providing air refueling support to United States Strategic Command as well as logistical and support services to the airport, Bangor community, and State of Maine."" The funding was approved during the Committee's consideration of the 2016 Fiscal Year Military Construction and Veterans Affairs spending bill that provides resources for veterans' benefits and programs and makes funding available for military construction projects. Senator Collins voted in favor of the bill, which was approved by a vote of 21 to 9 and now awaits final consideration by the full Senate. To read the full press release click here  .  Senator Collins Meets with Thornton Academy E Award Recipient Senator Susan Collins was joined by Thornton Academy Headmaster, Rene Menard and Director of Admissions, Mark Powers in Washington this week to celebrate the Thornton Academy's recent recognition from the Department of Commerce for its long-standing efforts to promote international education and economic and cultural development by drawing students from around the world.  Prior to the meeting, Secretary of Commerce Penny Pritzker presented the Department of Commerce's E Award to Thornton Headmaster Rene Menard. The E Award is the highest recognition any U.S. entity can receive for making a significant contribution to the expansion of U.S. exports. Established by executive order by President Kennedy, the E Award is a symbol of excellence to honor and provide recognition to America's exporters. Thornton Academy, a leader in international education, is the first Maine organization and non-college to win an E Award since 1983.  Honoring a Maine Legend  Senator Susan Collins introduced former Maine Senator George Mitchell at a reception launching his memoir, ""The Negotiator: Reflections on an American Life.""  Meeting with Mainers Senator Collins always makes time to meet individually with constituents- either Mainers who are visiting Washington, D.C. or at home in Maine.

[R-AK0]","Dear Friends, As the 114th Congress moves forward, I remain committed to keeping you informed about and involved in the many decisions being made in Washington, D.C. Im proud to provide you with a brief update on the many steps being made in the U.S. House of Representatives to advance solution-based policies that build a stronger and safer America. The House remains committed and focused on moving a legislative agenda based on empowering individuals with opportunity, restoring freedom, standing up to job killing rules and regulations, and holding this Administration accountable. For too long, the federal government has focused its efforts on moving top-down policies and regulations that ignore the needs of American families and small businesses. This we know best decision making  to the detriment of the nation and the economy  has gone on for too long. Congressman Young discussing timber harvests in the House Natural Resources Committee. Congressman Young Shares Memorial Day Message with Alaskans Congressman Don Young shares a Memorial Day message with Alaskans (click here to view). Happy Memorial Day, Alaska! Memorial Day is more than picnics, fishing, and time out on the water with friends and family, its a time to remember our fallen heroes and those that have proudly served in the military. As you celebrate Memorial Day, its important to remember the many sacrifices of our brave men and women in uniform  those that fell during conflict and those that were wounded. We owe them a great big thank you! I hope you and your families have a safe and wonderful time in each others company, but please remember this celebration is about those that served in the military, those that sacrificed  the ultimate sacrifice, those that fought to protect our freedoms. God bless you and God bless our military men and women who have served this great nation in the past, in the present, and in the future. Clear Air Force Station Selected as Location for Long Range Discrimination Radar Clear Air Force Station located in Anderson, Alaska The Missile Defense Agency has announced it will position its Long Range Discrimination Radar at Clear Air Force Radar Station, in Anderson, Alaska. This is a big win for Alaska and the nation. This decision underscores Alaskas unparalleled strategic location and helps solidify our role in strengthening Americas missile defense shield. With growing threats from both North Korea and Iran, its critical that this radar system be positioned in an area that covers both these nations; Clear Air Force Station offers that location. I proudly worked with my colleagues in Congress to secure funding and authorization for this essential project, and look forward to seeing its completion in the coming years. Click here to read more. Coast Guard Authorization Passes House with Alaska Provisions The House recently passed bipartisan legislation to advance a number of reforms and priorities to support the Coast Guards critical mission of protecting our oceans and waterways. In addition to giving the Coast Guard the resources, tools and reforms needed to fulfill their priorities, I was proud to see the inclusion of a number of provisions to reduce burdensome regulations placed upon our mariners and fishermen, and efforts to support the disposal of shuttered federal properties in Tok, AK.

East Anchorage High School Student Wins Congressional Art Competition for Alaska Congressional Art Competition winner, Celebrating the Generations, drawn by East Anchorage High School student (click here for more information) Each year, I have the unique opportunity to sponsor a piece of artwork from an Alaskan high school student to be displayed in the halls of Congress as part of the Congressional Art Competition. Because we have so many talented young Alaskan artists, I have partnered with the Alaska Association of School Activities (AASA) to select our winner from the many beautiful pieces competing in the All-State Art Competition. I recently announced the 2015 Congressional Art Competition winner for Alaska, East Anchorage High School student Laura Horton who was recognized for her piece titled Celebrating the Generations. She writes, ""This drawing represents generations in Alaska. It depicts a tree, my father, and myself. The layout of the drawing lets the viewer see, in a less obvious way, the number 100, because it is the 100th anniversary of the city of Anchorage."" Lauras unique and creative art piece will represent Alaska well in the halls of Congress. Her infusion of Alaskan heritage and history will certainly captivate audiences, which will include heads of state and government, and countless Americans visiting the U.S. Capitol.

To ensure a proper balance between the biological needs of our fish stocks and the economic needs of our fishermen and coastal communities, I have introduced H.R. 1335, the Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act. This legislation provides a number of modest but necessary reforms to our fisheries management law, including efforts to: provide fisheries managers with increased flexibility and transparency; allow for improved data collection through the use of electronic monitoring; increase accountability for our federal agencies; and create predictability and certainty for coastal communities that depend on stable fishing In many ways, the MSA continues to support Alaska fishermen and protect our fishery resource as envisioned. But as Ive learned in Congress, our laws are not written in stone and we must constantly review them, listen to our constituents and make changes when necessary. While I have missed teaming up with Senator Stevens during this process, as we did for the first time in 1976 and for the last time in 2006, I have remember him fondly as we have worked to update the law bearing his name. For more information on H.R. 1335, which passed the House Natural Resources Committee and is expected on the House floor during the first week of June, please click here. Critical Alaska Provisions Pass in National Defense Authorization The House recently passed the Fiscal Year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act, which makes a number of significant improvements and reforms to the militarys acquisition process, workforce management, troop benefits and retirement. Alaska fared very well through the inclusion of several important provisions, including those that fund the procurement of the F-35, missile defense, and a number of construction projects. I was also pleased to see the inclusion of my amendments, which reaffirm the F-35 basing at Eielson Air Force Base, update the 8(a) Small Business Administration procurement process, and authorize a land transfer to Galena, AK.

Bicameral Legislation to Spur Future Development of Point Spencer Introduced Senator Lisa Murkowski and I have introduced bicameral legislation to streamline development on Point Spencer by transferring 2,500 acres unused federal lands to state and local stakeholders. Theres no question that this region is in desperate need of development, particularly as activity in the region increases and ship traffic through the Bering Strait nearly doubled in recent years. I believe this legislation, which is both equitable and sensible, is the best path forward to ensure the interests of all stakeholders are met when optimizing the use of this critically important land.

ICYMI: KNOM radio featured Congressman Young and Senator Murkowskis legislation in a recent news report (click here to listen) House and Senate Approve Congressional Review of Iran Nuclear Deal The House and Senate overwhelmingly passed legislation to mandate Congressional approval of an Iran nuclear deal currently being negotiated by the Obama Administration. The passage of this important legislation proves that a majority of Americans believe negotiations with Iran must include the voice of Congress. I believe as the body that set these sanctions in place, Congress must play an integral role in removing them. Any deal to lighten sanctions must stop Iran in their tracks and take them out of the drivers seat to developing, building or acquiring a nuclear weapon, which means the inclusion of stringent transparency measures, compliance reviews, and concrete and enforceable measures to dismantle Irans nuclear weapons infrastructure. The broad-based sanctions currently in place have brought Iran to the negotiating table, and now we must hold their feet to the fire and demand a long list of requirements before any relief can be put in place.

House Votes to Halt Administrations Massive Expansion of Waters of the United States Im pleased to report that the House has passed legislation to halt the Obama Administrations massive expansion of federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act (CWA), which would significantly change federal policy relating to U.S. waters - including ponds, ditches, culverts, and other wet areas  and significantly erode the states statutory authority to regulate waters within their own boundaries. This proposed rule making by the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers would have dire consequences in Alaska (which is already classified as 40% wetlands) by requiring endless federal regulations and permitting for even the most reasonable activity.

Watch my speech below honoring our fallen heroes   Visiting veterans at the Tucson VA Health Center On Friday, I had the opportunity to meet with veterans receiving care at the VA Health Center in Tucson and distribute thank you letters written by local elementary school students. It was a privilege to thank these heroes in person for their service and I also thank Councilmembers Richard Fimbres and Shirley Scott and State Representative Chris Ackerley for joining me.  Helping Service Members' Transition to Civilian Life As a veteran, I know the difficulties our returning service members face as they look to transition to civilian life, which is why this week I introduced a bill to make it easier for our veterans to obtain good-paying jobs using the benefits they earned. Currently, the unemployment rate for post-9  . It's an honor to represent your voice, and I wish you and your family a safe and meaningful Memorial Day.

Dr. Rand Paul Successfully Filibusters to Reform Unconstitutional Domestic Spying On Wednesday, I successfully filibustered attempts to move to an extension of the USA PATRIOT Act. During the filibuster, I highlighted the need for an open and robust debate and amendment process in order to achieve comprehensive surveillance reform of domestic spying. My filibuster lasted for ten and half hours. We have to decide as a country whether we value our Bill of Rights, and our privacy or whether we're willing to give those up to feel safer. There comes to a time in the history of nations when fear and complacency allow power to accumulate and liberty and privacy to suffer. That time is now. And I will not let the PATRIOT Act, the most un-patriotic of acts, go unchallenged. You can read the full statement on my filibuster HERE. You can also watch the entire filibuster HERE. Dr. Rand Paul Unveils Latest Edition of 'The Waste Report' On Monday, I unveiled the latest edition of 'The Waste Report.' 'The Waste Report' is an ongoing project to catalog egregious examples of wasteful spending throughout the U.S. government. This week's report uncovers thousands of potentially wasted taxpayer dollars at the U.S. Department of Education. The latest edition of 'The Waste Report' can be found HERE. Dr. Rand Paul & Sen. Mark Warner Introduce the Bonuses for Cost-Cutters Act of 2015 This week, Senator Mark Warner (D-VA) and I introduced the Bonuses for Cost-Cutters Act of 2015. This bipartisan legislation will empower those on the front lines of federal spending to find efficiencies and improve productivity to return value to the taxpayer in the form of deficit reduction and less government borrowing. Under the current law, federal employees have a perverse incentive to spend all of their agencys annual budget before the end of the year, and subsequently, bonuses will reverse the incentive to the benefit of both the employee and the taxpayer. The Bonuses for Cost-Cutters Act will reduce the federal deficit and reverse the trend toward agency bloat, by combating inefficiency and mismanagement of funds in the government. You can read my full statement HERE. Dr. Rand Paul and Sen. Brian Schatz Introduce the Stop Militarizing Our Law Enforcement Act Thursday, Senator Brian Schatz (D-HI) and I introduced the Stop Militarizing Our Law Enforcement Act of 2015. This bipartisan legislation will establish limitations and create greater transparency on the transfer of surplus military-grade equipment to local law enforcement agencies. Not surprisingly, big government in Washington has created an incentivized system in which local law enforcement is provided mass amounts of equipment to build up forces that resemble small armies. By putting these restrictions on the current transfer programs, we can eliminate the wasteful spending these programs have created and stop the militarization of our police forces. Read my entire statement HERE. Dr. Rand Paul Meets with Certified Public Accountants from Kentucky On Tuesday I sat down with a group of Certified Public Accountants (CPA) from Kentucky who were in town for the American Institute of CPA's Spring Council meeting. During our discussion we touched on making tax reform a priority and the effectiveness of the Internal Revenue Service's taxpayer services. (Dr. Rand Paul with Certified Public Accountants from Kentucky - May 19, 2015) Dr. Rand Paul Speaks with Kentuckians from the American Association for Homecare Also this week, I spoke with Thad Connally of Bowling Green, a member of the American Association for Homecare. During our meeting we discussed Medicare issues affecting homecare providers including: audit reform, prior authorization for home medical equipment and separate benefit legislation for complex rehab power wheelchairs. (Dr. Rand Paul with the American Association for Homecare - May 19, 2015) Media Wrap-Up This week, I appeared on NBC's 'Meet the Press,' CNN's and 'The Lead with Jake Tapper' and 'New Day,' and Fox News' 'Hannity' and 'America's Newsroom.' Additionally, I spoke with several radio stations across the country, as well as stations in Kentucky including Brian Thomas of WKRC, Terry Meiners of WHAS, and Bill Cunningham of WLW.

,114,Male,N00032441,43529,"Nugent, Richard (Rep.) [R-FL11]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email  News from Representative Richard Nugent  Dear Friends, With all of the ongoing focus about the NSA reform bill I talked about last week in this newsletter, I wanted to give you all a quick veterans update. This week, the House passed and handful of helpful bills (the Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Programs Reauthorization Act, the Vulnerable Veterans Housing Reform Act, the Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Relief Act, the Ensuring VA Employee Accountability Act and the Veteran's I.D. Card Act). That last bill has been of particular interest to veterans in our community, as it would permit the VA to issue veterans an ID card proving they are veterans. Right now, if you hope to qualify for a veteran discount, a lot of times you have to tote around a DD-214. That's not practical. VA funding has also done well. In the last six years, the VA's budget has increased by about 73 percent. The funding bill we passed a few weeks ago provides $163 billion for the VA's budget next year. To put that in perspective, Florida's entire state budget for roads, education, healthcare, etc for the 2014 fiscal year was about $74 billion. The VA has the resources it needs. What remains is largely a question of leadership and management. Congress allocated billions of extra dollars in the wake of the Phoenix VA scandal that was designated specifically for efforts to reduce the VA's wait times - new infrastructure, more physicians, medical staff and so on. But on VA's end, very little has happened. From that pot of $15 billion, the VA still has roughly $14 billion and change left to allocate. We've brought in the head of a Fortune 500 company to bring some private sector know-how to the agency, but still only one person ended up getting fired for the scandal about secret waitlists and records manipulation at more than a hundred VA facilities. Congress has tried to help things along some more by passing historic reforms that give the Secretary of the VA the ability to fire underperforming executives, but that authority is only worth so much if it isn't used. Fortunately, because Congress controls the money directly, we've been able to put a block on bonuses within the agency. Perhaps most crucially though, most members of Congress invest a lot of personal time and staff resources in trying to help individual veterans with specific VA problems. If we hear that somebody is experiencing excessive wait times, for instance, most of us will crack heads until that situation is resolved. If somebody is getting the run around about a benefits issue, we won't hesitate to step in. And in a system of government where legislative victories are earned slowly over time and agencies are otherwise slow to act, being able to break the logjam for an individual or a family with a problem can often be the most gratifying part of the job. Many of you have probably heard me say this before, but if you know of anybody who is being ignored by a federal agency, I hope you will feel free to give them my contact info. All Americans deserve a government that is as accountable to them as the Founders intended, but this is perhaps most especially true for those Americans who have volunteered to sacrifice themselves in service to the rest of us. It is an honor to be able to go to bat for you. Don't fight the bureaucracy alone. Thanks, as always and please let me know if anything comes up.

junior,"112,113,114",Male,N00001489,400408,"Toomey, Patrick “Pat” (Sen.) [R-PA]"," Standing Up For Police This week, President Obama announced he would seek to restrict local law enforcement from receiving lifesaving, surplus federal equipment, such as riot helmets and riot shields. After the riots in Baltimore, Ferguson, and New York City, where protesters torched police cars and hurled bricks, cement blocks, and glass bottles at law enforcement, why would we make it harder to send riot gear that would otherwise sit unused to unprotected police officers across the country? I cannot stand by and watch the President take away this lifesaving equipment from the brave men and women who dedicate their lives to protecting our communities all across Pennsylvania and America. That is why I sent a letter directly to President Obama clearly laying out my concerns with his decision. We should be helping our police officers who are running towards chaos, destruction, and violence - as we recently saw during the motorcycle gang shooting Waco, Texas. We should not be making their jobs more dangerous. You can read my entire letter to President Obama here. You can also watch my video from last week as our nation celebrated National Police Week. Supporting Cancer Research Last year, my mother-in-law was diagnosed with multiple myeloma - a form of blood cancer. In response, my wife, Kris, has embarked on an extraordinary journey. While reading a magazine at her mother's bedside in the hospital, she discovered a team was being put together by the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation for the Ironman Lake Placid this July to raise money for research, and with the support of our family, she decided to undertake the daunting task of competing in and completing the race. While Kris is training hard and will be prepared, it will not be easy. An Ironman competition consists of a 2.4-mile swim, a 112-mile bike course, and a 26.2-mile run. While I am glad to join my wife for 3-mile runs, I can't imagine myself competing in this event. So, I will be rooting her on from the sidelines in Lake Placid and look forward to seeing her cross the finish line. This week, I attended the Multiple Myeloma Research Foundation Charity Classic in Washington, D.C., and spoke with survivors and patient advocates. My family and I are committed to raising awareness of this disease, and we look forward to the day a cure is found. You can learn more about Kris's efforts and training in Women's Running. Pennsylvania And The First Memorial Day The town of Boalsburg, Pennsylvania is in Centre County and has a population fewer than 4,000. It sits in a beautiful valley in the shadow of Mt. Nittany. Boalsburg claims to be the birthplace of Memorial Day - as do about two dozen other towns across our country. Having visited and met with the people of Boalsburg, I know they are right. Legend and scholarship tell us that in the fall of 1864, three local women visited the cemetery to lay flowers on the graves of a father and son who had died in the Civil War. As the women left, they agreed to return the next year to remember not only their loved ones, but others. The following July 4, friends accompanied them. Prayers were offered. Graves were tended. No headstone was left unadorned. Their tradition continued. And in 1868, May 30 was declared Decoration Day across the country. But it wasn't until 1971 that the U.S. officially celebrated Memorial Day on the last Monday in May. The three Boalsburg ladies are the mothers of a rich American tradition and fitting tribute to those who gave their lives in defense of our country. This year, we will celebrate Memorial Day on May 25th. I will be visiting Hope Cemetery in Kutztown to attend the American Legion Post 480's Veterans Memorial Day Ceremony. Meeting with Pennsylvania veterans is a constant reminder that we owe our veterans a debt of gratitude that we can never fully repay. I encourage you to read about three Pennsylvania war heroes in my recent column here. Back To Work In The U.S. Senate I recently sat down with the Editorial Board of the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review to discuss how the Republican-led Senate is getting things done, how I am working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle, and my legislative priorities for this Congress. So far, the Senate has passed more than a dozen bipartisan bills this year. We passed the Clay Hunt Act to provide better mental health services to our returning soldiers, a bill to approve the Keystone XL Pipeline to create thousands of jobs, legislation to fix a flawed Medicare formula, a bill to give Congress a say on any final nuclear deal with Iran, and legislation that targets human traffickers and better protects the victims. The Senate also passed a budget that balances in nine years, as well as bipartisan bills which I have cosponsored that will help protect our law enforcement - for example, legislation reauthorizing the bulletproof vest grant program. The American people deserve better than how the Senate had been run in the past few years. With new leadership this year, I am working with my colleagues on both sides of the aisle to reinvigorate the Senate's legislative process and advance common sense policies that will help Pennsylvanians. You can read more about my visit to the Pittsburgh Tribune-Review here . (Photo: JC Schisler/Total Trib Media) #WeAre Penn State On Tuesday, Penn State University President Eric Barron visited my Washington, D.C. office. We discussed the economic development plan of the university, including how they are pairing researchers with advisors from their business school to develop products that can be brought to the market for consumers. Penn State is a world-class university that I am proud to represent in the Senate. I look forward to staying in touch with President Barron and continuing our relationship to advance the research and education of its students.

Our war memorials are an important physical reminder that our freedoms are not free. Sadly, veterans of the Korean War in particular are many times overlooked or forgotten. I have cosponsored H.R. 1475, the Korean War Veterans Memorial Wall of Remembrance Act, to permit a privately funded addition of a Wall of Remembrance to the Korean War Veterans Memorial. It would list the names of all members of the U.S. Armed Forces who were killed in action during the war and list the number of all American POWs and MIAs.  (Korean War Veterans Memorial) I urge the House to take action on this bill to remember the courage and sacrifice of all of those who served in the Korean War. Two additional highlights: * Service Academy Day was a complete success for prospective students and their parents to get information about our nations service academies. Read this news story, also available in the Randy in the News section below, for more: Service Academy Day offers teens, parents insight into application process  (Kane County Chronicle). * At another forum I hosted, veterans and their families had a great opportunity to hear from leadership at the Illinois VA about ongoing efforts to reform care, and to get their questions answered. Read this news story, also available in the Randy in the News section below, for more: Forum addresses Veterans Affairs Department reforms  (Kane County Chronicle) Trouble in the Skies As you may know, I have been concerned for many months now about the FAAs new hiring practices which have caused the agency to pass over the most qualified air traffic controller candidates, such as experienced veterans, and have raised concerns of air travel safety. This week, I was featured in a six month investigation  which, among other things, uncovered allegations that the newest air traffic control recruits had access to answers on a key test that helped them gain jobs with the FAA.   Click the picture to watch my latest interview  As a former member of the House Subcommittee on Aviation, I have renewed my call begun in December for FAA officials to appear before Congress  to explain their actions. The latest report elevates the need to dig deeper to find out what the FAA is hiding. The American people must know if the FAA has put the safety and security of our skies first, before any other aims they may have in their hiring processes. * Did the FAA know someone on the inside was helping people cheat, and did they cover it up? * Was it a tactic with a purpose: to ensure targeted populations would pass the test * Who wrote the personality test (a.k.a. the Biographical Questionnaire), and who validated it (if anyone)? * What happens to those who have now aged out of the hiring process for which they spent countless personal resources? I also am also urging the House to act on my legislation, H.R. 1964, the Air Traffic Controllers Hiring Act of 2015  (a.k.a. the SAFE TOWERS Act), to reverse the effects of the FAAs policies. Success: House Passes Two of My Bills Our national labs like Illinois Fermilab and Argonne are the hubs of technology and manufacturing innovation. I was thrilled the House took up and passed two of my bills to help push their research and development out into the marketplace, and put America at the forefront of technological advancement and job creation: * H.R. 874, the American Super Computing Leadership Act of 2015, would jumpstart research into high-performance computing technologies to ensure continued American leadership in advanced computing. The legislation passed the House last year but died in the Senate. This year, Senator Lamar Alexander (R-TN) introduced similar legislation. * H.R.1158, the Department of Energy Laboratory Modernization and Technology Transfer Act of 2015, would bring the United States national lab system into the 21st century and promote the easy transfer of federal research into the private sector to bring to the marketplace. The bill passed the House last year but died in the Senate. This year, Senators Marco Rubio (R-FL) and Chris Coons (D-DE) introduced similar legislation. With renewed energy in Senate, I look forward to both pieces of legislation becoming law soon. Key Legislative Action: Freezing Congressional Pay, Protecting Unborn, Ending NSA Data Collection, Defending Religious Liberty and More 1. Did you know the United States is one of only seven nations to allow abortion on-demand after 20 weeks, placing us in the company of human-rights violators such as China and North Korea? Regardless of ones views on abortion, majorities of Americans agree that the gruesome killing of unborn children at five monthswho can feel painshould be barred. I supported House passage  of a bill I cosponsored to do just that. 2. I have consistently opposed the NSAs overreach and have voted in the past to end or defund the agencys bulk data collection program. I supported House passage  of H.R. 2048, the USA FREEDOM Act, which protects civil liberties, ends bulk data collection, and includes key national security provisions. 3. Religious minorities like Yazidis, Shabaks, Christians and others have suffered tremendously at the hands of ISIS. Many times, these victims fleeing their homelands in a hurry are without official documentsmaking it almost impossible to enter a neighboring country. I cosponsored  H.R. 1568, the Protecting Religious Minorities Persecuted by ISIS Act of 2015, to provide direct relief to displaced religious minorities. 4. Repeatedly Iran has shown a clear intention to impose its extremist views upon all Iranians, regardless of their faith. I urged senior congressional leaders to reauthorize  the Lautenberg Amendment that preserves a secure pathway to asylum for these persecuted religious groups. 5. Since I entered office in 2011, the House has worked hard to practice our own fiscal responsibility as a legislative body. I supported the passage  of H.R. 2250, the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, which maintains the pay freeze for Members of Congress since 2011, among other provisions. 6. Through cooperative federalism, states like Illinois can use public-private partnerships to develop hubs of innovation that will ultimately create manufacturing and other jobs, and grow the local economy. I helped secure the inclusion  of local technology-driven manufacturing and economic development program in an appropriations bill which would support regional innovation ecosystems across the country, including in Illinois. 7. Illinois businesses are burdened enough by unnecessary and duplicative paperwork. Consistent standards across our nations financial regulatory agencies would ensure modernized communications among regulators, and between regulators and financial institutions and businesses. I cosponsored  H.R. 2477, the Financial Transparency Act of 2015, to ensure regulators like the SEC adopt open, searchable and consistent data reporting standards. 8. The commercial space industry represents hundreds of billions in economic investment and thousands of jobs nationwide. Illinois own Cain Tubular and Scot Forge create parts for rocket engines and launch systems. I supported House passage  of a bill I cosponsored, H.R. 2262, the Spurring Private Aerospace Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship (SPACE) Act, which will support the growth of the commercial space sector while also providing a smart regulatory environment to protect national security and public safety. 9. Municipal bonds are a lifeline to Illinois communities looking to expand a high school or repair their infrastructure. I cosponsored  H.R. 2229, the Municipal Bond Market Support Act, to expand this Main Street financing tool. 10. Two of my bills introduced were passed out of the Financial Services Committee with bipartisan support: H.R. 1975, the Securities and Exchange Commission Overpayment Credit Act (passed 57-0) and H.R. 1675, the Encouraging Employee Ownership Act (passed 45-15). Small Business Week Highlights During National Small Business Week, I stopped by successful small businesses throughout the 14th District. Heres just one highlighted on my Facebook page: Acres Group, a family-owned business in Wauconda  , which has been in business since 1983.

[R-GA12]","Friend, As we prepare to observe Memorial Day, please join me in remembering our fallen servicemen and women and their heroic contributions to our nation. This Monday, it is important for all of us to reflect upon the sacrifices of the fallen and the freedoms for which they fought. May we continue to honor their legacy of courage, patriotism, and selfless service. As we remember those who made the ultimate sacrifice, we also salute all the brave men and women who have served and continue to defend our nation at home and abroad. To the fallen, our veterans, active service members, and their families, we thank you. Part of our duty to our heroes who have served and returned home is ensuring they receive the care and benefits they were promised and have earned. As we continue working to fix the problems that have plagued the VA, the House took steps this week to pass meaningful reforms that help veterans and strengthen VA accountability. I also encourage veterans in the 12th district who have faced challenges with the VA to visit and share your experience. Hearing your stories is critical to our efforts in Congress to offer solutions that ensure our veterans receive the treatment they deserve. One of the reasons I ran for office is to bring real world business experience to Congress. A lesson many in Washington still need to learn is that our economy is driven by growth in the private sector, not the federal government. This week, I spoke in support of legislation that would make the Research and Development Tax Credit permanent in order to foster innovation and opportunity. I was pleased the House passed this commonsense bill that provides American entrepreneurs certainty to invest, create jobs, and fuel economic growth.

,114,Male,N00028463,43494,"Roe, David “Phil” (Rep.) [R-TN1]","Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to join my friend and colleague, Southwest Virginia Rep. Morgan Griffith, at the Virginia Coal and Energy Alliances annual meeting in Kingsport. Coal is an important source of domestic energy. Did you know that coal provides nearly 40 percent of Americas electricity and is used in 48 states? In fact, the United States has more coal than any other country. Despite the abundance of this key resource, the Obama administration is determined to bankrupt the coal industry. In 2008, then-Senator Obama touted his opposition of the coal industry to the San Francisco Chronicle saying, If somebody wants to open a coal-powered plant, they can. Its just that I will bankrupt them. Last year, President Obama unveiled a controversial Clean Power Plan to cut carbon emissions from existing coal-powered plants 30% by 2030. This approach to curbing emissions is so unpopular with Congress and the American people that the president couldnt get a Democrat-controlled House and Senate to pass a similar planthe infamous Cap-and-Tax billback in 2009. According to the American Coalition for Clean Coal Electricity, the coal industry has invested nearly $120 billion to reduce emissions by 90 percent, but the administration is determined to push the standards to unachievable levels. In fact, the Administration punishes the industry when it reduces emissions voluntarily by not counting emissions reductions that have been achieved towards future targets. It seems clear to anyone who has been paying attention to the EPA that the goal of their regulations is not to reduce emissions  its to end the use of coal as an energy source. While I agree that we should be good stewards of the environment, its foolish to punish an industry that Americans depend on, particularly when many other countries  particularly China  are continuing to build coal-fired power plants to meet their energy needs. I am skeptical of the presidents claim that the rest of the world will follow our example on implementing similar standards. The presidents proposal wont just affect the coal industry; consumers also lose under this proposal. Some studies predict that there will be double-digit electricity rate hikes in 43 states, with 14 states seeing increases of more than 20 percent. Going into the summer months, many American families count on electricity to cool their homes. At a time when many are still struggling to make ends meet, its reckless to push policies that will burden families with higher electric bills. In Tennessee, 34 percent of families live below the poverty line. These families spend roughly 22 percent of their income on energy. They are the ones who will be left behind by this plan. In February, I joined 43 of my colleagues in writing to Cheryl LaFleur, the Chairman of the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission, encouraging her to continue studying the effects of the presidents proposal. The letter, led by Reps. Brett Guthrie and Gregg Harper, also raised concerns about the cost and availability of affordable electricity in extreme temperatures, particularly during cold winter months. I support an all-of-the-above energy plan, one that includes fossil fuels and renewables. Coal must be part of our energy portfolio, not just for the reliable energy that it generates, but the good jobs that it provides. I remain adamantly opposed to the presidents Clean Power Plan and will continue to look for ways to protecting the hardworking families that rely on affordable, coal-generated energy.

In general, I believe the government is spending too much, as evidenced by our current debt crisis. However, there are projects that are very effective and deserving of our revenues, and our nation's infrastructure is one. Infrastructure spending provides an almost unparalleled return on taxpayer investment, as it not only employs thousands of Arkansans, but modern infrastructure also encourages businesses to set up shop in Arkansas. MAP-21 was the last transportation bill passed, and that was back in 2012. We desperately need a modern, updated version that addresses our country's currently crumbling infrastructure, and perhaps no one knows that better than the Arkansans who live in the 1st District. We on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee have been working on a long-term, fully-funded comprehensive bill so we can stop passing short-term patches. We have a pretty good idea of what that bill would like, and are working as hard as we can to prepare it for passage. All of us on the Committee agree that a long-term, preferably 5-year, bill is the goal. The challenge weve encountered is the insolvency of the Highway Trust Fund. Our debt crisis continues to overextend precious resources for critical projects and it leaves few options at our immediate disposal, many which are not palatable in this economic environment. To be successful, a long-term solution must combine a consistent funding mechanism with financial transparency. Our current system, through shortfalls and opaque applications of funding, has lost the trust of Americans, who dont know where or how their tax dollars are being invested. People in Arkansas don't want their taxes to go towards urban public transportation in other states; they rightly want their money invested in the highways they rely on everyday. Currently, the primary financier of the trust fund is the federal gas tax, which has remained the same since 1993. Meanwhile, cars have become more efficient and people are driving less, so the fund isn't being replenished at the rate it once was. Both the Transportation and Ways and Means Committees will have to consider new, creative funding alternatives to find a fiscally sustainable solution to this chronic problem. At this point, the focus is on finding one or more consistent funding mechanisms, a way to regularly and reliably fund our programs. Since my Committee only authorizes transportation programs, the Ways and Means Committee is responsible for finding how to pay for it. The trust fund was set to expire on May 31, but in order to allow more time to find a more permanent fix, we passed a two-month patch to keep the trust fund afloat. Passage of the patch, HR 2353, was critical in preventing the shutdown of current infrastructure improvement. Im hopeful the extra time the patch allows will be used wisely by Chairman Ryan and the rest of Ways and Means to find a reliable funding source. There is a shared commitment between the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and most members of the House to passing a fully-funded multi-year highway bill, but that commitment must bear the fruit of action. Failure to act threatens our general contractors and their employees, suppliers, and puts at risk the jobs that are both directly and indirectly supported by these projects.

Memorial Day & A New National Cemetery I began this Memorial Day weekend with a very special event: the dedication of a new National Cemetery for veterans right here in North Florida. It was an honor to speak at the dedication and present this flag that flew over Arlington National Cemetery to the veterans in our community.  There will be sad days here for families saying good bye to loved ones -- but there will also forever be pride, respect and honor for all those buried here. This weekend is a reverent time for all of us to pay our respects and remember those who gave the ultimate sacrifice serving our country. Rural Outreach In Jackson, Gadsden, Jefferson and Leon counties, a disaster loan application deadline is approaching for small businesses, agricultural cooperatives and aquaculture businesses, as well as most private nonprofit organizations affected by drought.

As a member of the Congressional Caucus on Foster Youth and a strong advocate for adoption and foster care, I joined many of my colleagues in the Congressional Foster Youth Shadow Day. Each year, a group of foster youth comes from across the United States to Washington, D.C. to shadow a member of Congress for a day, tell their stories, and advocate for improvements to the nation's foster care system. I was joined by Maria Altidor, from Richmond, Virginia, for a day. Originally from Port au Prince, Haiti, she is an amazing young woman with a bright future. Her story is incredibly inspiring, and serves as a true testament to the power of faith and the need for those who have dedicated their professional careers and personal lives to ensuring these young people find love, protection and stability with a permanent family. We know that when children grow up in stable households, they are much more likely to succeed as adults; and I am committed to ensuring that every child has a safe, supportive and permanent family.  Vicky and Maria Altidor on Congressional Foster Youth Shadow Day On a different note, I spoke at a press conference this week in support of a bill to repeal the United States mandatory Country-of-Origin Labeling law, which requires retailers to label certain meat products with language stating what country the meat is from. This week the World Trade Organization sided with Canada and Mexico in their final challenge of the COOL law, saying it violates our international trade obligations. Unless we do something now, this ruling allows these countries to seek retaliation for billions of dollars in damages and paves the way for these countries to impose steep tariffs on our goods. Canada has already issued a preliminary retaliation list targeting various commodities and manufactured products that would affect every state in the U.S. Missouri alone could face tariffs ranging from $623 million on exports  including beef, machine parts, and prepared foods. I was pleased to see House Agriculture Committee Chairman Mike Conaway move quickly to bring up legislation to repeal this troublesome law. This bill will restore stability for the United States by bringing us back into compliance with established trade rules. We must do all we can to avoid retaliation from our two biggest trading partners, and full repeal of COOL is the only solution.  (click to play video) Vicky speaks out in support of COOL repeal to avoid costly retaliation measures from Canada and Mexico that could cost Americans billions of dollars in economic impact. Finally, this weekend marks the traditional start of the summer vacation season, but Memorial Day weekend must remain a time to pay tribute to America's fallen heroes who gave their last full measure of devotion preserving our freedoms. In Congress, we have made our nations veterans a priority, having passed bills to get more veterans hired (Hire More Heroes Act of 2015  ), prevent veteran suicide (Clay Hunt SAV Act  ), improve access to and quality of medical care (The Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act  ), and ensure the VA remains accountable and provides the best care possible to those who have served (Recouping Bonuses and Awards Paid to Employees of the VA  ). This week we passed another series of six bills aimed at better serving our nations veterans and building on our promise to ensure our veterans receive the care they deserve in return for all they have sacrificed. Included in this package: The Veteran's I.D. Card Act  a bill I co-sponsored, would ensure veterans have timely access to proper identification while streamlining the process of obtaining proof of military service; The Ensuring VA Employee Accountability Act  would require all written reprimands and admonishments given to a VA employee remain in their file as long as they are an employee of the Department in order to better hold VA employees accountable for their behavior; The Vulnerable Veterans Housing Reform Act  would reduce veteran homelessness by reforming how the Department of Housing and Urban Development provides housing assistance for disabled veterans. While there is always more to be done, including reforms to bring the VA into the 21st century, these six bills thank our veterans for their service and work to improve their lives and the lives of those veterans who will come after them. This weekend, as we honor those who have given the ultimate sacrifice in service to this great nation, let us pledge to never take for granted those freedoms they died to preserve.

senior,"113,114,115",Female,N00027694,412243,"McCaskill, Claire (Sen.) [D-MO]","#letter_header {margin-top:0px !important} Dear Friend, As we celebrate Memorial Day with family and friends, I encourage you to think about all the brave men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for our country. I know my family, as we honor all of our men and women in uniform, will be thinking of my dad who proudly served in World War II - a role he rarely discussed. And much like my dad, Kirkwood Vietnam War Veteran Gene Haltenhof never sought out the recognition he deserved. Thankfully, after more than forty years that has finally changed. This week, Former U.S. Army Captain Haltenhof was presented with an Air Medal with Numeral ""25"" in recognition of hours flown in hostile airspace. During his service, he was awarded a Bronze Star and the Distinguished Flying Cross for his heroism in the evacuation of Fire Support Base Ripcord, but an administrative oversight kept him from receiving the Air Medal. This administrative oversight was a wrong my staff and I were thrilled to play a role in correcting - it's one of the best parts of my job. I was privileged to help Captain Haltenhof, because it's important we continue to keep our promises to veterans long after they return from the battlefield. This is a promise that also includes our four-legged heroes. Last week, when the Senate Armed Services Committee - a committee on which I proudly serve - passed the annual defense bill, it included a provision I championed to ensure service members who handle service dogs are at the front of the line to adopt the dogs when they're retired from duty. There are many issues facing our returning troops, and this is one that remained dear to my heart. I've heard directly from veterans who want to be reunited with the friend they served with and who at times kept them out of harm's way, much like a Kansas City Iraq War Veteran who reached out to me about his dog Diego and what reuniting them would mean to him. It was a great day when that moment finally came for Logan Black and Diego.

[R-GA9]","Congressman Doug Collins Dear Lindsey,  Memorial Day is an occasion to commemorate our fallen soldiers, men and women who gave their lives to preserve our freedom in this country. That's why, on Monday, Northeast Georgia will lower its flags to half-staff and raise them again at noon -- symbolic of the sacrifices our military members have made and also the God-given liberty we enjoy, because of their bravery.  On Monday, I'll be at Lula's remembrance ceremony, encouraging America's next generation to appreciate the valor of those who died in conflicts from the Civil War -- when Memorial Day first began -- to World War II and the present day, as troops return from Iraq and Afghanistan.  This week in Congress, I introduced a House resolution recognizing the daisy as the national flower of military caregivers [link 2], the unsung heroes of our armed forces, who will help them heal from war. And I voted for measures to increase U.S. military veterans' access to health care and job training.  As an Air Force Reserve chaplain, who served in Iraq, I know the troubles many troops will encounter at home, especially when they remember friends they left on the battlefield.

[R-OH]","  Constituent Services  Issues & Legislation  Newsroom  About Ohio  About Rob  Connect  Last Saturday, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio) participated in the 170th Commencement exercises at Wittenberg University in Springfield for the graduating Class of 2015.  ""Wittenberg is an extraordinary institution with an exceptional history of producing leaders since it first opened its doors in 1845,"" Portman said. ""I was honored to be at Wittenberg to be a part of such a special occasion for the graduates, their families, and the entire Wittenberg community for the 170th commencement to celebrate the class of 2015. Many of the graduates may think this is the end of a journey. The truth is, after a world-class educational experience at Wittenberg, this is just the beginning."" On Monday, Portman hosted a roundtable at the Chalmers P. Wylie VA Ambulatory Care Center to focus on mental health treatment for veterans. The Columbus VA Care Center houses a local mental health treatment clinic. Portman recently introduced the Medical Evaluation Parity for Servicemembers (MEPS) Act  , legislation which will improve the way the military identifies and assesses mental health issues. The MEPS Act would institute mental health assessments for incoming recruits and also ensure servicemembers separating from active duty receive screenings as well. Portman also continues to urge  the Department of Veteran Affairs to establish inpatient care for veterans in the Central Ohio region. With no Columbus location, veterans and their families are currently forced to travel across the state to Cincinnati and Dayton to receive inpatient care. Portman's recommendation comes in response from direct feedback from Columbus-area veterans during a series of town hall meetings he hosted over the past summer to focus on VA issues.  Watch coverage of the event here  . On Tuesday, Portman, co-chair of the Senate Caucus to End Human Trafficking, announced three of his bills to combat human trafficking, the Bringing Missing Children Home Act, the Ensuring a Better Response for Victims of Child Sex Trafficking, and major provisions of the Combat Human Trafficking Act are headed to the President for signature  . These passed the House and Senate as part of the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, a bipartisan and comprehensive trafficking bill introduced by U.S. Senator John Cornyn (R-TX). ""Today marks an important step in the fight to end this form of modern-day slavery,"" Portman stated. ""My measures included in the trafficking bill will allow us to improve the way we find missing children, strengthen the prosecution against buyers of sex acts from trafficking victims, rightly define victims of child sex trafficking as victims of child abuse and ensure that children who are sex trafficked or sexually exploited are treated as victims, not criminals. We have a duty to protect the most vulnerable among us, and I'm pleased these critical measures will now be law so that we can work to end this heinous crime.""  The Bringing Missing Children Home Act  is bipartisan legislation Portman introduced with Senator Chuck Schumer (D-NY) to improve the way we find missing kids by refining and streamlining how cases of missing children are handled and enhancing the critical information needed for law enforcement to investigate cases of missing and abducted children. Specifically, for the first time ever, law enforcement will be required to add a photograph to the missing child's file if available. Portman's bill also replaces the term ""child prostitution"" with ""child sex trafficking,"" reinforcing that children who are sex trafficked or sexually exploited are victims, not criminals, and making it clear that we must save these children from abuse. Ensuring a Better Response for Victims of Child Sex Trafficking was originally part of the Child Sex Trafficking Data and Response Act  , bipartisan legislation Portman introduced with Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR) to amend the Child Abuse Prevention and Treatment Act (CAPTA) to require that child victims of sex trafficking are considered victims of child abuse. Under the amendment, CAPTA state plans must also contain provisions and procedures requiring identification and assessment of all reports involving children known or suspected to be victims of sex trafficking, training for child protective services workers to identify and provide comprehensive services victims and a description of efforts to coordinate with state law enforcement, juvenile justice, and social service agencies such as runaway and homeless youth shelters to better serve victims of sex trafficking. The Combat Human Trafficking Act  is bipartisan legislation Portman introduced with Sen. Dianne Feinstein (D-CA) to strengthen law enforcement efforts to investigate and prosecute all who commit sex trafficking crimes, particularly the buyers of sex acts from trafficking victims. Enforcement efforts often focus on prosecuting the sellers of these acts because of challenges in prosecuting buyers. Portman's legislation sends a clear message to those who victimize children that we will prosecute them to the full extent of the law. By strengthening laws against buyers, we can take steps toward reducing demand for child victims and ensuring criminals are fully prosecuted. Also on Tuesday, Portman and Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) offered an amendment addressing currency manipulation  to the Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) legislation. The amendment, authored by Portman and U.S. Sen. Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and cosponsored by Brown, puts teeth into addressing currency manipulation by holding countries accountable to International Monetary Fund standards. It would add explicit and enforceable currency language necessary to ensure that foreign competitors don't use their exchange rates to subsidize their exports at the expense of products made by American workers. The amendment is backed by American auto companies and manufacturers such as Ford, GM, FCA, U.S. Steel, Nucor, and AK Steel. ""When foreign competitors tilt the playing field by manipulating their currencies, Ohio workers suffer,"" Portman stated. ""That means American-made exports are more expensive, while our competitors' exports into the United States are cheaper. That's not fair for American workers who can compete with anyone on a level playing field. I'm pleased to introduce this bipartisan amendment that cracks down on currency manipulation to ensure that our trade negotiators treat currency rules just as seriously as other negotiating objectives laid out by Congress."" Portman and Brown also offered an amendment that would level the playing field for U.S. industries  - like the steel industry - by increasing their ability to fight back against unfair foreign trade practices. Last week, the Senate passed the Leveling the Playing Field Act with bipartisan support as part of the U.S. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) reauthorization. ""Ohio workers can compete and win globally, but we must ensure that the playing field is fair,"" Portman stated. ""I'm pleased to support this amendment that says we must hold foreign competitors accountable when they skirt the rules.""  Video of Portman discussing these amendments on the Senate floor can be found here  . On Wednesday, Portman introduced the State Transportation Flexibility Act  , legislation that would allow state transportation departments to opt out of the Federal-Aid Highway and Mass Transit programs and direct more gas tax revenues into priority road and bridge projects. This will give these states the freedom to manage and spend the gas tax revenue collected within their states on transportation projects without federal mandates, while ensuring that the current Interstate System is maintained by the states. ""This legislation will help to ensure high priority road and bridge projects, such as the Brent Spence Bridge in my hometown of Cincinnati, are completed by giving states the freedom to use highway revenue how they see fit and reducing federal regulations that slow down progress,"" Portman stated. ""The one-size-fits-all approach isn't working, and by returning power to the states, we can put transportation funding on a sustainable path.""  View Cincinnati's FOX 19 coverage of the legislation here  . The State Transportation Flexibility Act will put transportation on a path toward fiscal stability and give states the flexibility they need to innovate and better align transportation projects with their state and local needs. A one-page summary of the legislation can be found here  . Also on Wednesday, Portman again urged passage of his bipartisan amendment  to crack down on currency manipulation that hurts Ohio exports. The amendment puts teeth into addressing currency manipulation by holding countries accountable when they tilt the playing field against American workers through currency practices.  Video of Portman's remarks can be found here  . On Thursday, Portman introduced the Microbeads Free Waters Act of 2015  , legislation that would address plastic microbeads which are found in common household products and are detrimental to wildlife and human health. Because of the detrimental effect microbeads have on our natural resources, companies have already agreed to phase them out of production. This bipartisan legislation would implement a commonsense way for companies across the country to do so on a level playing field by establishing a definition of microbeads and setting uniform dates for the prohibition of manufacture and sale of products. The bill was coauthored by U.S. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand (D-NY) and cosponsored by Senators Debbie Stabenow (D-Mich.) and Mark Kirk (R-Ill.) ""Plastic microbeads are devastating to wildlife and human health, and this bill implements a commonsense way to phase them out in a way that's fair to Ohio companies and keeps them on a level playing field with their competitors,"" Portman stated. ""Lake Erie is not only one of our precious natural resources, it's also essential for Ohio jobs and tourism, and our legislation takes appropriate steps to protect this important asset for Ohio."" Microbeads are tiny synthetic plastic particles used as an abrasive in many personal-care and beauty products, such as facial scrubs, soaps and toothpastes. When consumers use products containing microbeads, the microbeads don't dissolve, but instead are rinsed down the drain. Because of the small size and buoyancy of microbeads, they escape treatment by sewage plants and are discharged into lakes and rivers.  Watch coverage of the legislation here  . Also on Thursday, Portman and Senator Al Franken (D-Minn.) introduced a bipartisan bill  to make sure that young people and veterans who have faced homelessness don't have to make the difficult choice between a place to call home and a good education. This important legislative fix would close a loophole that prevents many full-time students-including veterans-from qualifying for affordable rental housing funded through a key tax credit. Sens. Portman and Franken's proposal would allow youth and veterans who experience or have recently experienced homelessness to become eligible for low-income housing while they attend school full-time. ""Students shouldn't have to choose between stable housing and going to school full-time,"" said Portman. ""By giving low-income students access to affordable housing while they attend school, we can help to ensure that they are able to graduate and succeed."" Read a summary of the bill and view a list of endorsers here  . Portman, Congressman Brad Wenstrup (R-OH-2), and Congressman Bill Johnson (R-OH-06) on Thursday demanded that the Department of Energy (DOE)  detail its plan for avoiding disruptions in the decontamination and decommissioning (D&D) operations at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant following a unilateral decision by DOE to place new restrictions on a program that has been critical to funding work at the site. This environmental clean-up and restoration work employs nearly 2,000 individuals and is critically important to southern Ohio. ""In recent years, the D&D operations at Piketon have been supplemented by the sale of excess uranium,"" the lawmakers wrote. ""Your previous secretarial determination covered transfers up to the equivalent of 2,055 metric tons of natural uranium (MTU) per year, in natural uranium hexafluoride provided to contractors for cleanup services at the Portsmouth Gaseous Diffusion Plant. The 2015 determination, however, reduces covered transfers down to 1,600 MTU for the 2016 calendar year, creating a shortfall of 455 MTU. We respectfully request that DOE explain, in detail, how workforce disruptions will be avoided in 2016 given the potential funding shortfalls described above."" Text of the letter can be found here  . Portman also announced this week that the Senate-drafted Fiscal Year 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) and the Senate Appropriations Bill for Military Construction includes critical funding for a number of Ohio military assets, including: * $9.4 million for an upgrade to the indoor firing range facility at the Youngstown Air Reserve Station (YARS)  , home to the 910th Airlift Wing; * $3.3 million for an upgrade to the Ravenna Joint Military Training Center  firing range in Ravenna, Ohio; * $6.6 million to construct a new satellite pharmacy at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base  . On Friday, Portman urged the Administration to help Iraqi Christians and other religious minorities  fleeing violence and persecution in Iraq and seeking to come to the United States. The U.S. Consulate in Erbil does not currently process immigrant visas, forcing Iraqi Christians to make the life-threatening and virtually impossible journey through ISIS-controlled territory to reach the U.S. Embassy in Baghdad. In a letter to Secretary of State John Kerry, Portman asked the Administration to begin allowing the Consulate in Erbil to process visas and to take adequate steps in addressing the needs of the growing refugee population in Kurdistan. ""We understand the U.S. policy regarding a unified Iraq,"" the senators wrote. ""However, allowing for the processing of immigrant visas in the place where the majority of the people seeking them live strikes us as a common-sense response to an urgent humanitarian crisis, not an effort to undermine U.S. support for a unified Iraqi state. Visa processing times are already notoriously slow, and allowing immigrant visas to be processed in Erbil could help alleviate this problem. It would also demonstrate to the U.S. Senate, the refugee population, and the world that the United States government is committed to helping the thousands Christians, Yazidis, and other religious minorities who have suffered enormously because of their faith."" The Islamic State has forced Christians in the territory it controls to flee their homes, convert to Islam, or face execution. With over one million people displaced by the violence in Iraq, the situation remains critical, and the targeted harassment, persecution, and killings of Iraqi religious minorities by the Islamic State continues. Text of the letter can be found here  . On Social Media:     Portman runs for wounded soldiers Day to day your elected officials can be seen at the U.S. Capitol. But these lawmakers are trading the floor, for the pavement. Senator Rob Portman of Ohio was dubbed fastest Senator last year and was back again to reclaim his title. ""It's like being the best surfer in Kansas, it's a dubious distinction,"" Portman said. But for Senator Portman and other members of Congress it is more than just a race. ""I participated in the last few years and my whole staff comes out here. We have two teams of five each, so it's a great effort to try and help our wounded warriors,"" he added. The ACLI Capitol Challenge is an annual race that raises money for the Fidelco Guide Dog Foundation, giving new hope to men and women blinded during their time serving in the military. ""Lieutenant Brad Snyder he was injured by an IED in Afghanistan and blinded him and yet he's out here today with his guide dog Gizzy. He actually ran in the race today, so it's a good cause and I'm really delighted to support it,"" Portman said. (""Portman runs for wounded soldiers,"" Staff. ABC 13 - Toledo  . May 20, 2015.)  Portman's 'pilot project' aimed at better health for seniors Members of the board of Menorah Park Center for Senior Living in Beachwood said they liked U.S. Sen. Rob Portman's presentation of his new ""pilot project,"" based on his Better Health Rewards legislation. Better Health Rewards is a Medicare program that helps seniors set and meet goals designed to improve their health and well-being. ""We appreciate what Sen. Portman is doing to support the senior citizens,"" said Ken Bravo, chair of Menorah Park's government relations committee, ""and it begins with the residents of Menorah Park."" ""I chose Menorah Park because it is cutting-edge, and is one of the finest facilities of its kind in the country based on an independent rating,"" said Portman, a Republican from suburban Cincinnati who lived in Shaker Heights until he was 5 years old. ""These seniors are good shoppers,"" Portman said of senior citizens. ""They're smart, competitive, and certainly able to take care of themselves with some added incentives."" The program rewards those who reach their health goals and lowers overall health costs by giving them a chance to share in the savings. The voluntary, three- year project ties ""wellness visits"" to goals, rewarding those who meet the goals. Under the program, participating providers would use information gathered during annual wellness visits to establish achievable health goals for participating patients. ""I consider Menorah Park a pilot program for what we are trying to do,"" said Portman. ""Under Medicare you have an annual visit, and during that annual visit on a voluntary basis you would be allowed to partake in an incentive program to improve your health."" The Better Health Rewards program is based on the notion that improvements in senior health would save Medicare money. Portman seemed confident in the efficiency and effectiveness of the program, and he hopes to spread the program across the country in the near future. ""We appreciate the wonderful partnership with you, and we thank you for developing such an innovative national model,"" said Richard Schwalberg, Menorah Park administrator. ""We look forward to serving as the model site."" (""Portman's 'pilot project' aimed at better health for seniors,"" Taylor Rosen. Cleveland Jewish Times  . May 19, 2015.)  Portman finds support for military mental-health screening While spending a large part of three decades homeless and on the streets after leaving the Marine Corps, Craig Neuvirth knew something was off. But, his mental health problems were worse than he had been told - worse than the case of post-traumatic stress disorder not diagnosed until a decade after his three years in the military. His life might have been different had he received a mental-health screening upon leaving active duty. A bill proposed by Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio would require mental-health assessments for incoming recruits to establish a baseline and then also mandate assessments when service members leave the military. Too many veterans, particularly from the Iraq and Afghanistan conflicts, are departing the military with undetected illnesses such as post-traumatic stress disorder, Portman says. ""It's not an easy issue to work on,"" Portman said during a roundtable discussion yesterday at the VA health center. ""It's the invisible wounds of war ... our system still has some significant gaps."" Portman joined Sen. Martin Heinrich, D-N.M., in introducing the Medical Evaluation Parity for Servicemembers Act in March to help detect mental illness among veterans earlier and more effectively. Dr. Chrisanne Gordon, who founded the Resurrecting Lives Foundation to assist veterans dealing with traumatic brain injuries, said the military too often fails to answer the question, ""Who do we have here?"" when service members depart. ""We're dealing with consequences of honor ... thanks for helping to bring this problem to the forefront,"" she told Portman. Language in the pending Pentagon budget would instruct the military to prepare to do the evaluations to be established in his bill, Portman said. (""Portman finds support for military mental-health screening,"" Emma Ockerman. Columbus Dispatch  . May 18, 2015.)  Federal bill would name VA center for fallen Ohio soldier Legislation to honor an Ohio solider who died in the Vietnam War by naming a Veterans Affairs clinic for him has been introduced in Congress. Senators Sherrod Brown and Rob Portman introduced a bill this past week in the Senate to designate the U. S. Department of Veterans Affairs clinic in Newark as the Daniel L. Kinnard Department of Veterans Affairs Community Based Outpatient Clinic. The senators said in a statement that Kinnard served as a medic in Vietnam and was awarded a Bronze Star for tending to wounded men in his unit while under fire. The legislation is supported by various veterans groups in Ohio. (""Federal bill would name VA center for fallen Ohio soldier,"" Associated Press  May 16, 2015.)  Vienna air reserve station closes in on project funding The air reserve station in Vienna is closer to getting the money it needs for an improvement project. U.S. Senator Rob Portman announced Thursday that over $9 million has been approved in a bill for military construction, according to a release from Portman's office. The release states that the Air Force included the funding in its budget proposal and the Senate has taken the first step in approving that proposal with today's news. (""Vienna air reserve station closes in on project funding,"" Jonathan Stroshine. WKBN 27  May 21, 2015.)  Give All Students a Chance to Walk Across the Stage College graduations are being held across the country. They are a time for celebration and remind us of the importance of higher education. During this season, it can be hard to imagine not being able to go to college. But the reality is, college study still remains out of reach for many. Rising college costs can be intimidating, and the weight of mounting debt can turn students away altogether. There are approximately 300 early college high schools nationwide, and 14 in Ohio. Research conducted by Columbia University shows that early college participants are significantly more likely to complete high school, enroll in college, and earn college degrees. In addition, early college high schools save money for students and their families by allowing students to complete up to two years of college credits while still in high school. These savings range from approximately $27,200 up to $72,600 for two years of college tuition at public and private colleges, respectively. In Ohio, we've seen the success of these programs firsthand. Founded in 2013, the Dayton Early College Academy (DECA) was Ohio's first early college high school program. DECA operates as a nontraditional charter high school and has served 465 students in its first full school year. In 2014, 100 percent of DECA'S graduates were college-bound or serving in the military, and 95 percent of the graduates entered Ohio colleges or universities. Simply put, early college works. More students have access to a college education because of these programs. Although free to students and families, school districts often cannot support early college programs due to tuition costs, causing program instability. So, we introduced the Go to High School, Go to College Act to expand education opportunities to more young Americans and support school districts and programs. Specifically, our bill allows low-income students enrolled in early colleges to use Pell Grants to help pay for college while maintaining accountability. This way we can work to ensure every dollar spent on earned college credits protects students and increases the effectiveness of the Pell Grant program. We know Congress can and should do more to help students get to college. Based on proven models of success, the Go to High School, Go to College Act is commonsense legislation to allow more students access to higher education. A lack of financial resources should not prevent America's students from achieving a college degree. So, as we celebrate the class of 2015, let's look forward to the next generation. Let's give every student a chance to walk across the stage. (""Give All Students a Chance to Walk Across the Stage,"" Marcia L. Fudge and Rob Portman. Diverse Education  . May 20, 2015.)

[R-WA8]","Dear Friends, Since we talked last, from Issaquah to Wenatchee to DC, I have been taking meetings, hearing from constituents, and joining my colleagues in passing critical legislation. Earlier this month, we announced the winners of the 8th District Congressional Art Competition at our annual reception  the amount of talent exhibited was amazing, just like every year. I was also privileged to visit Mission Ridge Elementary School, Whitworth University, and Seattle University where I met bright, eager students at both the end and the beginning of their schooling. While I have the opportunity to talk with them about my experiences and about perseverance and leadership, learning from them is just as important. I also met with small business owners and business leaders around the District as well as a larger group of them when I spoke to the Rotary Club of Ellensburg. Last week was Police Week. This is the time of year that we remember all the sacrifices the men and women who wear the badge make to keep all of us safe. These are the men and women whose experiences were my own for 33 years, I know what it is to lose a partner and a friend in the line of duty and I know what it is for my family not to know if or when they would see me again. It was my distinct honor, then, to help secure the passage of the Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu National Blue Alert Act of 2015, co-authored with New Jersey Congressman Bill Pascrell and Senators Cardin and Graham, passed through both chambers of Congress (and it was signed into law earlier this week). The House also passed my legislation which would make sure that federal public safety officers can access their retirement savings penalty-free at the age of 50  just like state and local officers. And though no words or gestures can ever replace those who are gone but not forgotten, I led a moment of silence on the House floor to remember the 117 officers who gave their lives last year, and the 47 who have died this year, before attending the National Peace Officers Memorial Ceremony on the Capitol Lawn with the President the following day. This week I, with Congressman Rick Larsen, introduced bipartisan legislation to help Washingtons small businesses overcome exporting hurdles so that they can successfully gain access to new markets and create jobs here at home as well as a piece of legislation to ensure states are properly enforcing unemployment benefits law that prevents incarcerated individuals from receiving money that should be rightfully going to families fallen on hard times. As we enjoy the upcoming long weekend, we must all remember the servicemen and women who gave their lives defending us and our freedom this Memorial Day.

Please let me know your thoughts! Vern It is my honor and privilege to represent the people of Sarasota and Manatee counties, more than 70,000 of whom have served our country in uniform. That's why so much of my time and focus in Congress is spent working on issues important to veterans. I'm proud to have sponsored and passed meaningful bills that improve the health care and job prospects of veterans throughout the nation. I also fought successfully for $27 million in funding for the new national veterans cemetery in Sarasota, allowing more than 150,000 area veterans to be buried close to home with the honor and dignity they deserve. And most recently, I sponsored a bill that just passed the U.S. House last week giving all veterans in America access to a national identification card. My legislation - the Veterans ID Card Act -- will minimize the threat of identity theft for our nation's heroes. This bill (H.R. 91) would enable all of our veterans to receive their own simple, standardized identification card at no cost to the taxpayers. It would also provide employers looking to hire veterans with an easier way to verify an employee's military service as well as give veterans the ability to take advantage of service-related discounts. I have no higher priority than ensuring that our veterans receive the recognition and benefits they have earned.

[D-CA]","    May 22, 2015 Dear Friend: This week we learned the shocking news that nearly 34 million air bags made by the Takata Corporation are being recalled nationwide because of a dangerous defect that has caused at least six deaths and more than 100 injuries. Dozens of models of vehicles from automakers including Honda, BMW, Chrysler, Ford, General Motors, Mazda, Mitsubishi, Nissan, Saab, Subaru and Toyota dating back to the 2001 model year have been affected. While automakers are required to send you a recall notice if your vehicle is under recall, I encourage anyone concerned that their vehicle might be affected to go to the Transportation Department's safety recall website. By entering your Vehicle Identification Number (VIN), you can find out if your vehicle is subject to the Takata air bag recall or any other safety recalls. You can also visit the automakers' recall websites to determine if your vehicle is affected.

junior,"112,113,114",Female,N00030980,412493,"Ayotte, Kelly (Sen.) [R-NH]","May 23 News from Senator Ayotte's Office  Dear Friends, Last night, the Senate passed bipartisan legislation to renew Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), a tool that will help increase American trade and help New Hampshire businesses create jobs. I voted in support of this bill because I've heard directly from New Hampshire businesses -- including Mercury Systems in Hudson, which I toured last week -- about how the trade bill would help give their company fair and equal access to sell their goods and services in new markets, thereby creating more jobs in New Hampshire. The stakes are high - the current transatlantic and transpacific trade negotiations can spur international investment in New Hampshire and create an estimated 8,260 new Granite State jobs. That's a 35 percent increase in export jobs, which typically pay 13 to 18 percent more than non-export jobs. I discussed the importance of this legislation on the Senate floor this week, and you can watch my speech by clicking here. TPA now goes to the House of Representatives for consideration. This week, I worked with my colleagues to secure a commitment from Senate and House leadership that both chambers of Congress would take up and vote on bipartisan legislation to renew the Export-Import Bank. The bank, whose charter is set to expire on June 30, allows companies to obtain competitive financing to compete in the global marketplace and has helped support 36 New Hampshire businesses over the last seven years. I am cosponsoring bipartisan legislation that would reauthorize the Bank's charter until September 30, 2019, increase small business lending, support American jobs and minimize risk to taxpayers by enhancing bank oversight. Over the past two decades, the Bank has generated nearly $7 billion more than the cost of its operations. The Export-Import Bank helps small and medium sized businesses in New Hampshire compete in the global marketplace and create jobs, and failure to renew the bank's charter would cause job losses and hurt our economy. Doug Folsom, plant leader at GE Aviation's facility in Hooksett, said, ""We appreciate Sen. Ayotte's leadership in securing a path for a timely vote in the Senate on the Ex-Im Bank. Her commitment to US manufacturers is critical to the 720 jobs at this facility and the thousands of other workers who rely on exports in this state."" I'm supporting the reauthorization of the Ex-Im bank because loans obtained by businesses through the bank have a lower default rate than commercial loans, the bank returns billions of dollars to the Treasury and because it creates American jobs. I'll continue to push Congress to reauthorize Ex-Im so that New Hampshire exporters continue to have access to financing that helps them sell their goods and services overseas and create more jobs. Last night, the Senate voted on two proposals that would have reauthorized our nation's counterterrorism programs. I voted in support of a two-month extension of current law in order to allow Congress more time to consider how best to reform these programs while ensuring that our nation's intelligence personnel continue to have the necessary capabilities to prevent terrorist attacks and protect the lives of Americans. The bulk phone metadata collection program collects phone records - including phone numbers, time, and duration of calls, but not content - that telecom companies have been collecting for years.

But as you celebrate the unofficial start of summer, I encourage you to take a moment and reflect on the real meaning of this holiday. On Memorial Day, we remember those brave service members who gave what Lincoln called the last, full measure of devotion defending our country. John 15:13 says, Greater love hath no man than this, that a man lay down his life for his friends. Every American who died in our uniform laid down their life for us, their fellow countrymen, so that we might live in freedom. So todayand everyday let us all honor the memory of our valiant countrymen and celebrate our great country.

Best regards,  Tom Cotton Flags-In  As a solider in the Army I served with The Old Guard at Arlington National Cemetery. For those of you who dont know, The Old Guard at Arlington National Cemetery is primarily responsible for military honors funerals. But each Memorial Day weekend they are also responsible for placing a flag at every grave. Called Flags-In, this event has become a storied tradition since it first occurred in 1948. I had the solemn honor of participating in Flags-In twice, in 2007 and 2008. I wanted to share this moving tradition with you and encourage you to take a moment and look at some photos of Flags-In  . You can also watch a time-lapse video here  . Stopping EPA Overreach The EPAs proposed greenhouse gas rules would have a direct and devastating impact in Arkansas and across the country. In fact, under these new standards Arkansas would incur larger cuts than 44 other states. Arkansas has five coal power plants, including some of the newest and most modern facilities in the country. These coal plants provide more than half of our states electricity. Our utilities are spending hundreds of millions of dollars to make these plants some of cleanest coal plants in the world, but these EPA mandates drive up the costs even further. Thats why I recently helped introduce the Affordable Reliable Energy Now Act (ARENA), bipartisan legislation to ensure reliable and affordable energy, curb federal overreach and make job protection, creation and economy a priority. This bill pushes back against the EPAs new standards and it provides states with the flexibility to opt out of these standards if their rates are projected to increase under them. It also rightly requires the EPA to recognize the important differences between our many energy sources, ensuring Arkansass lignite coal and our coal-fired power plants arent unfairly penalized. I will continue to work with my colleagues to fight back against President Obamas EPA and to ensure Arkansans continue to have access to affordable, low-cost energy sources. Around Arkansas  Next week I will be touring businesses and attending events across Arkansas. I am looking forward to kicking things off in Russellville on Monday at their Memorial Day festivities. Be sure and check my Twitter  feed and Facebook  account throughout the week to see what Ive been up toand you may just see some pictures of Gabriels first visit out to see Grandma Avis and Grandpa Len on the farm! He may only be a few weeks old, but you can bet Grandpa Len is already ready to assign him some chores. Protecting Arkansas Exports Last week, the World Trade Organization ruled against Country of Origin Labeling regulations. This ruling once again validates the concerns of agricultural producers across Arkansas about these regulations. Unless these regulations are reversed, Arkansas exports will soon face a 100 percent retaliatory tariff that will directly impact profit margins and devastate our state economy. President Obama should change course and support the efforts underway in Congress to repeal these misguided regulations immediately. Rest assured, I am working with my colleagues in Congress as well as with partners at the Canadian and Mexican embassies to modify COOL regulations and protect Arkansans from losing access to these important markets. Arkansans in the Capitol Its always great to see Arkansans when I am in Washington for votes.

God bless all of our troops and veterans for their willingness to give their lives in defense of our freedoms and way of life. Memorial Day is also the unofficial start of summer. As you reflect and spend time with family during this holiday weekend, I hope this update provides you an informative overview of my recent work to represent you in Congress. Bipartisan Trade Bill Moving Through Congress    Trade is tremendously beneficial to Kentucky. Thousands of Kentucky jobs are supported by exporting our signature products like bourbon, coal, and cars - and civil aircraft components, which is currently the state's leading export category. If fact, a new report confirms that Kentucky exports are up 11 percent in the last quarter, helping to fuel our state economy and creating jobs here at home. In order to support jobs in these signature industries and grow our state economy, we must continue to expand into new markets. Please click here to read my op-ed in the Lexington Herald-Leader on the need to update and renew Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) and opportunities to sell Kentucky-made products abroad  . There have been many questions, theories, and misinformation about TPA, so I want to help set the record straight. The President already has authority under the Constitution to negotiate trade agreements with other nations. TPA allows Congress to direct the objectives of trade negotiations at the outset, and approve or disapprove of a final agreement through an up-or-down vote. It includes an unprecedented level of consultation and transparency requirements so that Congress and the American people can hold trade negotiators accountable. Importantly, it would require the President to publicly disclose any trade deal for 60 days before Congress votes to approve it or reject it- this would not be required without TPA. Click here to get the facts on TPA, see answers to frequently asked questions, and read the bill text  . Visiting with Kentuckians   Last week, I had the privilege of speaking with agriculture students at Harrison County High School.  Colonel Tom Hart of Irvine visited my Washington office.  I caught up with warriors for the Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis (ALS) Association of Kentucky in Washington.  I spoke to Kentuckians for Better Transportation on the need for a long-term solution for highway funding. Protecting Credit from Medical Debt Too many Americans face costly and unexpected medical bills. They should not have to endure the additional burden of years of bad credit due to an illness, injury, or even an inaccurate medical billing. That is why I joined Congressman John Carney (D-DE) to introduce the Medical Debt Relief Act. This bill would require credit reporting agencies to remove medical debt from a credit report within 45 days of the debt being either settled or paid in full. Currently, consumers may have to wait for up to seven years for paid medical debt to be removed from their credit report. Click here to learn more about this bill  .

[R-GA1]","Monday, May 18, 2015: This past Saturday I had the honor of delivering the commencement address for the graduating class of Frederica Academy on St. Simons Island. This was my first commencement address since being elected to Congress and it was truly a delight to share a few words with such a fine group of young people. It was especially good to catch up with Mike Temple, who currently serves as principal of the high school at Frederica and who coached all three of my sons in baseball at a high school in Savannah. After arriving back in Washington last night, I have a few hours of rare free time this morning and put it to good use by catching up on some much needed reading. Shortly before lunch we are back at it again and begin by taping a welcome message for the National Council of Higher Education Resources (NCHER) who will be having their spring convention in Savannah this week while I am in Washington. Next, I meet with Georgia Womens Action for New Directions (WAND), an organization that advances womens civic engagement for the health of our communities. Today, Georgia WAND is advocating on issues related to water, both surface and groundwater, regarding radiological contamination. After meeting with staff from the Congressional Research Service to learn more about the services they have to offer, we have our weekly staff meeting to review issues from last week and discuss issues that will be coming up this week. Afterwards, we have our weekly Whip Team meeting before heading to the House chamber for votes. Upon arriving, I am asked by the House staff to preside over the votes tonight and, of course, am glad to help out. When presiding over the House, the member presiding is not allowed at any time to leave the Speakers platform, a rule that I learn quickly as I attempt to retrieve my notebook that I left on the floor and am stopped by the House staff. Tuesday, May 19, 2015: My morning starts early with a meet and greet with Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker, who is considering a presidential bid in 2016. Governor Walker is an impressive leader who has done an outstanding job as Governor of Wisconsin and certainly will make a fine candidate for President if he decides to run. After our weekly Republican Conference meeting where we discuss the upcoming votes this week, I head back to the office to meet with the Georgia Construction Aggregate Association where we discuss transportation funding. Afterwards I head to a subcommittee meeting for the Committee on Education and the Workforce where we are discussing waste, fraud and abuse in the federal child nutrition programs before going to a Committee on Oversight and Government Reform meeting to vote on legislation being presented. When I return to my office, I meet with the Georgia chapter of the March of Dimes and then with the Girl Scouts of America National CEO Ana Maria Chavez. Although their national offices are in New York City, the Girl Scouts still consider Savannah home and are continuously complimenting their birthplace city. Afterwards, I head to the House chamber for our first votes of the day then back to my office to meet with representatives from the Georgia Society of CPAs, including Darrell and Debbie Thaw from Saint Simons Island. After a meeting with Rep. Kevin Brady (R-TX) to discuss health care issues currently before the Ways and Means Committee, I head back to the House chamber where I preside over the Chamber during afternoon debates, followed by our final vote series of the day. Once back in my office I host our monthly Tele Town Hall meeting where we discuss prevailing issues and answer constituent questions. Wednesday, May 20, 2015: Today is a special day as the Air Force Chief of Staff, General Mark Welsh, has invited freshman congressmen to join him for breakfast at Joint Base Myer-Henderson Hall. Gen. Welsh served a tour at Moody Air Force Base in Valdosta and speaks highly of his experiences during that time. Once we are back at the Capitol, I head over to the House Chamber where I am serving as Speaker Pro tem today and preside over morning orders. Next, I head over to the Committee on Homeland Security where we are marking up bills today, including H.R. 1615, a bill I am sponsoring addressing the backlog of Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests within the Department of Homeland Security. After a meeting with representatives from the American College of Radiology followed by a meeting with Insurance agents from the district, I head to the House Chamber for our first series of votes today. Once back in my office I host a conference call with state and local elected officials in the district to bring them up to date on the Highway Trust Fund bill that we passed yesterday. After meeting with representatives from CSX railroad and officials from Valdosta and Lowndes County, I head to the House chamber for our last series of votes. As I am walking over to the House chamber, I run into Rep. John Lewis (D-GA) who I have met on several occasions but have not had a chance to spend time with. As we walk over to the Chamber together, he shares with me stories of his past, including how his father bought 1,000 acres of land in Alabama in 1944 for $300 and his family still lives on the property today. It was a very special time for me to be able to spend time with this American treasure. Thursday, May 21, 2015: My day begins with a Republican Conference meeting with Ways and Means Chairman Paul Ryan (R-WI) to discuss the Trade Promotion and Accountability Act (TPA) followed by a meeting with representatives from the Insurance Underwriters regarding the proposed Fiduciary Rule. Next, I head over to the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform for a hearing with Post Office directors who are proposing replacing Postal Service vehicles before heading back to my office to meet with Homecare providers from the district to discuss Medicare policies. Afterwards, I head to the House Chamber for our first and only votes of the day before heading to the airport to return to the district. Once home, I head to downtown Savannah to greet members of the Atlanta Regional Commission who are in town to tour the Georgia Ports. Friday, May 22, 2015: The best thing about being home on Friday mornings is to be able to attend my Band of Brothers Bible Study. Led by Rev. Kenny Grant, our group of 150-175 men meets on Friday mornings at Garden City Baptist Church from 6:30AM to 7:30AM. This group of men and the time I get to spend with them is one of the true blessings in my life. Immediately following our meeting this morning I head down to Brunswick to participate in a Memorial Service at the Federal Law Enforcement Training Center (FLETC) honoring our federal law enforcement officers killed in the line of duty. After this wonderful tribute, my staff and I spend the afternoon touring FLETC, learning more about this interagency law enforcement training center that provides training for 91 U.S. government federal law enforcement agencies.

Passed shortly after the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Patriot Act, specifically Section 215, granted federal agencies, including the National Security Agency, increased surveillance powers to prevent additional terrorist attacks. Some Americans have concerns that the Act does not sufficiently protect our privacy, while others argue that surveillance is necessary in order for the government to effectively investigate terrorist threats. Legislation introduced in both the House and the Senate, entitled the USA Freedom Act [link 1], would reauthorize Section 215 until December 31st, 2020, with one key reform: the bill would prohibit the indiscriminate bulk collection of metadata from domestic phone companies, while maintaining the ability to conduct surveillance beyond our borders.

Let us never forget those who paid the ultimate sacrifice so that we may remain the land of the free. Selfless service, loyalty, integrity - our soldiers embody these words. May we honor our fallen service members by carrying out these truths and preserve their legacies by continuing the fight for liberty and justice for all Americans. Please join me in remembering these men and women. Thank you to our nation's veterans, those currently serving, and the families who give their unwavering support.  In case you missed it... On May 15th, the House passed the National Defense Authorization Act.  I applaud the House for standing with our nation's military by passing the NDAA.  I am pleased that the NDAA included the two bipartisan amendments I introduced, which focused on protecting our military depots, including the Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex, and adding small business protections for pharmacies associated with TRICARE. Now, I urge the Senate to act on this important legislation to give our defense leaders some certainty going into next year. I am proud to represent Robins and Moody Air Force Bases in Congress, and I will continue to push for new missions for our bases. Before the vote, I took to the floor to urge Members in the House to pass the NDAA. Watch the video below or by clicking here  .   Need a reminder of what the NDAA does specifically for our District? Moody Air Force Base: The NDAA prohibits the A-10 retirement and preserves the fleet by including $442 million for Operations and Maintenance as well as man power. Also included is $240 million for additional wing replacement for the A-10s, the construction of which takes place in Macon, GA. Moody Air Force Base will also receive $10.9 million for Military Construction, specifically for pump house and fill stand replacement. Robins Air Force Base: I voted in favor of several amendments to protect defense civilian workers including those who work at the Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex at Robins Air Force Base. The NDAA includes funding for the current E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) fleet, which are flown out of Robins, and $44.3 million for the NextGen JSTARS Recapitalization. Want to know more about my amendments? I offered two bipartisan amendments, both of which were adopted and included in the final passage of the NDAA. My first amendment helps to protect our military depots, including Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex, by clarifying that no change to the process for making commercial item determinations conflicts with the requirements in current law, thereby ensuring sufficient workload is directed to military depots. My second amendment adds small business protections for pharmacies under a pilot program for the TRICARE pharmacy benefit program. What else is good about the NDAA? The legislation authorizes the Secretary of Defense to provide $715 million in FY16 in assistance to the military and other security forces to fight against ISIS. The NDAA also prohibits furloughs at depots, rejects a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) for FY2016, and rejects cuts to commissaries. To read more about the FY2016 NDAA, please click here  .

,114,Male,N00036403,43721,"Newhouse, Dan (Rep.) [R-WA4]","News from Congressman Dan Newhouse  Dear Friends, Last week, I recognized the distinguished service of World War II American Fighter Ace Colonel Arthur Jeffrey of Yakima  on the House floor. Col. Jeffrey passed away in Yakima this April. Congress honored the memory of this remarkable American for his outstanding service defending our nation by presenting a Congressional Gold Medal, the highest civilian honor bestowed by Congress.  Colonel Arthur Jeffrey of Yakima shot down 14 enemy aircraft in the European theater during World War II Tomorrow is Memorial Day. Please take a moment to reflect and read my column honoring the sacrifice of the men and women of our Armed Forces. The High Price of Freedom: Remembering the Fallen on Memorial Day On May 25th, our nation observes Memorial Day. While many may take the opportunity of a long weekend to barbeque, enjoy time in the company of friends and celebrate the arrival of summer, I hope Americans remember the true meaning of this day. This Memorial Day let us reflect on the high price paid for our freedom and honor the fallen. We honor all of those who have died in service of our nation. From the earliest battles - in the struggle for our nations independence to the conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan today - the soldier has paid the highest price fighting for our freedom. On this day, our nation comes together to remember why the men and women of our Armed Forces willingly gave their lives. Memorial Day provides Americans the chance to ponder the brave men and women who gave up their own future for others because they deemed the freedom of their loved ones and the republic they served as worthy of sacrifice. We remember the undaunted courage of those who served, such as Army Staff Sergeant Jack James Pendleton of Yakima. In Bardenberg, Germany on 12 October 1944, SSgt. Pendletons company was pinned down by enemy machine gun fire. With virtually no cover, SSgt. Pendleton volunteered to advance to dislodge the enemy position. Without regard to his own safety, SSgt. Pendleton continued ahead of his squad to face the enemy. Despite being seriously wounded in the leg by gunfire, SSgt. Pendleton continued to crawl within 10 yards of the enemy machine gun, where he was killed by a hail of enemy fire. His selfless actions drew the enemys fire toward him, diverting attention and allowing another squad to advance and succeed in taking out the machine gun position. SSgt. Pendleton received the Medal of Honor posthumously for conspicuous gallantry and intrepidity at the risk of his life above and beyond the call of duty.  Army Staff Sergeant Jack James Pendleton Such sacrifice can leave us at a loss for words. In 1982, while giving Memorial Day remarks at Arlington National Cemetery, President Ronald Reagan expressed the inadequacy of words to match the bravery of soldiers like SSgt. Pendleton: I have no illusions about what little I can add now to the silent testimony of those who gave their lives willingly for their country. Words are even more feeble on this Memorial Day, for the sight before us is that of a strong and good nation that stands in silence and remembers those who were loved and who, in return, loved their countrymen enough to die for them. Yet, we must try to honor themnot for their sakes alone, but for our own. And if words cannot repay the debt we owe these men, surely with our actions we must strive to keep faith with them and with the vision that led them to battle and to final sacrifice. Words indeed fall shortthe flags flown at half-staff and wreaths and flowers adorning headstones of the fallen demonstrate that we, as a people, remember. As Americans, we must honor the memory of the brave and the fallen, not just on Memorial Day, but every day.

[R-GA3]","Congressman Lynn Westmoreland - 3rd District of Georgia Westmoreland Demands Benghazi Documents from State Department Thursday, I took to the House Floor to express my frustration with the lack of compliance by the State Department in regards to the House Select Committee on Benghazis investigation. I called attention to the State Departments stalling, as well as their failure to notify the committee of Secretary Clintons use of a private server that hindered the production of emails. During my Special Order, I gave a timeline of the committees work, crediting the slow pace of the committee to the lack of compliance by the State Department: Weve been asking simple questions. Weve been given no answers. Here are some additional questions for the Department. Why are they refusing to produce these emails? What are they hiding? What is so damaging that they dont want Congress or the American public to see. In order to move forward with the investigation, including questioning Secretary Clinton, the Select Committee needs all the information first. Unfortunately, the Select Committee has been forced to subpoena the State Department multiple times to get simple answers. I emphasized during the Special Order that all the questions were of equal priority and it was the legal responsibility of the State Department to fulfill the subpoenas issued. The Select Committee is tasked with providing the American people with a definitive report of what happened in Benghazi, and the committee remains committed to finding the whole truth, but the State Departments questionable and untrustworthy tactics are making it difficult for the committee to do so. **** In Other News Capitol Corner: Getting Our Veterans Back to Work During Military Appreciation Month this May, we continue to thank our veterans and active servicemen and women for their dedication to our protecting our nation...

While America was founded on great ideals, the fact was that, throughout history, virtually every experiment in republican government had failed. It was up to the founding generation to prove once and for all that a government based on reflection and choice and constrained by law and constitution, could succeed. Grounding the experiment in constitutional government in great ideas was necessary but not sufficient to ensure success. They needed individual Americans to be willing to risk their lives so that the experiment could endure. Without the sacrifices of uniformed service members, the American experiment would have ended in a whimper. This Memorial Day, I ask you to remember and thank those servicemen and women who gave the last full measure of devotion for our great nation. Their sacrifice will never be forgotten. God Bless our fallen heroes.  Some members of Congress have somehow complained that its tough making $174,000 a year. Please. We have millions of American families struggling to make ends meet. The last thing they want to hear is members of the political class complaining about how ""tough"" they have it. Our nation is facing serious problems and a pay increase for Congress is a terrible idea. My first bill to pass the House early in my freshman term blocked a pay increase for members of Congress and this week the House passed an appropriations bill for the legislative branch that continues this freeze. Since coming to Congress, I have worked to reform Washington by introducing a term limits proposal  , legislation to end congressional pensions  , as well as a bill to put an end to special ObamaCare subsidies  for Congress. The Founding Fathers envisioned elected officials as part of a servant class, yet Washington, DC has evolved into a ruling class culture who is hesitate to cut their own benefits before asking the American people to sacrifice. Please stay tuned to future newsletters for updates on these important bills - I will continue to work towards restoring accountability in Washington. For more frequent updates on legislation and events, please follow me on Facebook  and Twitter  . I look forward to hearing from you; please do not hesitate to contact my Washington, Port Orange, or St. Augustine office should you need any assistance.

Whether it's finding a job or putting a roof over their heads, the challenges facing American servicemen and women don't end when they return from the battlefield. Unemployment among post-9/11 veterans is higher than the national average and 11 percent of homeless adults previously served in the military. That's why I supported these six bills  last week. Taken together, these bills help address problems of homelessness and unemployment by expanding options for affordable housing and incentivizing employers to hire more veterans. They also take small but meaningful steps to ensure VA officials are held accountable for the care they provide. Also this weekend, I'll be speaking at the Memorial Day ceremony in Danville at 11 a.m. In my remarks, I plan to talk about what it means to be a veteran and the importance of the military code of conduct. You can find a list my office helped compile of other Memorial Day events around our district HERE  . Last week I sent this list out to folks subscribed to my veterans newsletter, which you too can sign up for HERE  . Finally this week, I want to share some exciting news from the Energy and Commerce Committee. Last week the committee unanimously approved major legislation to accelerate the discovery, development and delivery of new cures and treatments.  Congressman Shimkus with Max, a 6 year old patient with a rare disease, after voting for the 21st Century Cures Act. The 21st Century Cures Act is the product of months of hearings and roundtable discussions -- like the one Congressman Davis and I co-hosted  in Springfield last year -- with patients, disease advocates, medical professionals and industry experts. By authorizing additional funding for NIH and making FDA's review process for new drugs and devices more efficient, informed and transparent, this landmark legislation will help maintain American leadership in medical technology and innovation. You can learn more about this life-saving legislation HERE  . Thanks for reading and have a great holiday weekend.

Knowing of your interest in veterans issues, I would like to update you on the progress we are making in Congress and my efforts to address the critical needs of our veterans. I am not a veteran, so I view my role on the House Veterans Affairs Committee (HVAC) as my unique opportunity to serve those who have put their lives on the line for our great nation. I am especially proud to say that the first bill I introduced in Congress is a piece of commonsense legislation to bring greater accountability to the VA. H.R. 1038, the Ensuring VA Employee Accountability Act  , would require specific disciplinary actions to remain in an employees record while employed at the VAcurrent policy allows for certain records to be deleted after two or three years. I believe it is critical to maintain a complete record of a poor performer in order to better understand an employee as long as they are with the Department. I am pleased to report that on May 18th, this bill unanimously passed the full House of Representatives  . * I testified in support of my bill at an HVAC Economic Opportunity subcommittee hearing, and you can view it here  . * I also spoke in support  of my bill during its consideration on the House floor. You can also find my op-ed regarding my first 100 days in Congress: Serving those Who Served  . Philadelphia Regional Office  Moving Forward * On April 3rd, Congressman Meehan and I visited the Philadelphia Regional Office (PRO) where we met with whistleblowers, as well as senior VA staff. During this visit, I heard firsthand from whistleblowers and reassured them they would be provided protection. * On April 15th, the Office of the Inspector General at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA OIG) released the long-awaited report  to VA Secretary McDonald regarding the VAs strict observation of a CACREP policy in the hiring of Licensed Professional Mental Health Counselors that prevents the VA from hiring other highly qualified candidates when the VA is faced with a shortage of providers of specialty care. * On May 13th, I wrote an op-ed  regarding the urgent need for the VA to properly provide gender-specific care for our female veterans. As we move forward in the 114th Congress, you can trust that I will work to ensure that the government maintains the promises made to our servicemembers and veterans. Please do not hesitate to contact my team in Washington, DC at (202) 225-4315 or visit   to share your thoughts on legislation or issues of importance to you. Finally, if you or a family member has a concern or question with regard to VA benefits or treatment, please call my Wyomissing Office at (610) 376-7630 where one of my team members will be able to assist you. Best wishes,  Ryan Costello Member of Congress   Honored to have been presented the U.S. Army seal by Col. Hamilton, U.S. Army.  I met with PA members of the Disabled American Veterans organization who shared their legislative priorities with me when they visited Washington.  I provided a legislative update at a veterans town hall meeting hosted by the Coatesville VA Medical Center at the Southeastern Veterans Center in Spring City.  My Veterans Affairs Legislative Assistant Katharine from Washington, D.C. traveled the District to meet with veterans groups at the Lebanon VA Medical Center, the Berks County VA location in Reading, the Southeastern Pennsylvania Veterans Center facility, the Coatesville VA Medical Center, and the Pennsylvania Department of Military and Veterans Affairs.  I met with members of the Blinded Veterans Association to discuss their legislative priorities for the VA.  Washington, DC 427 Cannon H.O.B.

,114,Male,N00027462,43461,"Bilirakis, Gus (Rep.) [R-FL12]","The 21st Century Cures Act     facebook  twitter  you tube  March 24, 2015 The 21st Century Cures Act  We have a serious problem in America  too many diseases, and not enough treatments or cures. Over the past year, I have been honored to participate in the 21st Century Cures Initiative, which examines and improves the discovery-development-delivery cycle. After over a year of engaging with patients, health care providers, researchers, clinicians, and other public and private entities, the 21st Century Cures Act was born. The 21st Century Cures Act is giving us an opportunity to address some of the structural barriers to new cures and treatments. This is about the people who need more effective treatments but do not have access to them. This week, we took a huge step forward in bipartisan fashion and passed the 21st Century Cures Act in the Energy and Commerce Committee. The passage of the 21st Century Cures Act is one of the best things Congress has done in a very long time. The next stop for this bill? The House floor for a vote. However, it does not end there; this process will not be over until it is on the Presidents desk for his signature. I have a number of provisions in this bill to help get treatments and cures for the 30 million Americans living with a rare disease, curb prescription drug abuse, increase price transparency in Medicare, and more. Learn more about them by clicking here  . I also had the pleasure of meeting with Max, a young man living with a rare disease. You can find more about that meeting below. COVERing Our Veterans  The Next Step  This week, the House Veterans Affairs Committee passed my bill, the Creating Options for Veterans Expedited Recovery (COVER) Act, by unanimous consent. While it is vital that Veterans receive the care they need, it is equally important to recognize that one size does not fit all when discussing treatments for Veterans. The invisible wounds they sustained serving our country are just as serious as the physical ones. Many Veterans may thrive under traditional plans and medical care, but some may not be as responsive. We need to provide Veterans with choices, and easy access to alternative forms of therapies that work best for them. The COVER Act provides a pathway forward that will eventually allow Veterans to have a range of options for mental health treatments such as outdoor sports therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, accelerated resolution therapy, and service dog therapy. This bill is a top priority of mine, and you can watch my opening statement here.  I will continue to work to see it passed in the House of Representatives. Max   Max is a young boy fighting a rare disease. Meeting him was an honor  I know who I am fighting for here in DC. It is for people like Max  young and old  who live with a rare disease, that I am so proud to champion the OPEN Act, a key provision in the 21st Century Cures Act. There are over 7,000 rare diseases, impacting 30 million Americans nearly one in ten people. Over 95% of these diseases have no treatments, because each rare disease impacts a small number of patients. My bill, the OPEN Act, leverages the free market to incentivize drug makers to repurpose drugs to treat rare diseases. This bill can help millions of people by ensuring medications are safe and effective for rare conditions. Working For Our Veterans  I was also happy to stop by and build USO snack packs for our troops! Last week, we passed the National Defense Authorization Act, which included an increase in troop benefits and pay. This week, I am happy to help play a small part in preparing packages for our brave servicemembers.  Speaking at the Rare Disease Caucus  I was honored to speak to the Rare Disease Caucus this past week. Rare diseases are not a rare problem and they cannot be overlooked. Its rare disease cases like Max that inspire me to keep working to ensure treatments and cures are available. That is why I introduced the OPEN Act - Orphan Product Extensions Now Act. My legislation opens the door to the development of hundreds of safe and effective treatments for rare disease patients, which could potentially be reimbursed through insurance coverage. As the Energy and Commerce Committee passed the 21st Century Cures Act, which included the OPEN Act, I wont rest until the 21st Century Cures Act is on the Presidents desk, awaiting his signature. The SPACE Act >From the American West to the moon above us, Americans have always reached higher. The passage of the SPACE Act this week will help ensure commercial space ent4erprises can continue to work with NASA to innovate and push the boundaries of our world. Science matters, and this bill will help ensure that America is the leader in space and that we reap all the scientific benefits of space exploration. Memorial Day  On this Memorial Day weekend, lets please take a break from fun summertime activities like picnics and barbecues to remember those brave men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice for liberty. I recall President Ronald Reagans first Memorial Day address at Arlington National Cemetery in 1981: Today, the United States stands as a beacon of liberty and democratic strength before the community of nations. We are resolved to stand firm against those who would destroy the freedoms we cherish. We are determined to achieve an enduring peace -- a peace with liberty and with honor. This determination, this resolve, is the highest tribute we can pay to the many who have fallen in the service of our Nation. God bless the men and women who gave their lives so that we could live free. I hold them near and dear in my heart.

[R-SC7]","Congressman Tom Rice =====================  *Friends, * On the first Memorial Day (then-called Decoration Day) in 1868, 5,000 Americans gathered in Arlington National Cemetery to decorate the graves of 20,000 Union and Confederate soldiers. Today, nearly the same number of Americans gather at Arlington National to honor our fallen soldiers from every warRevolutionary to Iraq. As we gather with family and friends this Memorial Day Weekend, I want to share with you this brief video, *Honor Thy Fallen: A Memorial Day Tribute*, produced by SGT Rodney Roldan about the history of Memorial Day. I encourage you to take a moment to watch this moving tribute and share it with your loved ones.  [image = The rolling hills of Arlington National Cemetery serve as a constant reminder that *many brave Americans* sacrificed their lives for our freedom. While we can never repay their debt, we can commemorate their legacy and ensure that our children and grandchildren understand the true price of freedom. Tomorrow, at 3:00 p.m. our nation will pause to observe the National Moment of Remembrance, a moment of silence to recognize the sacrifices of our fallen troops. I also encourage you to participate in one of the many Memorial Day parades and marches across our community. I will join Seventh District Veterans and members of the Myrtle Beach Combat Veterans Motorcycle Association chapter in their Memorial Day March at 9:00 a.m. on Ocean Boulevard.

[R-IA3]","News from Iowa Congressman David Young  Home  About Me  Media Center  Services  Contact  Friends, Below is a quick rundown of what we did this week in Congress to help veterans. I also sent a letter to the Department of Homeland Security demanding accountability and introduced legislation  to shut down the president's executive amnesty's tax bonus loophole. With Memorial Day a day away, it is important to remember the tremendous sacrifice made by our veterans and their families is a gratitude we can never fully repay, but we must try. This past week in Congress I voted on six common-sense solutions - from employment opportunities to health care - to assist our American heroes. We made it easier to own a small business and offered incentives to those that hire our heroes so that veterans and their families have stability. We provided a five-year extension of a reintegration program to address veteran homelessness, and streamlined the process to receive veteran identification cards. And perhaps most importantly, we are holding the Department of Veterans Affairs accountable. At the Freedom Rock in Menlo - Adair County with the artist himself, Bubba Sorensen.   THIS WEEK IN DC I have heard reports of Border Patrol Agents who face retribution or threats for following the law. These agents are working to enforce the laws of this nation; they should not be worried about facing disciplinary action for faithfully executing their duty. (Click the picture below to view the letter and here to see my press release  .)  On Tuesday night, I held my second Telephone Townhall with people from southwest and central Iowa. We talked about Obamacare, accountability of the the EPA and the IRS, a federal gas tax, trade, the bird flu and many other important issues. Make sure to join June's call - sign-up here  .

This was an incredible moment for millions of Americans suffering from rare diseases and a huge step towards improving the way our country brings new treatments and cures to the people who need them.

Working to Ensure Veterans' Access to Care On Thursday, I joined with my colleagues from Colorado to ensure that Republican political games did not compromise the needs of Colorado veterans to access a new, state of the art hospital in Aurora. Construction at the VA hospital in Aurora has been mismanaged from the beginning. Still, we need to be working to get veterans the care they need, where they need it, and political fights that would delay construction even further make no sense. Putting veterans care in jeopardy for the sake of punishing the Department of Veterans Affairs is not acceptable. I am glad that I was able to help ensure that the VA hospital in Aurora's construction was not halted because of a political fight. While our work on Thursday only ensured temporary funding for the hospital's construction, I look forward to continuing work with my colleagues so that a permanent solution can be found. The needs of veterans are simply too important for Republicans to jeopardize so callously.

,114,Male,N00033630,43629,"Hudson, Richard (Rep.) [R-NC8]","Congressman Richard Hudson *Friends,*  *Patriotism. Its one of many feelings I get when I see an American flag. More than just stiches and dye on a piece of fabric, the American flag stands for liberty, freedom and pride. *It represents the history of our nation and soars as a symbol of our strength and unity. Along with patriotism and pride, the flag elicits an immense gratitude for our heroic men and women in uniform who display unparalleled dedication to our freedom. *Its a reminder that freedom comes with a cost, and our veterans, our soldiers and their families are paying it. *One of the most heartbreaking places to see the American flag is draped over the casket of a member of the United States Armed Forces. *There, the red, white and blue serve as an honor and a tribute to thank our veterans and those who perished while serving.*  [image = Day 2015.jpg]  *Although we are thankful each and every day for these patriots, we set aside Memorial Day to come together with family, friends and neighbors to remember their service.* Its an opportunity to reflect and offer our deepest support and gratitude to the families of those weve lost. While we remember the fallen this Memorial Day, lets recommit ourselves to caring for our active duty troops, veterans and their families. As George Washington said, *The willingness with which our young people are likely to serve in any war, no matter how justified, shall be directly proportional to how they perceive the veterans of earlier wars were treated and appreciated by their nation.*  Thats one reason why I am continuing to fight to fix the issues at the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA). Make no mistake, there are many good and dedicated people at VA medical facilities in North Carolina who work hard to provide veterans the service they deserve. The problem is the bureaucracy has gotten so massive and out of control that resources are wasted and the quality of care delivered to veterans has decreased. Last week, the House passed a handful of bills to increase accountability at the VA and support our veterans. One bill, the*Ensuring VA Employee Accountability Act*, will bring to light discrepancies and guarantee poor performance by employees at the agency are not swept under the rug. *My colleagues and I will continue our efforts to reshape the culture at the VA, but its high time this administration takes responsibility and cleans up the mess.*  As always, my office stands ready to assist every veteran in our district with problems they are having with the VA.

[R-MS]","Roger Wicker, US Senator for the State of Mississippi - E-Newsletter *Wicker Helps Secure NDAA Success as Seapower Chairman* *Defense Bill Earns Broad Support in Committee* One of my primary responsibilities as chairman of the Senate Armed Services Subcommittee on Seapower is addressing the annual needs and reforms of the Navy and Marine Corps. The subcommittee works to craft provisions for the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), offering our naval and Marine leaders a comprehensive blueprint for achieving U.S. interests and troop readiness. The overall bill outlines the entire budget for the Department of Defense and national security programs at the Department of Energy.    Even in times of extreme gridlock, NDAA has always been a prime example of bipartisan agreement and cooperation. Democrats and Republicans have worked together to pass the nations premier defense bill for the past 53 years. I am pleased that this years bill supports shipbuilding, the future vitality of our National Guard, and a modern Army air fleet.  Earlier this month, the full Armed Services Committee approved NDAA for Fiscal Year 2016 with overwhelming support. The bill is expected on the Senate floor as soon as next week, putting its vote months ahead of when the Democrat-led Senate passed the legislation last year. *Mississippis Imprint on National Defense* Our state continues to play an active role in preparing our armed forces for their missions. My oversight responsibilities on the Seapower Subcommittee and Commerce Committee recently took me to Connecticut and Rhode Island, where Mississippis contributions were on full display. My visit included tours of two submarine factories in Quonset Point, R.I., and Groton, Conn., the Naval Submarine Base at New London, Conn., and the U.S. Coast Guard Academy, also in New London. At the factories, I saw firsthand how components made by Mississippians at Seemann Composites in Gulfport are helping build the next generation of Americas submarines. At the naval base and Coast Guard Academy, I visited with Mississippians who have chosen to dedicate their talents to serving our country. Some of these future Coast Guardsmen may one day carry out their duties on national security cutters built at Huntington Ingalls Industries shipyard in Pascagoula.  *Honoring Fallen Soldiers on Memorial Day* Our states military pride extends far beyond current defense priorities. As we gather to celebrate Memorial Day, we should remember the Mississippians who have a special place in the holidays history. In 1866, a group of women put flowers on the graves of both Confederate and Union soldiers at Friendship Cemetery in Columbus. The touching gesture earned national attention, inspiring todays tributes and salutes. Americas heroes are not alone in their sacrifice. They are supported day in and day out by loved ones. On Memorial Day, we also remember the husbands, wives, children, and siblings who have lost members of their family in the line of duty.  Maintaining a strong national defense is one way to honor the Americans who have made the ultimate sacrifice as well as those who continue to serve today. The defense bill and a robust defense industrial base are important to this process, ensuring that our warfighters have the equipment they need to fulfill diverse and increasingly complex missions. We live in a volatile world with unprecedented challenges, and our defense priorities should reflect this reality. In preparing for the future, we continue the cause that millions of Americans have represented throughout history  the promise of freedom and peace throughout the world.

In Central Florida, we remember U.S. Marine Marine Sgt. Mark Johnson IV of Altamonte Springs, who died May 12th in earthquake-ravaged Nepal. Mark perished not in combat, but on a mission of aid and mercy. Greater love has no man than to lay down his life for his fellow man.

[R-CO3]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email   About Me  Media Center  Serving You  Legislation  Contact Me  Update from Congressman Scott Tipton Dear Friend, When you turn on the news, the steady stream of reports on the challenges facing our nation and the world can at times seem overwhelming. We hear of groups around the globe like Al Qaeda, ISIS and Boko Haram inflicting violence and terror, and of threats from radicals looking to disrupt peace and kill innocent Americans because of where we live and what we stand for as a free people. Despite these challenges and threats, Americans for the most part are able to live safely and securely here at home. That is because of the willingness of a special few who serve in our nations Armed Forces and stand in harms way. Since its founding, America has had to fight for its survival, and in doing so, has advanced the cause of liberty around the world. Thats the great thing about our country; its very existence has, more than any other nation in history, made the world a safer and better place to live. The actions taken by a small group of Americans in service to our nation, including those who fought in WWI, WWII, Korea, Vietnam, the Persian Gulf, Iraq and Afghanistan, have had an incredible impact on the history of the world and are the reason we are able to live freely in this incredible country and join together on Memorial Day to honor their sacrifices. One of the brave individuals whose memory we celebrate is Pfc. George Geer from my hometown of Cortez, Colorado. Pfc. Geer was one of a long line of descendants in his family, stretching all the way back to the Revolutionary War, to serve this country. He was a gunner with the 503rd Airborne Infantry, stationed in Ramadi when he was tragically killed in 2005, far from his family and the snowcapped mountains of Southwest Colorado where he loved to hunt and ski, and the fields at Dolores High School where he was a four sport athlete. Pfc. Geer could have chosen a more common path in life like most of us do, but like his ancestors before him, he put aside his safety and security and answered a special call to defend our nation. Thank God for Pfc. Geer and those like him. This Memorial Day in Cortez, the community will dedicate an open space area in honor of his memory. This area will pay tribute to the life of this American hero and serve as a reminder of the profound sacrifice Pfc. Geer and all of the men and women who have lost their lives in service to our nation have made. It will be an honor and privilege to take part in the dedication ceremony and share in this special day with Pfc. Geers family. While Memorial Day is a special day to focus on and pay tribute to the fallen, its important to keep their memory alive year round and never forget the sacrifices made by these few special Americans including Pfc. George Geer. Every day that we are able to live free and in peace here at home is a testament to their lives. Thank you to all of our veterans and to the families of those who have lost a loved one in defense of this great nation. God bless all of you and God bless the USA.

During the House Committee on Natural Resources hearing on Empowering State Management of Greater Sage Grouse, witnesses from the states of Colorado, Utah and Idaho told Tipton that not only have federal agencies not provided recovery goals, but even if they did and the states met those goals, states would still remain subject to an ESA listing should it go into effect over the 11 state range.

[R-AL1]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email  News from Representative Bradley Byrne  ABOUT BRADLEY  | HOW CAN I HELP  | NEWSROOM  | CONTACT BRADLEY  Friends, August 10th, 2009, likely started as any other day for Marine Lance Corporal Bruce Bubba Ferrell Jr.  The Baldwin County High School graduate was on a foot patrol in the Helmand province of Afghanistan when he stepped on an improvised explosive device, or IED. The explosion took his life. Army Chief Warrant Officer 2 Phillip Johnson  attended the University of South Alabama before joining the Marines. He later left the Marines and joined the Army. In January of 2004, Johnson lost his life during a Black Hawk crash in Iraq. Friends and family of Marine Corporal Joseph Joe Whitehead  from Axis in Mobile County called him tough as nails. He was tragically killed in 2011 by a roadside bomb while serving the United States in Afghanistan. Marine Corporal Christopher Winchester  was a native of Flomaton in Escambia County. His pastor in East Brewton explained that before he left for Iraq he asked the church congregation to pray for his safety. Tragically, he died in a roadside bomb explosion near Tikrit, Iraq.  These are just a few stories of American heroes from Southwest Alabama who lost their life while serving in the United States military over the last decade. Unfortunately, there are far too many stories of South Alabamians who made the ultimate sacrifice in conflicts ranging from World War I to Vietnam to the War on Terror. As we celebrate Memorial Day this weekend, I hope you take time to remember these heroes and all of those who lost their life while defending our country. I hope you reflected on what the holiday is all about. Memorial Day isnt about trips to the beach or family barbeques. Memorial Day isnt about time off work or family vacations. Memorial Day is about the men and women, throughout history, who have given their lives so that we may continue to enjoy the freedoms we hold dear.  >From time to time, I travel out to Arlington National Cemetery and visit the graves of Alabamians who are buried on the hallowed grounds. There is nothing more powerful than paying a visit to the 624 acre cemetery, which is home to over 400,000 total graves. The small white tombstones stretch on for miles and serve as a small reminder of the sacrifice our service men and women make to defend our nation. So to Corporal Winchester, Corporal Whitehead, Chief Warrant Officer Johnson, and Lance Corporal Ferrell: I say thank you. Thank you for putting your nation and our freedoms above yourself. Thank you for the sacrifice you made so that others may live. Thank you to all of those who have served, are serving, or intend to serve in the United States military. Our nation is forever grateful. U.S. Secretary of Transportation Coming to Mobile I'm excited to announce that U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx is coming to Mobile  on Tuesday to learn more about our area's transportation needs, including the I-10 bridge project. The visit comes following an invitation I made to the Secretary last year.  During the visit, Secretary Foxx will visit with the Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, attend a roundtable meeting with local mayors from Southwest Alabama, and hold a press conference at the Port of Mobile. With it being Memorial Day weekend, the visit comes as the perfect time to show just how bad the backups at the Wallace Tunnel can be. I also look forward to talking with the Secretary about finding a long-term, reliable solution for funding our nation's highway program. Last week, the House passed a short-term extension that will keep highway programs going through July, but we must get a long-term solution in place. I look forward to discussing potential solutions with Secretary Foxx. I will certainly give you an update on the visit next week, so stay posted. Red Snapper Legislation On the Move I've got some good news for our local Red Snapper fishermen. The House has started to debate  the Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act, which includes three important Red Snapper reforms that I worked to have included. Specifically, my provisions would: * Repeal inflexible quotas for the Gulf of Mexico Red Snapper fishery * Extend state water boundaries for each Gulf state to nine nautical miles * Remove data collection and stock assessments from federal control  I delivered a pretty passionate speech from the House floor  outlining why this bill is so important to those of us on the Gulf Coast. To some people in Washington, this issue doesnt mean much. But to the small restaurant employees in Gulf Shores, or to the charter boat captain in Orange Beach, or the gas station in Foley, or the condo owners in Dauphin Island, or the thousands of families who spend time fishing on the Gulf Coast and all around our country: this bill is critically important. This bill is about getting the federal government off their backs. I was disappointed to learn that President Obama has already threatened to veto this bill  because he says it ""undermines good science."" I'm a strong supporter of science-based management, but I do not support FLAWED science-based management. Don't forget: it is the federal scientists who aren't sampling for Red Snapper, which is a reef fish, on reefs. It is simply absurd. The President's veto threat won't stop me from pushing ahead with this critical legislation. The House is expected to pass the bill the week of June 1, so I'll keep you up to date. Week in Review Big Month for Austal: Last week Austal launched the USNS Brunswick  , the 6th Joint High Speed Vessel produced in Mobile. The Brunswick is the second U.S. Navy ship Austal has launched in three months. I remain so proud of all the men and women who work at the shipyard. Telephone Town Hall Meeting: Tuesday evening I held a telephone town hall meeting with over 1,000 constituents back in Southwest Alabama. We covered a number of issues ranging from immigration to veterans affairs to health care. I always enjoy using these telephone town hall meetings to keep up with my constituents when I am in Washington.  Visitors from St. Luke's: One of the best parts of my job is getting to host families and groups when they visit Washington, D.C. There is something truly special about visiting our nation's capital, and I love to show visitors around. This week, I visited with a great group from St. Luke's in Mobile! If you or your family are planning a visit to Washington, click here to let me know  . Investigating the Clinton Foundation: By now, all Americans have heard about the controversy surrounding the Clinton Foundation. That's why I joined a number of my House colleagues in sending a letter to the IRS asking them to investigate the tax-exempt status of the Clinton Foundation. No one should be able to operate above the rule of law. Learn more by clicking here  . What's Ahead Next week the House is out of session, and I will be back in the district. I look forward to attending two Memorial Day ceremonies on Monday in Satsuma and Spanish Fort. I hope each of you will find a special way to reflect on the sacrifices our military men and women have made on behalf of our great nation. On this Memorial Day weekend, I want to remind you that if you or someone you know is having trouble with the Department of Veterans Affairs, please let me know. I have a dedicated team of caseworkers who stand ready to assist our area's veterans. So please give my office a call at 251-690-2811 or click here to send me an email  .

,114,Male,N00031593,43524,"Denham, Jeff (Rep.) [R-CA10]","US Congressman Jeff Denham, Proudly Serving You in Congress Dear Friend, We had encouraging news from the Senate Appropriations Committee yesterday with the passage of their 2016 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill. The bill will fully fund the construction of the long-awaited community-based outpatient clinic in French Camp. Last month Rep. McNerney and I urged the committee to include French Camp funding in a letter [link 1] to the Sens. Mark Kirk and Jon Tester, Chairman and Ranking Member of the MilCon VA subcommittee, and this funding puts us one step closer to seeing this facility built for our vets. Central Valley residents have waited far too long and been forced to endure six-hour roundtrips back and forth to access the quality care they deserve. Im committed to working on a bipartisan basis to get this across the finish line. This week we worked through appropriations for the legislative branch on the House floor. I also voted for several bills to help our veterans, including one that enables the Secretary of the VA to give preference to government contractors who choose to employ veterans. As co-chair of the Congressional Veterans Jobs Caucus, hiring vets and encouraging others to do the same is a key mission. I also voted for the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act, or H.R. 1806, which reforms the ways we fund civilian research programs to ensure that were focused on key topics like biology, engineering and computer sciences. Our nation should be able to lead in these important sciences, and that means correctly prioritizing the research where time and money can be spent most efficiently. On Wednesday I supported H.R. 880, the American Research and Competitiveness Act, which makes the research and development tax credit permanent and makes the credit easier to calculate. This credit encourages our companies, large and small, to remain innovative. Yesterday I introduced a bill, called the NEPA Reciprocity Act [link 2], which will remove unnecessary bureaucracy in the environmental review processes of highway, rail, transit and multi-modal projects. My bill gives the Secretary of Transportation authority to certify that a states environmental review process is sufficient to satisfy the federal environmental review process established under NEPA, the National Environmental Policy Act. Under the NEPA Reciprocity Act, California projects which have already passed the states stringent environmental review process (required by the California Environmental Quality Act, CEQA) could bypass a duplicative and redundant second layer of review, dramatically streamlining the project delivery process. My legislation is supported by the National Association of Counties and the California State Association of Counties. On Tuesday, I joined a group of 75 delegates from the University of California system to discuss my efforts as co-chair of the California Public Higher Education Caucus and what we can do to make sure each of our students has a bright future ahead. When I graduated from high school, I was able to join the military, serve my country, return and begin school. After graduating from Cal Poly San Luis Obispo, I could begin paying off my student loans, find a job, start my own small business, watch that business grow, start a family and work to afford a home. These are the kinds of opportunities I worry my own kids wont have with our current economy and job market, and thats why we have to remain focused on improving the futures of all of our kids. [image = My fellow co-chair Rep. Bera also joined in the discussion.

Right here in North Texas, the Texas Department of Transportation needs support from both sides of the aisle to ensure Texas can continue work on long-term projects like the Horseshoe Project near downtown Dallas and to ensure residents can continue to utilize reliable public transit services like Dallas Area Rapid Transit, which serves thousands in the DFW Metroplex. As our nation approaches one of the busiest travel seasons of the year, this short-term patch will provide Congress with enough time to develop a long-term bill that will allow Texas and states across the nation to get to work on repairing our nations crumbling roads, bridges, and transit systems. This temporary patch is only the first step; Congress must utilize the upcoming months to put together a bipartisan, long term transportation bill that adequately funds our transportation infrastructure for years to come.

Highlights from this month include the Congressional Art Competition for high school students in the Fourth District, observing National Police Week, and supporting legislation that reflects the values of Central Washington. Sign up here to stay connected  . Confronting Federal Overreach and Standing Up for Local Oversight of the Environment Earlier this month, I voted to support passage of H.R 1732, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act of 2015, requiring the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to withdraw the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule. Drafted without input from local stakeholders, the Waters of the United States rule is an attempted power grab to impose tighter controls over waters that the Clean Water Act never intended to regulate. WOTUS could be used to expand federal regulation over ponds, streams, or irrigation ditches in the middle of crop land, giving the EPA unprecedented say over what farmers can or cant do with their land. I also introduced H.R. 2352, the State, Tribal, and Local Species Transparency and Recovery Act. This legislation would require the federal government to disclose to affected states all data used prior to any listing decisions under the Endangered Species Act. H.R. 2352 requires the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service and the National Marine Fisheries Service to provide states with the data they are using to justify their listing decisions, which increases transparency and the opportunity for community engagement. The bill also requires that the best available scientific and commercial data used by the federal government include data provided by affected states, tribes, and local governments.

,114,Male,N00027239,43418,"Lipinski, Daniel (Rep.) [D-IL3]","Congressman Daniel Lipinski  *Stop Fast-Track Trade Agreement Bill in Its Tracks* [image = track press conference.jpg] Congressman Dan Lipinski (IL-3) and Congresswoman Robin Kelly (IL-2) were joined at a Chicago manufacturing plant earlier this month by representatives from organized labor, environmental groups, and industry to denounce legislation that would grant the president Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) to fast-track trade deals through Congress. *Congressman Lipinskis Op-Ed From the May 18th Edition of the* **Chicago Tribune** [link 1] **President Obama and Republican congressional leaders are currently trying to pass a bill granting the president the authority to fast-track trade agreements through Congress. If passed, Congress would then be forced to vote up-or-down on any administration-negotiated trade deals with no amendments allowed and only limited debate. We can all agree that increasing exports and cutting our enormous trade deficit is critical to growing our economy and creating jobs, but history and commonsense tell us that fast-track is the wrong track.  Whenever a president - Democrat or Republican - negotiates a new foreign trade agreement, he promises the American people more exports and more jobs. But time after time, the result has been fewer American jobs, lower wages, and a bigger trade deficit. Since NAFTA was signed, Illinois alone has lost close to 300,000 manufacturing jobs (1). These were quality jobs with high wages and good benefits that supported hard-working middle class families. Not all these job losses were due to this flawed trade agreement, but NAFTA did hurt American manufacturing. Overall, the Economic Policy Institute estimates that NAFTA cost almost 700,000 American jobs (2). Unfortunately history keeps repeating itself, with the latest free trade agreement being no different. The Obama Administration promised that the Korea Free Trade Agreement would produce 70,000 new jobs and soaring exports, but since it was implemented in 2012 weve seen a loss of 60,000 American jobs and a 25% increase in the manufactured goods trade deficit with South Korea (3). Despite the failure of the Korea agreement, the Administration is using it as a template for a much larger agreement that is currently being negotiated, the Trans-Pacific Partnership or TPP. The TPP covers 11 U.S. trading partners that account for 40% of our trade(4). This would be the biggest trade deal in history. And TPP is the first deal that would get fast-tracked. We cannot let this endless cycle of failure to continue. When it comes to the content of the TPP, the Administration has already said that the agreement is not going to address the unfair practice of currency manipulation. Currency manipulation occurs when a country interferes in the world market to keep the value of its currency at an artificially low level against the U.S. dollar in order to make American products too expensive to sell in that country. This is major driver of our enormous trade deficit and is practiced by many TPP countries including Japan. In addition to the job losses, language in the TPP suggests that the agreement will take away our ability to enact environmental regulations to protect our communities and that the Investor-State Dispute Settlement system will preference corporations over our own sovereignty and the right to set state and local regulations. But it is difficult to know for sure what exactly the TPP will do because the Administration has shrouded the agreement in secrecy. It is very difficult even for members of Congress to see the language that is being negotiated, and when we can get access we are not allowed the help of anyone to decipher the text or to take any notes. Essentially we are being told, trust us. But that trust is very difficult and not just because of failed promises from past trade deals. Administration officials falselyclaim that we have a trade surplus with the countries we have previously signed free trade agreements with. But this relies on an accounting trick; for example, if $1 billion of Chinese goods get shipped through the U.S. to Canada then the U.S. Trade Representative counts this as an American trade surplus of $1 billion resulting from NAFTA. The real numbers from the U.S. International Trade Commissions data show a massive trade deficit with Americas free trade partners of $155 billion overall and $49 billion in manufactured goods alone (5). Another bad free trade agreement will only make our trade deficit worse and cost more American jobs. As members of Congress, our responsibility to our constituents is to closely examine and analyze the text of any trade deal being discussed and then consult with our negotiators to ensure that the agreement will create American jobs, raise wages, and safeguard the consumer and environmental protections which Americans rely upon. Fast-track takes away our ability to do this. Congress must say no. The fast-track bill has been passed in committees in both the House and the Senate, and the Senate will soon be voting on the bill, where it is expected to eventually pass. Like the rest of the country, the Chicago region shows the scars of past trade agreements, closed factories and lost jobs. Many local manufacturers expect more of the same, if not more, if fast-track is approved. Theres still time to work together to protect American workers, American manufacturers, and our environment by stopping fast-track. Americans, especially the middle class, cannot afford it.** [1]Public Citizen, Illinois Job Loss During the NAFTA-WTO Period.

Click here to open a plain text version of this email   CONTACT  SERVICES  NEWS  ISSUES  LEGISLATION      Dear Friend, As I'm sure you notice every time you drive on roads like I-5, SR 522, or any of our bridges, our nation's transportation infrastructure is at a breaking point. It's time for us to invest in our future economic growth by repairing our crumbling roads and bridges.  An accessible and efficient infrastructure is crucial to attracting businesses, creating jobs, and promoting economic growth in Washington's 1st Congressional District. Without viable transportation infrastructure, our manufactured goods and locally-grown fruits and vegetables won't be able to reach consumers across the country and throughout the world. We learned this lesson all too well when the Skagit Bridge collapsed, and our local economy was negatively affected. Yesterday, the House of Representatives passed just a two-month extension of federal highway and transit programs, punting on an issue that is vital to our local economy. I voted for this extension because, while not ideal, it is important that funding isn't cut off for our current projects, such as the 520 bridge construction. Congress needs to come up with an agreement on a long-term solution for fixing our transportation infrastructure. It's critical to our economy that House leaders do not punt on this issue again come July 31. The Highway Trust Fund currently supports nearly 6,000 construction projects and 660,000 jobs. For many of these projects, certainty and stability is essential to ensuring the taxpayers receive the best return on their investment. Moving forward, I will continue to push for long-term transportation solutions, not short-term extensions that hinder sustained growth of our economy. As always, my office is here to serve you.

Yesterday afternoon, the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (S.178), which is a sweeping bipartisan anti-human trafficking bill that includes provisions I authored. That means it is now headed to the President's desk for his signature. The section of the bill that I wrote accomplishes three things. First, it improves existing Department of Justice grants to ensure they support shelters for survivors of human trafficking. Today, there are just 200 beds available in the country for underage victims, so this is an important expansion. My language also launches a review that will look into federal and state trafficking prevention activities. I'm hopeful it will help identify and develop best practices to prevent trafficking. Finally, it requires an inventory of existing federal anti-trafficking efforts to ensure the money we're spending is working for victims. In addition to the portion that I wrote, this bill aims to stop websites that are known to facilitate the buying and selling of our children for sex. It establishes grant programs to help teach medical professionals how to identify victims of trafficking, as they are often one of the first lines of defense when it comes to identifying a trafficking victim. And it helps improve law enforcement task forces to combat this terrible crime. All in all, it amounts to one of the largest anti-trafficking packages passed in nearly a decade. This fight is not over, however. Building awareness is still a huge challenge. Many see the issue as removed from themselves, their families, and their communities. But the reality is that trafficking is occurring in our backyards - even right here in South Dakota. These words are not intended to cause unnecessary alarm, but to bring into perspective that it isn't just happening overseas or in communities far away from our own. I encourage you to click here  and learn more about how to recognize the signs of trafficking. Thank you to all of those in South Dakota who have worked so hard on this issue. This bill's passage is another step forward. All the best, Kristi P.S. Watch  me debate the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act.  Washington, D.C.

,114,Female,N00029788,43485,"Lummis, Cynthia (Rep.) [R-WY0]","Comment Period on Federal Rule Affecting Wyomings Sheep Growers Dear Friends, Wyoming is the proud home for many different agriculture families including farmers, cattle ranchers, and sheep growers. Wyomings sheep growing families have been helping feed and clothe America for generations. Though these producers continue raising sheep, very few Americans remain interested in taking jobs to shepherd the animals. So since the 1950s, to fill these shepherding jobs, many of these family businesses have by necessity been turning to foreign workers, using H2A visas for temporary guest workers. However on April 15 of this year, the Department of Labor proposed a rule to change the regulations governing H2A guest workers. The proposed federal rule changes the definition of open range, herding, and the nature of these jobs to the point where, I believe, they could no longer do the practical work needed. I think these one-size-fits-all federal mandates will draw a noose of red tape around our local family sheep growers and threaten to put them out of business. Since the effects of this rule could be so dire, I and 35 of my colleagues joined to get an extension for commenting on this rule and we will continue to fight to protect our family sheep producers. With the extension, deadline for comment on the rule is June 1, 2015. Feel free to let this administration know what you think about this rule change.

Maloney Dear Lindsey, I wanted to share with you some great news about landmark legislation to crack down on human trafficking. This week the House of Representative passed the *Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act* with overwhelming bipartisan support. I have been working on this bill for many years, and Im thrilled that it will soon be law. The Senate passed the bill unanimously in April. [image = It is a harsh reality that sexual slavery persists across America. With this legislation, Congress has taken a firm stand against the pimps and Johns and for women and children. *The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act will:* - Provide resources to survivors of human trafficking and child pornography with a new Domestic Trafficking Victims Fund and make victims eligible for job training, housing assistance and other restorative resources. - Create additional tools and resources for law enforcement to combat human trafficking and child pornography and relocate missing children. - Target demand for human trafficking with stiffer penalties and by encouraging police, prosecutors, judges, and juries to target all persons involved in the buying and selling of human trafficking victims. - Protects child victims from being prosecuted for prostitution and helps victims expunge their record of crimes that they committed as a direct result of being enslaved. It has been a privilege to work with Congressman Ted Poe, a Republican from Texas, who as a judge learned first-hand of the destructive nature of these crimes. He has been an unyielding advocate in his work to help the survivors rebuild their lives. Click here to watch my speech on the House Floor about this landmark legislation.

Many farmers and landowners were preparing for the EPA to mandate that they fence in ponds and ditches on their properties because of the agencys pending Waters of the United States rule. The EPA announced the proposed rule last year. Its a plan to radically redefine the scope of the waters the federal government can regulate. Prior to the proposal, the term Waters of the United States traditionally governed navigable waters, such as those navigated by boats or ships. Under the EPAs proposed new definition, many other waters that flow or accumulate anywhere in the United States  such as drainage ditches, farm ponds, and even seasonally wet areas  could be subject to regulation. This would mean that if a heavy rain deposited a stream of water on ones property, under certain circumstances, the federal government could regulate it. This revision represents a massive overreach by the federal government as it attempts to seep into the private property of American families. As Ive traveled throughout my district, Ive met farmers, ranchers, developers, local government officials, and average homeowners who have all expressed their deep concerns about this overreach. This proposal could impact property owners by forcing them to get permits to use water on their own lands. Im proud to have voted for H.R. 1732, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act, which gives the EPA 30 days to withdraw its proposed rule and write a new rule after gaining consensus from the public, state and local officials, and other stakeholders about which waters and wetlands should be covered. This bipartisan bill reins in part of the rampant regulatory machine that Washington has become. It passed the House 261-155.

In putting this legislation together, my goal was to hold the line on spending and put forth a conservative bill that honors and respects taxpayers. I'm proud to say we did just that! My bill, which passed the House yesterday, freezes spending as well as member pay. Click HERE to watch my remarks on the House floor. In writing the bill, I made tough decisions and stretched every dollar just like families across America do every day. In addition to freezing House spending and member pay, we require new oversight rules for major construction projects and completely eliminate an outdated, multi-million dollar per year program called Open World Leadership Center.

,114,Male,N00007727,43273,"Blumenauer, Earl (Rep.) [D-OR3]","Dear Friends, Throughout my career in public service, I have fought for smarter investment in our bridges, roads, bike paths, and other parts of our transportation system. These networks form the lifeblood of our communities  especially in Portland. Investment in new projects like the Tilikum Crossing  set to open in a little over 100 days  as well as basic maintenance of our roads, are essential to making Portland safer, livable, walkable, bikeable and accessible by transit. But whether its making it safer to bike on Powell or building much-needed sidewalks and crosswalks in East Portland, there is more to be done to improve the livability of neighborhoods throughout Portland. Additionally, investing in safer streets will create family wage jobs now. However, the federal partnership that states and local communities like Portland rely on to make these improvements and plan for the future is uncertain. For over a decade, the Federal Surface Transportation Program has limped along, providing only months of funding at time, making long-term project planning and even basic maintenance difficult. For 20 years, a big reason for this is that the funding mechanism for our highways and transit program, the federal gas tax, is broken. Congress has had to borrow tens of billions from the general Treasury fund since 2008 to make up for gas tax revenue lost to inflation and rising fuel efficiency. This year, I introduced legislation to fix this problem and move the nation toward finding a new, fairer and more sustainable funding source. We must do more than maintain the status quo. We need to plan for the Portland region of the future and not be satisfied with the ""dream of the 90s."" I will continue to fight in Congress to give the people of Oregon and Portland what they deserve  a long-term solution to funding transportation projects to ensure our communities are safer and more efficient.

senior,"112,113,114",Male,N00001758,300048,"Grassley, Charles “Chuck” (Sen.) [R-IA]","News and Alerts from Senator Grassley I recently sent you a news story about a letter I sent to IBMasking about its policies regarding H-1B visas, a specialized visa allowing foreign workers with high-skilled jobs to work in the United States. Recent lay-offs coincided with the companys application for thousands of these high-skill visas. I wanted to be sure IBM wasnt laying off Iowans only to replace them with foreign workers. I appreciate the company being in Iowa and the jobs it has created, but the recent lay-offs are concerning to me. Heres a new story about whats happening in Dubuque and Columbia, MO. Iowa Spent $50 Million to Lure IBM. Then the Firings Started May 19, 2015 00:00AM ET | Bloomberg Government (Bloomberg) -- Five years after bringing high-tech jobs to the Midwestern states of Iowa and Missouri, International Business Machines Corp. has fired half its workers there -- sowing ire and disappointment for locals and officials alike. In April, Iowa Senator Chuck Grassley wrote IBM to condemn the firing of about 700 employees in Dubuque, Iowa. The same month, Missouri suspended tax credits after IBMs headcount in the city of Columbia fell below the required minimum of 500. When IBM came to Dubuque in 2009 and then to Columbia, it needed workers to help companies run their technology. Three years later a new CEO decided to automate some of the business, and the firings began. Its a blow to Dubuque and Columbia, cities that spent a combined $84 million on tax breaks and other incentives to lure Big Blue in the hopes of attracting other technology firms and incubating a startup scene. Its a story that has played out often across America: Big company comes to town, provides boost to the local economy and then leaves. In the 20th Century this narrative took decades to unfold, as companies making things like steel and furniture gradually found themselves unable to compete. Now, the process can happen in a matter of years, especially if the employer is a tech company battling disruptive upstarts or rebooting strategy on the fly. IBM declined to comment on the employment levels in Dubuque and Columbia, future plans for the locations or on the treatment of its workers there. IBM is constantly investing in skills to meet the demands of our clients, especially in areas such as Cloud, Analytics, Mobile, Social and Security, Adam Pratt, a spokesman for IBM, wrote in an e-mailed statement. Rick Dickinson, a Dubuque official who helps lure new employers, said hed expected IBM to put the city on the map and help Iowa transcend Midwestern stereotypes he describes as: red barn, silo, Holstein cow, hog and a bale of hay. No company before IBM has moved into town or ramped up so quickly - - only to scale back, he said. Vulnerable to Changes In 2012, Ginni Rometty became IBMs chief executive officer. She inherited a company that had largely missed the transition to cloud computing, which allows IBMs corporate customers to fix problems online rather than deal with human beings -- like the workers in Dubuque. Last year, with the services business struggling and demand tumbling for IBMs hardware, Rometty axed 16,600 positions from the 431,200-strong workforce, and offloaded 35,000 more positions through divestitures. Many of the remaining workers in Dubuque said they think IBM plans to pull out altogether. IBM declined to comment on how long the company plans to stay. IBM isnt alone. In rural Kansas and Nevada, Inc. is shuttering two warehouses as it focuses on same-day delivery and shifts operations closer to big cities. Near Phoenix, Arizona, Apple Inc. is converting a factory into a data center, ditching plans to manufacture iPhone screens there because the company couldnt guarantee their quality; the new operation probably will employ fewer people. Going after big names makes you vulnerable to the vagaries of the companys fortune, said Howard Cure, director of municipal research at Evercore Wealth Management LLC in New York. Even if youre getting multiple companies tied to the same industry, youre vulnerable on the changes in that industry. Ongoing Renaissance Six years ago, landing IBM seemed like a no-brainer for Dubuque. America was in the throes of the financial crisis and the city had never really recovered from the collapse of local farms. The worlds largest technology services company was proposing to hire 1,300 locally for a new global delivery center. IBMs Dubuque operation opened on Aug. 25, 2009, with a ribbon-cutting ceremony attended by local and state officials. The city and state had lavished more than $50 million in incentives on IBM, including a rehabilitation of the historic Roshek Building just off Main Street. Dubuque sent the company hundreds of resumes from potential recruits. IBM agreed to pay its Dubuque workers an average annual salary of about $46,000 -- about double the local average income per capita, according to the U.S. Census Bureau. In a press release, the company called its Midwestern outpost a milestone in the ongoing renaissance of Dubuque and looked forward to an enduring relationship. Chris Ross was one of the first people hired. She and other incoming employees anticipated learning high-tech skills on which to build a long-term career. In a January 2009 release about new jobs in Dubuque, IBM touted its commitment to work with local higher-education institutes for recruitment and training of potential employees. Instead, Ross found herself toiling on what she described as a new-age assembly line -- each employee solving a narrowly focused part of a corporate customers technical problem and then passing the baton to the next person. As a result, said some of IBMs Dubuque workers, they became experts only in a narrow set of skills that werent easily transferable. We came to IBM thinking we would work hard, show how qualified we were, and get raises and promotions, said Ross, who quit before the firings began. Resource Action Dave King was fired -- IBM calls it resource action -- from the Dubuque services center about a year ago. The 62-year-old father of three is now driving a school bus 20 hours a week. He failed to find another technical job. Grassley, a Republican, wrote to Rometty on April 16 to express concern about reports of mass layoffs even as IBM requested H-1B work visas to allow 5,800 foreign employees to be authorized to work for the company in the U.S., he explained in an interview. What are you doing to make sure you make a good faith effort to hire Americans? he said. IBM declined to comment further on Grassleys comments. IBM came to Columbia in 2011, promising to create as many as 800 jobs. The state had no choice but to suspend IBMs tax credits once the headcount fell to fewer than 500, Columbia Mayor Bob McDavid said in an interview. Would I love to have 800 employees? he said. Of course. Back in Dubuque, IBM is considering leasing two floors in its building downtown, according to the Dubuque Telegraph Herald. Despite predictions that the companys presence would prompt other large tech companies and startups to set up shop in the citys revitalized downtown, it hasnt happened. Nor has Dubuque lured other companies with the same cachet as Big Blue. Existing employers such as Hormel Foods Corp. and Deere & Co. have added to their workforces but typically pay lower wages than IBM. Only a handful of small firms have moved into the technology park constructed about the time IBM arrived. Dickinson, the local official, said IBMs employee commitment to Dubuque probably was unrealistic given the fast-moving nature of the tech services industry. Four years is light years in technology, he said.

Contained within the bill were numerous provisions that greatly benefitted Hawaii, such as $470 million in military construction, plans to make improvements to the Red hill Underground Fuel Facility, and grants to local educational agencies to repair, renovate, and expand elementary and secondary public schools on military installations. In addition, I passed a provision to help our men and women in the Armed Services who gain experience in the maritime trades during their military career, transition to careers in the U.S. Merchant Marine. I chose to support the passage of the NDAA because of the overwhelmingly positive benefits for Hawaii. While I recognize and understand some of my colleagues concerns with the bill, my primary responsibility is to the people of Hawaii. I will always be a champion first and foremost for the people I was elected to serve. To learn more about the NDAA and the reason I supported it, please click HERE  . Yesterday, the House passed a measure to reauthorize federal-aid highway and transit programs for two months, through July 31st. The bill passed by the House was simply a stop-gap measure that does not address the bigger concerns surrounding the Highway and Transit Trust Fund, or the fact that the fund becomes insolvent on July 31st. In Honolulu, there 654 bridges, the Department of Transportation in December of 2014, stated that 246 or forty percent of these bridges are deficient. This is an alarming statistic that requires immediate action before the situation deteriorates even further. While I supported the reauthorizing bill, it is long overdue for the House to consider a long-term reauthorization of the trust. If we do not commit resources to the highway fund, we are neglecting crucial infrastructure upgrades that will hurt our country in the future. I will continue to work with my colleagues in order to produce a multi-year extension of the Highway Trust Fund. In order for our country to continue to thrive we need to have a modern infrastructure in place and the Highway and Transit Trust Fund is one of the most viable means of accomplishing that goal.

You can read a tribute to his life published in the Petersburg Progress Index, here, as well as a write up by the Prince George Journal, below. Heroes like Everett Worrell dont just happen. They are forged through faithful acts of courage and integrity over years of service and sacrifice. Everetts service as a B-17 pilot during World War II  when he flew 35 missions over Europe and later as he served our nation for 27 years in the Air Force  speaks both to his character and his commitment to this county. We are proud to remember Everett as a hometown hero, but he is more than that  he is an American hero. As we celebrate his life and legacy, I would like to extend my gratitude and utmost respect to Everett Worrell and the entire Worrell family for all they have given in service to this nation. A grateful nation thanks you. Yours in service, Randy World War II Fighter Pilot, Prince George Resident Everett Worrell Dies At 92 The Prince George Journal May 19, 2015 PRINCE GEORGE COUNTY, VIRGINIA  Prince George lost an American hero when one of the countys oldest living World War II veterans died this month. At the age of 92, Everett Worrell, Jr. who was a B-17 pilot during the second world war and flew 35 missions over Europe, passed away on May 3. He would have turned 93 this month. Heroes like Everett Worrell dont just happen, Congressman Randy Forbes said. They are forged through faithful acts of courage and integrity over years of service and sacrifice. Everetts service as a B-17 pilot during World War II, when he flew 35 missions over Europe and later as he served our nation for 27 years in the Air Force, speak both to his character and his commitment to this county. Worrell was a pilot and Flight Commander with the 532nd Bomb Sq, 381st Bomb Group at Ridgewell, about 25 miles from Duxford. His last combat mission was on January 2, 1945 when he led the group from the IP to over the target when Worrell turned the lead over to Col. Fitzgerald Squad Commander on his last combat mission also. Despite his age, Worrell attended Veterans Day and Memorial Day held in Prince George as late as last year, paying tribute to those who had made the ultimate sacrifices as well as who served and lived to tell about it. Often, the tribute was given to him when others attending applauded the World War II veteran. Worrell served the country for 27 years in the Air Force and was a Communication Inspector General, a Ham Radio operator, and a MARS member for decades. He was one of Richmonds first television repairmen. Supervisor William Gandel, who was close friends with the retired Air Force major, said he would be missed. The two shared a passion for communications. I could talk to him about anything, whether in person, on the air or in Morse code, Gandel said. Ev was the only person I could speak to about anything. Hes always been there for me. Gandel said Worrell was a wealth of knowledge in every aspect. That included music and dancing and, if he started playing all of his records today, 24 hours a day, it would take two weeks to hear them all. He was preceded in death by his wife of 65 years, Hazel. He is survived by four daughters, Elizabeth Lee Dagley and husband, Steve, of Oakridge, Tenn., Anne W. Abeel and husband, Jack, of Disputanta, Va., Linda C. Orlicky and husband, Mark, of Colorado Springs, Colo., and Rebecca L. Agnew and husband, Zander, of Richmond, Va.; eight grandchildren and 11 great-grandchildren. Worrells contributions to his friends, family and the nation will be remembered. We are proud to remember Everett as a hometown hero, but he is more than that  he is an American hero, Forbes noted. As we celebrate his life and legacy, I am honored to extend my gratitude and utmost respect to Everett Worrell and the entire Worrell family for all they have given in service to this nation.

While spending time with your family and loved ones this holiday weekend, I hope you will take a moment to reflect on the meaning behind Memorial Day. Following the conclusion of the Civil War in 1865, government leaders established an annual Decoration Day to commemorate the fallen Union and Confederate soldiers. In the years since, Decoration Day expanded to honor all fallen soldiers from every theater of war and became known as Memorial Day. This weekend, communities across the country will celebrate Memorial Day and honor our troops for their service. I encourage you to check your local paper or contact your State Representative for information related to Memorial Day events and ceremonies throughout our community. I hope you have a wonderful holiday weekend commemorating our country's service members with your loved ones. The men and women whose sacrifices we honor on Memorial Day defended their country out of love for their fellow Americans. It is important to remember their valor in the face of unthinkable danger, and to thank all those who are currently serving and who have served for their bravery. The welfare of our country's military members is an important issue to me. To learn about how I am working in Congress to support and honor our nation's troops and veterans, please visit my website.

Congress has much to do to ensure their return home and their path after service is paved with opportunity for continued success. Let us recall the moving words of President Benjamin Harrison, who said, ""I have never been able to think of the day as one of mourning; I have never quite been able to feel that half-masted flags were appropriate on Decoration Day. I have rather felt that the flag should be at the peak, because those whose dying we commemorate rejoiced in seeing it where their valor placed it. We honor them in a joyous, thankful, triumphant commemoration of what they did.""  Every American owes our armed forces a debt of gratitude we can never fully repay. This Memorial weekend, I encourage everyone to shake the hand of a veteran and say, ""thank you."" Improving Veterans' Lives With that gratitude in mind, the House of Representatives overwhelmingly approved six measures this week to address important veterans' issues. The ""Veteran ID Card Act"" is a simple yet important change to make access veterans services easier. Currently, veterans must cart around their military discharge records, which contain sensitive personal information, to demonstrate proof of their service. I understand the inconvenience and risks associated with carrying such vital documents. H.R. 91 which will make veterans eligible for an official ID card that would allow them to more easily demonstrate their military service record. Much like a driver's license, this Veteran's ID card will acknowledge the veteran was discharged honorably or medically, providing convenience to veterans receiving benefits, simplifying the process for vendors and employers seeking to identify genuine veterans, and reducing the fraud and identity theft perpetrated against veterans. Other bills approved by the House this week include incentives for private sector veteran employment, innovative solutions to veteran homelessness, and needed reforms to hold the Department of Veterans Affairs accountable. Spurring Private Investment and Innovation America's innovative spirit is a strength unmatched by our global competitors. This week in Congress we approved measures to ensure innovation is encouraged and not inhibited by Washington. I was proud to vote in support of the American Research and Competitiveness Act, H.R. 880. Championed by the San Diego and Orange County life-sciences, biotechnology and technology communities, this legislation makes permanent the Research & Development (R&D) tax credit.  Started in 1981, this tax credit encourages businesses to invest more in R&D than they otherwise would. Basic and applied research, often done by neighbors and friends at local institutions and startups in our California communities, is the foundation for medical cures and advancements. And innovation is an engine for long-term economic growth and continued job creation. San Diego's six universities and over 80 research institutes bring billions of dollars to our local economies each year. It is important these institutions remain sustainable to create jobs, opportunities further research and breakthrough technologies, and economic growth for our areas. I am hopeful the President will remove his veto-threat on the bill, and instead see the economic benefits a permanent R&D tax credit will offer our local job creators.

The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (JVTA) is now on its way to the President's desk to be signed into law. JVTA was sponsored in the House by myself and Congresswoman Carolyn Maloney of New York, and in the Senate by Senator Cornyn.

""In a time of seemingly endless partisan gridlock there is one thing we can all agree on: our children are not for sale,"" said Congressman Poe. ""It is hard to believe in the year 2015, there are people living in modern day slavery in America. But that is reality. Human trafficking is a criminal enterprise that exists in cities across the nation, especially in my hometown of Houston, Texas. The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act (JVTA) implements a robust and aggressive strategy to help combat human trafficking in the United States. After years of hard work on this issue, Congress has taken a historic and necessary step today to help end modern day slavery in America. I look forward to President Obama signing JVTA into law so that we can finally help eradicate this scourge."" ""I am pleased to see this important legislation to help victims of human trafficking take another step forward,"" said Senator Cornyn. ""I want to thank my partners in the House of Representatives for their hard work and look forward to President Obama signing this critical bill."" ""The Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act will provide restitution to the survivors of human trafficking and punish those who profit from this horrific crime,"" said Congresswoman Maloney. ""It is a harsh reality that sexual slavery persists across America. With this legislation, Congress has taken a firm stand against the pimps and Johns and for women and children. It has been a privilege to work with Congressman Ted Poe, who as a judge learned first-hand of the destructive nature of these crimes. He has been an unyielding advocate in his work to help the survivors rebuild their lives. I look forward to President Obama signing this legislation into law.""

This new Congress was elected last November to provide leadership and govern effectively on behalf of the American people. Members of both parties need to work together to get results, particularly when it comes to ensuring that our military is ready to combat the diverse threats that our nation faces and making sure that our service members and their families are taken care of. Last week, I shared with you some highlights of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2016 which passed the House on May 15, 2015. After months of bipartisan input, I was pleased that this legislation passed out of the House Armed Services Committee to the House floor with only one dissenting Democrat vote. However, I was later disappointed to see House Democrat Leadership urge 143 of their members to vote against this bipartisan national defense bill on the floor of the House. In doing so, House Democrats voted against increasing troop pay and benefits, against strengthening cyber defenses, against reinforcing the mission to defeat Islamic State in Iraq and Syria terrorists, and against other bipartisan, non-controversial provisions. The NDAA even funded our national defense at and above President Obamas request. House Democrats had a chance to join with House Republicans to deliver a strong victory for our military, their families and the American people. Instead, they chose to play politics by demanding more domestic spending for a variety of programs that have nothing to do with our nations defense. I think we can all agree that political theater is one thing that Washington has enough of already. The American people elected their representatives to Congress to address serious challenges facing our country. These challenges have no easy solutions and will require thoughtful leadership. You can be certain that I will continue to lead on these important issues.

Even as our thoughts and prayers go out to all those affected  and our praise to the first responders  we must commit to action that will stop this cascading series of rail catastrophes. The simple fact is that the Philadelphia tragedy was preventable, and others are predictable if Congress fails to invest in rail infrastructure. The NTSB has determined that speed was a primary factor in this derailment. This train was traveling far too fast  as rapidly as 106 m.p.h. in a 50 m.p.h. zone. Technology like Positive Train Control (PTC), which prevents trains from speeding, would have slowed and saved it. Positive Train Control was first recommended by the NTSB in 1970, and was mandated by Congress in 2008 to be fully implemented by the end of this year. In Philadelphia, eight people would be alive and more than 200 people safe at home, uninjured, with PTC at work. The expense of PTC to Amtrak is about $150 million, while the cost to the Northeast regional economy of shutting down Amtrak is $100 million per day  and the cost in lives is immeasurable. We can no longer patch with makeshift fixes and pray for the best. A few weeks ago, Senator Chuck Schumer and I introduced a bill that would require the swift installation of this critical technology in trains across the nation. Our bill also requires better inspection practices, improved safety at rail grade crossings, and increased safety regulations in work zones to protect rail employees. Ultimately, installing PTC technology would prevent future collisions or derailments caused by excessive speed. Click here to read more about our legislation All too often, our trains and rail technology have been left behind  upgrades have been delayed, and delayed again. PTC is one life-saving technology, but its not enough. The causes of the horrendous derailment and collision in Bridgeport in 2013 were the defective track, cracking joints, decaying ballast, and deficient maintenance  ultimately, all failures to invest. Investment requires addressing these issues, which is why Senator Schumer and I have gone further in proposing a four point plan that would not only require the installation of PTC nationwide, it would provide more resources for safety upgrades at rail crossings, require the implementation of technology to better inspect tracks and enforce speed or safety violations, and it would call on Congress to increase infrastructure spending. Read about our four point plan here Regulatory capture and bureaucratic run-around are far too often the reasons for delays related to railroad improvements, and they were assuredly the reasons for delays in PTC installation. It is critical now that the Federal Railroad Administration and National Transportation Safety Board complete a swift and thorough investigation so we can know all of the causes that lead to this calamitous event. These federal watchdog agencies must work with Congress to ensure that we make swift and significant investments, and prioritize our countrys rail network. Crashes and derailments leading to mayhem and death have become far too common, contributing to an alarming spike in railroad-related deaths this last year, and loss of public trust and confidence. I will continue this fight in the Senate.

[R-NJ11]","Congressman Rodney Frelinghuysen, Representing the 11th District of New Jersey *e-News 5/21/15*  *Memorial Day Weekend: Honoring Sacrifices that Protect our Families* Residents of Morris, Essex, Passaic and Sussex counties will gather in their hometowns this weekend to remember our unbroken line of heroes stretching back to the days when General George Washington encamped at nearby Jockey Hollow, part of the Morristown National Historical Park. Since the founding of the Republic, the sons and daughters of New Jersey have always stepped forward to serve. And from the battles of Afghanistan and Iraq, to the Korean and Vietnam wars, to the trials of World Wars, to the struggles that made us a nation, their names remind us that freedom is not free. Our nation **is** free and safe because of brave Americans like these who volunteer to confront our adversaries abroad so we do not have to face them here at home. These volunteers do the work of freedom so we can all live, work and raise our families today in the greatest nation on the face of the earth! I know I speak for all of my fellow veterans when I say that no one loves peace more than the soldier. That is precisely why all Americans should commit themselves today to the principle first paraphrased in George Washingtons first State of the Union message in 1790: **peace through strength.** This weekend we must never forget that we are truly a nation at war and the ongoing military operations in Afghanistan, Iraq, Syria and elsewhere around the globe make this weekend particularly important. Therefore, on Memorial Day 2015, we should remember the words of President Harry Truman: *Our debt to the heroic men and valiant women in the service of our country can never be repaid. They have earned our undying gratitude. America will never forget their sacrifices. * Our prayers are also with those recuperating from wounds of war and veterans suffering the effects of their service and the families that care for them. So, this weekend, I hope you will take time to honor the men and women who have worn the nation's uniform and were last seen standing duty.

Run by the Department of the Army, 389 gravesites honor the sacrifice of those who served over a century ago with the same pride and commitment to American democracy that our current All Volunteer Army possesses. As Americans, we must continue to honor all our fallen soldiers, sailors, airmen, and Marines who have given their last full measure to our country. On this Memorial Day, I encourage you to visit our own Presidio Cemetery or other national cemeteries as tranquil oases of verdant green, memorializing the souls of those who died in service to protect the lives and liberties of our nation. I am proud of every resident of the Central Coast who has served our nation with honor and distinction, and offer my thanks not only to those who have worn a military uniform, but also to their families who silently serve. We stand with them in their grief. As the longest-serving member of the House Appropriations Committee on Military Construction and Veterans Affairs, I work hard to ensure that the lives of our servicemen and women are properly honored when the ultimate price for our freedom is paid. Each time I visit Arlington National Cemetery, our nation's most hallowed burial grounds, I recall with pride and joy the excitement when we broke ground on our own Central Coast Veterans Cemetery at Fort Ord. This extraordinary example of the tenacity and perseverance of our community on behalf of our veterans is a testament to how dedicated the Central Coast is to honoring those who have served. Slated to open in mid-2016, I look forward to commemorating the first veterans who will be interred there and commend the efforts of all those involved who worked with me to make this cemetery a reality. American poet Joseph Drake said, ""They who for their country die shall fill an honored grave, for glory lights the soldier's tomb, and beauty weeps the brave."" With these words, we offer our solemn respect for all of our nation's fallen soldiers who have earned the title 'Hero' because they bravely fought and died on behalf of the United States of America.

[R-VA7]","News from Representative Brat  Website  Subscribe to Newsletter  Constituent Services  Legislative Resources  Press Shop  About Dave  Contact Dave  Dear Friend, Last week, I voted to protect district farmers from EPA overreachspecifically, the House voted to repeal a regulation that could ultimately force district farmers and families to seek permits to use water on their own lands. Many farmers and landowners were preparing for the EPA to mandate that they fence in ponds and ditches on their properties because of the agencys pending Waters of the United States rule. The EPA announced the proposed rule last year. Its a plan to radically redefine the scope of the waters the federal government can regulate. Prior to the proposal, the term Waters of the United States traditionally governed navigable waters, such as those navigated by boats or ships. Under the EPAs proposed new definition, many other waters that flow or accumulate anywhere in the United States  such as drainage ditches, farm ponds, and even seasonally wet areas  could be subject to regulation. This would mean that if a heavy rain deposited a stream of water on ones property, under certain circumstances, the federal government could regulate it. This revision represents a massive overreach by the federal government as it attempts to seep into the private property of American families. As Ive traveled throughout my district, Ive met farmers, ranchers, developers, local government officials, and average homeowners who have all expressed their deep concerns about this overreach. This proposal could impact property owners by forcing them to get permits to use water on their own lands. Im proud to have voted for H.R. 1732, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act, which gives the EPA 30 days to withdraw its proposed rule and write a new rule after gaining consensus from the public, state and local officials, and other stakeholders about which waters and wetlands should be covered. This bipartisan bill reins in part of the rampant regulatory machine that Washington has become. It passed the House 261-155.

That's why I'm working with my colleagues to honor the indomitable courage and selfless sacrifice of veterans transitioning into civilian careers.

Mismanagement permeates the entire Veterans Affairs health care system. We recently learned  that at least $6 billion taxpayer dollars per year have been squandered in illegal contracts for medical care and supplies  wasting our money, but more importantly: putting our veterans at risk.  VA employees improperly accepted gifts including room upgrades, meals, limousine services, golf, spa services, helicopter rides, and even tickets for the Rockettes. Im committed to being part of the solution. This week the House passed six bills that give Americas veterans the support they need and demand accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs: H.R. 1382  , Boosting Rates of American Veteran Employment Act H.R. 1313  , Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Relief Act H.R. 1038  , Ensuring VA Employee Accountability Act H.R. 474  , Homeless Veterans Reintegration Programs Reauthorization Act of 2015 H.R. 91  , Veterans I.D. Card Act H.R. 1816  , Vulnerable Veterans Housing Reform Act of 2015. We must continue to question the VA, hold them accountable, and demand reform. We will not stop until our veterans are provided the health care they earned. Next week I will visit the Spokane Veterans Hospital to recognize those who have worked hard every day to serve our Veterans. And every day my team is actively working with Veterans in Eastern Washington. This week my team attended the VA 2K Relay for Homeless Veterans with members of the military, the community, and VA staff; were helping to facilitate participation with the Supported Services for Veterans Families program at Goodwill Industries of the Inland Northwest at the Veterans gathering in Republic this weekend; and were working with the County leaders to assess needs of Veterans in rural areas and bring VA services to those living in remote and rural areas. Please watch this video  of my speech today on the house floor. Post your comments or questions to FB  and I will respond later today. Thank you for your concern about this important issue. Together we can make a difference. I am committed to making a difference for our veterans, and I want to work with everyone in our community to help enact meaningful solutions at the VA.

,114,Male,N00006052,43397,"Thornberry, Mac (Rep.) [R-TX13]","Dear Friends, Id like to update you on two important pieces of legislation that will greatly impact many folks in our area. Private property rights are vital to our American way of life. It is the foundation for our homes, our livelihoods, and our opportunity to provide a better future for coming generations. That is why alarms sounded when rights to Texas land were called into question by the federal government. Senator Cornyn and I introduced legislation to help protect the property rights of landowners who own property along the Red River that was claimed by the Bureau of Land Management (BLM). Many of these land owners possess deeds and have been paying taxes on this property for decades. Originally claiming 90,000 acres along a 116-mile stretch of the Red River, the BLM has now lowered its estimates of land it may own to 30,000 acres. Only 6,402 of those acres have actually been surveyed by the federal government. The Red River Private Property Protection Act (H.R. 2130) seeks to eliminate any cloud of uncertainty for landowners once and for all. For more detailed information, click here. Recently, I cosponsored another bill, the Rural Veterans Travel Enhancement Act of 2015, (H.R. 2291), that would permanently authorize the VAs ability to transport veterans to and from their healthcare appointments. It is a cost-effective program to help veterans access healthcare by saving on ambulance costs and offering mileage reimbursements. This program allowed the Amarillo VA to transport 6,047 veterans to and from appointments between October 1, 2014, and March 31, 2015. This bill also reauthorizes a grant program for five years to support Veterans Services Organizations that transport veterans in highly rural areas who are seeking medical care, like many in our area. I also adds new mileage reimbursement for veterans traveling to Vet Centers, where they can receive post-war readjustment counseling. Improving veteran access to healthcare does not only mean having enough providers. It requires us to ensure that veterans are able to get to their appointments with those providers. We owe it to those who faithfully served our country. For more detailed information, click here. I will continue to keep you updated on these bills and other legislation as the year progresses.

[R-AL3]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email   Dear Mrs. Cormack, As many of you across East Alabama may have seen or heard in the news, the National Defense Authorization Act recently passed the House of Representatives with my strong support. This critical piece of legislation outlines how Congress will support our nation's military. I was relieved to see that Congress increased the overall authorized funding for our nation's military. Several key provisions important to East Alabama made it into the bill. The first was a commitment to help protect jobs at important military facilities like the Anniston Army Depot, one of the Army's most productive and efficient facilities. Folks across East Alabama may remember a few years ago when the Depot had to furlough some workers because of the Pentagon's poor budget management. This new provision would protect facilities like the Depot that operate under the Working Capital Fund from being forced to furlough workers in order to meet arbitrary budget demands from the Pentagon. Another was my amendment to allow the Army to transfer its surplus vintage firearms to the Civilian Marksmanship Program (CMP) which has its southern headquarters in Anniston and will soon have the CMP park open in June in Talladega County. If you're a gun owner like I am, you may be familiar with the M1911A1. This iconic pistol used to serve as the standard U.S. Armed Forces sidearm, until it was replaced by the Berretta 9mm pistol. Although a few thousand of these pistols have been sold to foreign countries for a small fee, the remainder are being held in storage. That costs the taxpayer about $200,000 a year. As a strong supporter of Second Amendment rights, I believe this bill is a common-sense approach to not only save the taxpayer money, but allows gun collectors to add this vintage pistol to their collection. It is my hope that both provisions will stay in the bill as the process moves forward in the Senate. I also hope the Administration will ultimately support them. Providing for our national defense is a top priority to keep our country safe and our defenses strong. As always, my  staff and I are here to serve you.

McCaul on Fox News Sunday Futures  McCaul on America's Newsroom  Following recent allegations that the Clinton Foundation neglected to disclose millions of dollars in donations from foreign governments and facilitated business transactions for foreign entities while Hillary Clinton was Secretary of State, I joined 50 of my colleagues this week in requesting the IRS review the tax-exempt status of the Clinton Foundation  . The allegations are deeply troubling and if found to be true, then the Clinton Foundation should lose its tax exempt status.

Issues  Press  Schedule a Meeting  facebook  you tube  tweeter   May 21, 2014 Dear Cormack, Last week, the House of Representatives passed a bipartisan defense authorization bill  for 2016 that maintains critical investments in our national security, our regional economy, and our military families. In my new role as Ranking Member of the Seapower Subcommittee of the House Armed Services Committee, I am particularly pleased to have worked on many portions of this bill that are critical for eastern Connecticut, including funding for constructing two Virginia Class submarines in 2016 in accordance with the Navy's Block IV contract, funding for the Virginia Payload Module, and research and design funding for the Ohio Replacement Program (ORP), which will create the next generation of ballistic missile submarines. Because ORP is a vital national security investment that will last for generations and transcends the mission of the Navy, I worked to establish the National Sea Based Deterrence Fund last year. The fund is a Defense Department account, separate from the Navy's regular shipbuilding account, which gives the Secretary of Defense additional latitude to shift funding from other areas to help make this multigenerational investment. During consideration of the bill on the House floor, an amendment was offered to eliminate this bipartisan initiative - and I am proud to have led an effort to defeat this measure resoundingly. The impact of these programs at home in eastern Connecticut is unmistakable. Last week, I met with representatives from the UConn School of Engineering, who shared that a remarkable number of their students-almost ten percent-graduated this month with a job lined up at Electric Boat. This summer, the company will host 49 undergraduate engineering interns from UConn. As production of the Ohio Replacement Class ramps up, EB is preparing by recruiting engineers, designers, and waterfront trades workers.  Welder John Alves at the March, 2015 keel laying ceremony for the Virginia Class submarine U.S.S. Colorado (SSN788). Although the majority of the 2016 NDAA was negotiated in a bipartisan approach in the House Armed Services Committee, House Republican leaders chose to deploy a budget gimmick that shifts additional funds to the Overseas Contingency Operations Account, in order to avoid caps set by the Budget Control Act. Earlier this year, I strongly opposed the budget resolution that created this gimmick, and I have voted on multiple occasions against the irresponsible policy of sequestration that is harming our nation's ability to investment in our economy and national security. But the alternative-to oppose this critical policy bill and abide the restrictive budget caps on this measure that will prevent critical investments in military assets-was not an approach I could support. I continue to call for balanced and bipartisan compromise to address the continued threat that sequestration poses to the entirety of our budget, not just defense. Congress must act swiftly to eliminate this threat, and I am ready to work with leadership on both sides of the aisle to find a solution. Apart from the current debate over budget issues, the 2016 NDAA was the product of a thoughtful, bipartisan process in the House Armed Services Committee-a rarity in Congress these days. Although the bill passed in the House is not perfect, I stand by the debate and compromise that Committee members worked through to craft a bill that invests in our military personnel and their families, shipbuilding, and aircraft construction priorities. The NDAA process has been a model for bipartisan cooperation for decades, and that process for this year's bill fits that model, to the benefit of our region.

[R-IN4]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email   Website  About Me  Issues  Media Center  Contact Me  Dear Friend, Thank you for the opportunity to update you on the work of the 114th Congress. I trust this finds you and your family well, as we work together to bring Hoosier common sense to Washington. For daily updates, please take a moment to ""Like"" my Facebook page by clicking here  or follow me on Twitter if you prefer  @ToddRokita. _____ In this week's Rokita Report * Lesson from Commodore Decatur * Responsibly Protecting Workers * Child Nutrition Oversight * Innovation Week _____ Lesson From Commodore Decatur Commodore Stephen Decatur was born in 1779 and was one of the first post-Revolutionary War heroes of our country. Decatur, Indiana is named after him. Two hundred years ago, on May 20, 1815, he was given command of the USS Guerriere by President James Madison and instructed to conduct a war to end the piracy that had been rampant in the region. By November, he returned a hero having confronted the issue directly and bringing about a swift victory. Secretary of State James Monroe even wrote a letter to Decatur stating ""I take much interest in informing you that the result of this expedition, so glorious to your country and honorable to yourself and the officers and men under your command, has been very satisfactory to the President."" Two hundred years later, his journey is still relevant. Recently, in the Persian Gulf, in what amounts to state-sponsored piracy, Iran seized a foreign vessel, the Maersk-Tigris, under the pretext of ""legal disputes"" on the waters. This happened at the same time our President was negotiating with Iran about nuclear enrichment. Two hundred years ago our nation confronted piracy head-on. Today this administration is more interested in brokering a deal and turning a blind eye to such behavior. Last week's Rokita Report discussed how Congress voted overwhelmingly on legislation that ensures oversight over the President's negotiations with Iran. Actions like seizing the Maersk-Tigris demonstrate the importance of doing so. _____ Responsibly Protecting Workers Today, I introduced a bipartisan bill to make permanent a key voluntary workplace safety program. The Voluntary Protection Program (VPP) is a successful partnership between private industry and the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA), which was created in 1982 but never codified into law. In the VPP, management, employees, and OSHA establish cooperative workplace relationships to implement a comprehensive safety and health management system. The bill that I introduced is the VPP Act and it would make this program permanent. I introduced the bill with Representatives Gene Green (D-TX) and Martha Roby (R-AL). Since VPP was created in 1982, it has grown to incorporate over 2,200 worksites that employ approximately 900,000 workers. Participating workplaces have an illness and injury rate well below industry averages. States, including Indiana, have created their own programs modeled on the success of the federal program. _____ Child Nutrition Oversight On Tuesday, as Chairman of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, I held a hearing that examined waste, fraud, and abuse in federal child nutrition programs. Every year, the federal government spends more than $21 billion on child nutrition programs. For this reason, we owe it to taxpayers to ensure their dollars are reaching the children that need it most by cracking down on waste, fraud, and abuse. According to the Government Accountability Office, taxpayer dollars are often being misdirected to individuals ineligible for these programs. The Department of Agriculture's Inspector General identified $2.7 billion in improper payments in just one school year.  Chairing the Hearing on the Child Nutrition Oversight  The hearing was all the more important because federal child nutrition programs, including the Supplemental Nutritional Program for Women, Infants, and Children (WIC), the National School Lunch Program, and the School Breakfast Program are due to be reauthorized by Congress later this year. Each and every dollar spent on these programs should have a direct and meaningful impact on those it is intended to serve  not those looking to cheat the system. The hearing builds upon last month's hearing ""Serving Students and Families through Child Nutrition Programs"" that was held by the full committee. Using the ideas and proposals gathered from these hearings, I will continue working to strengthen transparency and accountability in these programs as Congress drafts legislation reauthorizing these programs. _____ Innovation Week This week was Innovation Week in the House of Representatives. Our focus was to ensure that we have the tools we need to ensure that America remains a leader in research, while cutting waste and abuse. Indiana is at the forefront of innovation: * Purdue University in West Lafayette attracts global talent to world-class research facilities and stands to benefit from the bills passed this week. Neil Armstrong, the first man on the moon, was a Boilermaker. * Last year, Fair Oaks Dairy, an Indiana company, drew the attention of NPR  for their agricultural technologies that produce a ""nutritious, reformulated supermilk."" * Earlier this month, executives with Amazon told me how impressed they were with the 5,000 Hoosiers they employ in Indiana. This work ethic is a reason that they are building a wind farm in Benton County to power their data centers. Innovation spans wide fields of research and industries, and so too does the legislation that was passed this week: * The Weather Research and Forecasting Innovation Act prioritizes the protection of lives and property in the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's weather research plans. * The Research and Development Efficiency Act reviews federal research regulations for unnecessary requirements, burdens, and duplication to save costs. * The American Super Computing Leadership Act improves high-end computing research and development programs and establishes an exascale computing program. * The America COMPETES Reauthorization Act is a comprehensive bill that prioritizes scientific research and ensures we are getting the best bang for our buck, not paying for someone else's political agenda. * The SPACE Act is legislation that extends the Federal Aviation Administration's (FAA) learning period on private spaceflight to 2023 so research can be done free from regulatory uncertainty. _____ Thank you for your continued interest in Congress and for supporting my efforts to bring Hoosier common sense to Washington.

,114,Male,N00028958,43471,"Chaffetz, Jason (Rep.) [R-UT3]"," News from Congressman Chaffetz  Recently in Washington FEDERAL RULES SUPPORT INCOMPETENCE Just what does a federal employee have to do to get fired? Former DEA Administrator Michelle Leonhart testified  she could not fire DEA agents who let drug cartels provide them with prostitutes. EPA Administrator Gina McCarthy testified she was working through a lengthy process to fire a senior EPA official who spent more than 4 hours a day viewing porn on his government computer. Last month, I wrote an opinion piece  for Politico describing some of my concerns. Holding people accountable for unacceptable behavior is a critical priority and one I intend to pursue unequivocally. I'm pleased that Leonhart resigned after our hearing exposed her failure to appropriately hold people accountable for their outrageous behavior.   INSPECTOR GENERAL: DRUNKEN SECRET SERVICE AGENTS LIED Following an investigation of a security breach involving allegedly intoxicated Secret Service agents, the Inspector General testified last week about his findings. His report  indicated agents spent about 5 hours at a bar, running up a significant bar tab before driving their government vehicle to the White House on March 4. You can watch my opening statements at the hearing here  and my questioning of the Inspector General here  and here  . Last week I spoke with CNN's Wolf Blizter about the recent breaches.  LEGISLATIVE PROGRESS Committee Markup - Before most bills are ever heard on the House Floor, they must pass through a committee ""markup"" in which the bill is debated and amendments offered. This week, the Oversight & Government Reform Committee marked up two of my bills. HR 1777  reforms presidential compensation, reducing pay for former presidents who earn more than $400,000 a year. You can read more about this bill in the Salt Lake Tribune  or Politico  . HR 2395  empowers Inspectors General who investigate waste, fraud and abuse in the executive branch. With strong committee support, these two bipartisan bills now advance for consideration on the House Floor. APPREHENSION FROM OUR ALLIES IN THE MIDDLE EAST I have deep concerns about the state of our relationships with our allies in the Middle East. My recent visit to Saudi Arabia confirmed that our Arab partners are apprehensive about the Administration's efforts to forge a nuclear deal with Iran. After President Obama hosted some of these allies at Camp David last week, I spoke  with CNN's Wolf Blitzer about my concerns:  GOOD NEWS ON CELL PHONE TRACKING The Department of Justice's recent announcement  that it will review policies on the use of Stingrays (devices which imitate a cell phone tower, force cell phones nearby to connect, and provide law enforcement with information) is welcome news. In this digital age it is vital that we strike the right balance between personal privacy and national security. The Oversight Committee will continue its bipartisan investigation into the use of these devices. You can read more at the Washington Post  or Buzzfeed  .

[D-NM]","May 21, 2015 Dear Friend, I hope you take a moment to read the following op-ed Senator Tom Udall and I wrote celebrating the one-year anniversary of the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument, which was published in the Las Cruces Sun-Newstoday. Last weekend, I was in southern New Mexico highlighting the success of the national monument with local residents. I'd like to thank the community for coming together to support the preservation of these shared lands. For over a decade, and with the leadership of former Senator Jeff Bingaman, local groups worked tirelessly to promote the unique and priceless natural features of the area. The creation of the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument truly was a group effort, and I commend the people of southern New Mexico for this achievement. I hope you'll take a moment to read the op-ed below, and pleasekeep in touch. Sincerely, MARTIN HEINRICH United States Senator (Senator Heinrich at a cookout at the Mesilla Valley Bosque State Park with local residents, business owners, and members of the New Mexico Wildlife Federation)  May 21, 2015 U.S. Sens Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich: Anniversary of monument designation a reason to celebrate By U.S. Senators Tom Udall and Martin Heinrich The local coalition recently is hosting a series of anniversary events this week in Las Cruces; and if you didn't already get the chance, we hope everyone soon will take the opportunity to enjoy and celebrate this very special national monument right here in our own backyard. On May 21, 2014, we watched proudly as a proclamation establishing the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument --right here in southern New Mexico -- was signed by President Obama. Now, one year later, we celebrate this incredible landscape, the many years of grassroots support that made it possible, and the economic benefit it is already creating for the surrounding communities. While there is more work to be done to fully realize the potential of this attraction, we are happy to report that there are exciting signs of a positive impact on our economy. Many Las Cruces businesses have reported that customers and visitors to the area are asking them about the monument, and entrepreneurs are introducing specialty products and recreation opportunities to capitalize on the heightened interest. The Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument is incredibly rich in cultural and natural history, biology and wildlife, and recreational opportunities. It includes five stunning mountain ranges -- not just the well-known Organs, but also the Robledos, Potrillos, Doa Anas, and the Sierra de las Uvas. Far below these mountain peaks in the fertile Mesilla Valley, canyons and lowlands teem with plant and animal life and historic and prehistoric artifacts. Ancient residents left their marks and their stories in the form of rock art on many of the caves and sheer canyon walls throughout the monument. Billy the Kid once spent time in the mountains, and rumor has it that Apache leader Geronimo sought safe haven in a nearby cave while on the run from U.S. forces. In more recent times the region was home to bombing targets during World War II and training grounds for Apollo astronauts. Today, people are drawn to the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks region for many reasons. Geologists, archeologists, biologists, historians, and other scientists come to conduct research, while outdoor enthusiasts enjoy unparalleled hiking, camping, and hunting opportunities. Even less adventurous New Mexicans may enjoy a peaceful walk or sunny picnic in the monument, and business owners are happy to welcome out-of-town visitors interested in exploring. Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks was created with the highest regard for the goals and priorities of a wide range of stakeholders, and it preserves our abundant natural heritage and resources for generations to come. The land included in the monument was and continues to be managed by the Bureau of Land Management and allows for grazing leases and related access to the land that are important to the ranching community and our local economy. The national monument designation also ensures that the U.S. Border Patrol and military installations continue to have appropriate access to keep our borders safe. Additionally, we will be introducing legislation to finish the proposal for the area by designating eight new wilderness areas within the monument and releasing wilderness study area restrictions within five miles of the international border to give additional flexibility to Border Patrol officers working in the area. These provisions can only be accomplished through legislation, not a monument proclamation. We hope that the designation of the Organ Mountains-Desert Peaks National Monument will encourage all New Mexicans to explore and enjoy their public lands.

,114,Male,N00030676,43554,"Long, Billy (Rep.) [R-MO7]","Congressman Billy Long ====================================== For more than a year, the House Energy and Commerce Committee (E&C) has been working with doctors, patients, drug manufacturers, government researchers and regulators to investigate how we, as Congress, can help advancements in American medical innovation and treatments. This week, these efforts passed E&C unanimously, 51-0, to be brought before the full House of Representatives. The *21st Century Cures Act* [link 1]would take multiple approaches to enhance the federal governments positive impact on medical research and development and while breaking down regulations hindering medical advancements. The bill would facilitate public-private partnerships to spur further innovation, establish a priority process for the Food and Drug Administrations (FDA) review of breakthrough medical devices and treatments, and grant additional resources to federal agencies such as FDA, National Institutes of Health, Centers for Disease Control and Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Service. This only scratches the surface. In the fields of medical research and drug development, government should not be what holds America back from reaching our full potential. *21st Century Cures* is a strong step to make that a reality. For example, I am the lead sponsor of H.R. 2452 [link 2], which is included in *21st Century Cures* as section 2101. It would allow drug manufacturers, which have the most in-depth sophisticated information about their products, to share important data with certain health care professionals. This would arm medical providers with scientifically-sound economic data needed to ensure the most effective and efficient treatments for specific patients with specific conditions. Doctors would have better understanding of which drugs work best for certain patients, opening informed competition and driving innovation for better drugs and successful treatments. *21st Century Cures *is groundbreaking landmark legislation that would do wonders to streamline researchers and scientists work to develop cures and treatments of modern day diseases. It would give doctors the tools they need to provide Americans with high-quality, world class care.

My number one goal has always been to provide the highest level of constituent services possible. If you need help with a federal agency, please do not hesitate to contact my district office. I hope that you will reach out to me to express your views about legislation and issues important to you. It is with your input that I can best advocate for our community. It is an honor to serve as your voice in Congress.

Along with key stakeholders of the transportation community, I am committed to working with my colleagues in Congress on a new surface transportation authorization bill that addresses the growing backlog of transportation projects nationwide and brings our highways, transit, and rail networks to a state of good repair. I look forward to working on a bill that will keep Ventura County  and our nation  moving forward! [image = Congresswoman Brownley participates in a ""Stand Up 4 Transportation"" event in Oxnard to talk about how she is advocating for Ventura County's transportation needs as a new member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee.  * [link 12]Brownley announces over $300,000 for Ventura County airports* I was pleased to announce that the Camarillo Airport will receive $310,500 from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) for critical infrastructure improvement projects. The Camarillo Airport is a vital economic driver in our region. I am pleased to see the FAA continue to recognize this fact by providing much-needed funding to our local airports, which will help ensure the vitality of Ventura Countys diverse economy. [image = [link 13]  * [link 14]Brownley meets with California Avocado Commission* Did you know that California produces about 90 percent of the nations avocado crop? This month, I met with the California Avocado Commission to discuss the many successes and challenges they are facing including water and labor issues. I look forward to working with our local avocado growers to address their concerns and support this thriving, delicious, and healthy crop in our region. [image = Brownley discusses the issues facing our regional avocado industry and how she is advocating for Ventura County's agricultural community in Congress.  * [link 15]Brownley advocates for independent redistricting commissions* As a member of the Democracy Task Force, I am committed to ensuring that our democracy works for the American people. Recently, I co-authored legislation that would develop citizen-driven redistricting commissions nationwide. We must return the levers of power in our democracy to our nation's citizens and restore faith in the democratic process. Read my op-ed in the Ventura County Star below. [image = [link 16]  * [link 17]Brownley tours Sun Valley Floral Farms in Oxnard* Recently, I had the pleasure of touring Sun Valley Floral Farms in Oxnard. As a member of the Congressional Cut Flower Caucus, I was thrilled to see the dedication of our local flower growers firsthand. I would especially like to thank Lane DeVries, a fourth-generation grower and current Chairman of the California Cut Flower Commission, for his insight and extensive knowledge of the beautiful flowers and foliage that they grow. In Congress, I will continue to be an advocate for legislation that will help grow our local agricultural industry, including cut flowers, to ensure the vitality of our region's economy.

It is paramount that this country supports women and families, and veterans. We have both a moral obligation and an economic imperative to do so. My bill would provide all veterans in need of VA health care, who are primary caretakers, access to child care while also allowing VA facilities the flexibility to ensure that these programs meet local needs. Making this much-needed program permanent will remove an important barrier to enabling our veterans to receive the care that they have earned and deserve. Click on the photo below to read my release. [image = Brownley participates in a House Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing to discuss the importance of ensuring that female veterans have equal access to VA healthcare and services as their male colleagues, which includes access to child care.  * [link 19]Brownley offers amendment to FY2016 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill* As Ranking Member of the House Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Health, I believe that cutting corners on VA funding compromises Congresss commitment to our nations veterans. I spoke on the House floor to offer an amendment to the FY2016 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill that would have restored funding for major construction projects in the VA to $1.14 billion, to meet the level that the VA has requested. Watch my remarks below. [image = [link 20] Congresswoman Brownley speaks on the House floor to discuss her amendment to the FY2016 Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill that would ensure Congress provides adequate funding to VA facilities and keeps faith with Congress's commitment to our nation's veterans.  * [link 21]Brownley meets with U.S. Coast Guard* Recently, I met with the U.S. Coast Guard including Rear Admiral Joe Servidio, who oversees multi-mission Coast Guard operations from the California-Oregon border to Peru, including the operations at U.S. Coast Guard Station Channel Islands. As a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation, I look forward to working more closely with the U.S. Coast Guard to support their missions and activities. [image = Brownley meets with the U.S. Coast Guard Rear Admiral to discuss how she is advocating for the interests of the U.S. Coast Guard as a member of the House Transportation and Infrastructure Subcommittee on Coast Guard and Maritime Transportation.  * [link 22]Brownley tours local manufacturer Raypak* I had the opportunity to tour Raypak, a leading manufacturer and distributor of commercial and residential water boilers, air conditioners, heaters, and pool and spa heat pumps. On our tour, we discussed how Congress can continue to support American manufacturing, such as by advancing Make it in America legislation.  [image = Brownley takes a tour of Raypak facilities in Oxnard and discusses the importance of her bill, the American Manufacturing Jobs for Students Act.  * [link 23]Brownley attends Vietnam War exhibit at Museum of Ventura County * Recently, I had the opportunity to attend the opening of the ""We Remember: From Ventura County to Vietnam and Back"" exhibit at the Museum of Ventura County. This exhibit pays tribute to Ventura County's Vietnam veterans, including the 108 men who were killed in action, through artifacts, documentary photographs, personal effects and audio and video recordings.As a member of the House Veterans' Affairs Committee, I was pleased to have this opportunity to discuss legislation important to the veterans community, and how I am advocating for our community's veterans in Congress on a daily basis.

I hope you are all having a productive week in preparation for the long weekend! Over the last two weeks, I have been in Washington and New Hampshire working on behalf of Granite State families. I was so excited to welcome Nashua native Mark Laing to Washington and show him around the Capitol during Foster Youth Shadow Day. I also joined members of New Hampshire's law enforcement community to honor the memory of Officer Stephen Arkell, advocated for Granite State veterans at two Veterans' Affairs hearings, and announced federal funding for infrastructure improvements in three North Country communities.  Welcoming Mark Laing for Foster Youth Shadow Day I was delighted to welcome Mark to Washington for the fourth annual Congressional Foster Youth Shadow Day - his excitement and curiosity were inspiring. Nearly 70 foster youth and alumni from across the country traveled to Washington to shadow members of Congress in order to get a behind-the-scenes look at the inner workings of the House of Representatives. During National Foster Care month, Mark and the other participants in this fantastic program remind us that even in the face of difficult challenges, so many foster children exhibit strength and optimism. I am committed to helping ensure all foster children have the support they need to live healthy and happy lives, and I was grateful for the opportunity to hear directly from Mark about how Congress can work to support and improve our nation's foster care system. Honoring a Fallen Hero During National Police Week, I joined with the New Hampshire Police Association and other guests to honor the memory of New Hampshire police officer Stephen Arkell. Arkell was an 18-year veteran of the Brentwood Police Department who was killed in the line of duty in May of last year. Officer Arkell dedicated his life to serving our community, and his bravery and courage were a true testament to the incredible work of our first responders to keep us safe. Officer Arkell was known for his kindness, selflessness, and deep commitment to family, friends, and the Granite State. I was proud to join with many of his fellow officers to honor his memory as his name was added to the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial. Officer Arkell will always be remembered as a pillar of his community, and we thank him for his life's work protecting New Hampshire families.   Questioning VA officials on the implementation of the choice card program Improving Care for Granite State Veterans During a House Veterans' Affairs Committee hearing on the implementation of the Veterans Choice Card program, I urged VA officials to encourage measures that would ensure continuity of care between the VA and community service providers. We must ensure that our veterans can receive the highest quality of care, regardless of their location. That's why we must put mechanisms in place to encourage continuity of care between the VA and any local providers that are serving our veterans. When a veteran visits a medical center, that center should be able to easily access that veteran's medical records electronically, which will cut down on the possibility of medical error and increase efficiency of care. Let's make sure all of our local VAs have the capability to provide this support, even when veterans are visiting non-VA facilities. I also questioned VA officials about purchase card cost overruns at the VA during a House Veterans' Affairs Subcommittee Hearing on Oversight and Investigations (O&I). As the Ranking Member on the O&I Subcommittee, I was appalled to hear that the VA, which is already plagued by a number of other scandals, has been consistently misusing purchase cards and allowing indiscriminate spending to run rampant. While we must ensure that our veterans have access to high-quality services, resources, and medical equipment, the VA must be held accountable for failing to monitor its spending and wasting billions of dollars on equipment that could have been purchased much more efficiently using contract bidding or other monitored processes. At a time when every cent should be going towards improving health outcomes for our veterans, the VA does not have money to waste - and we must put an end to this egregious practice once and for all. A Win for Infrastructure in the North Country I was excited to announce funding from the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program to help repair and improve water and wastewater infrastructure in three towns in the North Country. Rural Development's Water and Waste Disposal Loan and Grant program awarded the town of Lancaster a $1,563,000 grant and $2,975,000 loan; the town of Colebrook a $2,054,000 grant and $2,688,000 loan; and the town of Northumberland a $1,288,300 grant and $1,569,000 loan to replace critical water systems and improve wastewater treatment systems. New Hampshire must improve its aging infrastructure in order to stay competitive in the 21st century economy and to maintain public safety and well-being in communities across the state. I've been a longtime advocate of protecting USDA Rural Development funds. In the Granite State's many rural areas, Rural Development funding helps our communities maintain water infrastructure and wastewater treatment systems, protecting our environment and public health. I congratulate the towns of Lancaster, Colebrook, and Northumberland on receiving these grants and loans, which will help them complete important projects and will benefit their residents for years to come.

[R-NJ7]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email   Dear Friend, Memorial Day is a time when Americans pay tribute, honor and remember those who have served our country bravely and sacrificed their lives in the name of freedom and democracy. Across the country we will honor our fallen heroes over the coming days at picnics, county fairs and town parades. We not only memorialize those gone but we give thanks to the more than 20 million American veterans alive today. These brave service men and women have made significant sacrifices and we have an obligation to honor them by ""keeping the promise"" to those who have worn the uniform. To this end, the House of Representatives approved unanimously a series of bills  recently aimed at better serving our Nation's veterans. These bipartisan measures represent another step in our on-going effort to address the problems at the VA, improve vet-related services, increase access to job-training and encourage small businesses to hire more veterans. >From last year's enactment of the Veterans' Access to Care Through Choice, Accountability, & Transparency Act  to the more recent enactment of the Hire More Heroes Act  and the Clay Hunt SAV Act  , Congress has worked in a bipartisan capacity to make real differences in the lives of our Nation's heroes. While there is always more to be done-especially reforms to bring the VA into the 21st century-these actions collectively will help increase accountability at the Veterans Administration and help create more economic opportunities for our veterans. On behalf of my wife Heidi and me, we'd like to wish everyone a safe and happy Memorial Day.

,114,Female,N00026166,43423,"Foxx, Virginia (Rep.) [R-NC5]","Foxx Report for the Week of May 22, 2015 This week the House approved several pieces of legislation that would increase accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs. Americas veterans deserve better than the inexcusable mismanagement that weve seen over the last few years, and it is critically important that we provide high-quality, timely care for those who have sacrificed so much in service to our country. The legislation would also increase access to education programs for veterans and encourages small businesses to hire them. The entire nation owes our military personnel and veterans a huge debt of gratitude, and ensuring that debt is properly repaid is one of my top priorities in Congress. That is why I am hosting a veterans information session that will feature a number of veterans service organizations on Friday, June 19, in Clemmons. It is always an honor to assist veterans from the 5th District, and I want to make sure those in our community know about the benefits they qualify for and have an opportunity to provide feedback on the issues they face. Stop Human Trafficking On Tuesday the House passed S. 178, the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act, which includes many of the bipartisan measures that were passed by the House earlier this year to fight the growing problem of human trafficking in the United States. Human trafficking is modern day slavery that preys on vulnerable individuals, and this epidemic is not isolated to far-off places on the other side of the world. It is happening every day in the places we call home. This legislation will provide necessary support and services to the victims of trafficking crimes as well as boost resources for law enforcement. Unleashing American Ingenuity For over 30 years, companies large and small have taken advantage of the research and development tax credit to foster innovation and keep America competitive. However, the uncertainty surrounding the credits annual extension has ultimately restricted the amount of research and development that companies undertake. This week the House passed legislation to simplify the R&D tax credit and make it permanent. This would give businesses the certainty they need to make long-term investment decisions and keep North Carolina employers competitive in the global marketplace. Promoting Scientific Research and Innovation The House passed two bills this week that promote scientific research and innovation. H.R. 1806, the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2015, would reauthorize a number of federal scientific research programs and ensure that taxpayer funds are targeted at basic research, not the Obama administrations massive and unjustified climate change and green energy programs. H.R. 2262, the Spurring Private Aerospace Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship Act of 2015, would encourage growth in the developing commercial space industry by promoting private sector investment, creating more stable and predictable regulatory conditions and improving safety. Telephone Town Hall Dont forget to sign-up for the telephone town hall meeting on June 9th. You can register at Telephone town halls are one of the opportunities where the people I represent can share directly with me their concerns and ideas.

Since I took office in January, I've been busy meeting with constituents throughout the district and fighting for policies that support the Inland Empire's working families. Read My Plan to Put Inland Empire Residents Back to Work After marking one hundred days in office and embarking on a Jobs Tour of the Inland Empire, I unveiled my Jobs Plan; my strategy for kick-starting the Inland Empire economy and putting residents back to work. We have to start by: * Giving small businesses the tools they need to grow and expand * Creating 21st century jobs in renewable energy and biotechnology * Connecting people looking for work with employers and job training * Investing in our infrastructure to support business growth These action items alone won't solve the Inland Empire's financial challenges, but they will get us going down the right path. In order to truly improve our economy, we need to invest in the middle class. We can do this by: * Making college more affordable * Investing in early childhood education * Increasing the minimum wage * Ensuring pay equity for men and women * Enacting comprehensive immigration reform To learn more, read my full plan here  . You've read my plan, now see what I've done to turn my plan into action: Fighting for Students, Veterans, and Small Business Owners: * I co-sponsored a bill to restore access to full-year Pell Grants and help non-traditional and part-time students take summer and winter break classes. * I also co-sponsored a bill to establish a pilot State Manufacturing Employment Program to support training, apprenticeships, and certification classes for veterans. Read more here  . * I worked with Rep. Paul Cook (R, CA-08) to put local veterans back to work. Read more here  . * I voted to permanently extend three different tax provisions commonly used by many small businesses and I supported legislation that requires federal agencies to take into account the costs that small businesses may incur from new regulations. Read more here  . A Fair Shot for Working Families * I co-sponsored a bill to raise the federal minimum wage from $7.25 to $12.00 an hour by 2020, which would give hard-working families of the Inland Empire the tools they need to provide for their families and keep up with the increasing cost of living expenses. Read more here  . Working Across Party Lines for San Bernardino County Residents: * I worked with my Republican colleagues and co-sponsored a bill to repeal the medical device tax that would help Inland Empire manufacturers by alleviating them of a burdensome tax. * I also reached across the aisle to co-sponsor a bill that supports Inland Empire craft brewers by lowering the federal excise tax to level the playing field.

In the first four annual reports issued by The Government Accountability Office (GAO) from 2011 through 2014, 188 areas were identified where opportunities existed for executive branch agencies or Congress to reduce, eliminate, or better manage fragmentation, overlap, or duplication; achieve cost savings; or enhance revenue. Most recently, the GAOs 2015 Annual Report identified 12 new areas of fragmentation, overlap, or duplication in federal programs and activities. This year, a resolution has been introduced in the House of Representatives aimed at cutting down on duplicative, underutilized, and unnecessary government programs. H.RES.45 requires that, when Congress proposes the creation of a new program or initiative, lawmakers must justify to the American people why the program is necessary and how it adds value, ensuring that it's not duplicative to programs already in place. Congressman Randy Forbes is a cosponsor of this bill. Question of the Week: Do you support H.RES. 45 as a means of cutting down on duplicative government programs? ( ) Yes. ( ) No. ( ) I dont know.

,114,Male,N00009759,43336,"Larsen, Rick (Rep.) [D-WA2]","Dear Neighbors: One of my top priorities in Congress is to break down barriers for all people to participate in our economy and our democracy. This means making sure veterans have access to the education, job training, housing and health care they need. Given your interest in hearing from me about how I am supporting veterans, I want to share information about some of my recent efforts to help veterans access health care and permanent, affordable housing. Access to health care does not just mean having enough doctors. It means making sure veterans can get to appointments with their doctors. That is why I introduced the Rural Veterans Travel Enhancement Act of 2015 (H.R. 2291). The program that pays Department of Veterans Affairs employees to drive veterans to medical appointments will expire at the end of this year. This bill would reauthorize the Veterans Transportation Service program and provide mileage reimbursement for combat veterans traveling to receive counseling and care from Veterans Centers like those in Everett and Bellingham. My bill will help break down travel barriers so veterans do not have to wonder how they will get to their next health care appointment. You can find more information about the bill and the local groups that support it by visiting my website. Unfortunately many veterans struggle with homelessness, which is why I am a strong supporter of federal grants to provide veterans experiencing homelessness with permanent, affordable housing. Recently, I announced that about 35 veterans dealing with homelessness in Snohomish, Skagit and Island counties will receive vouchers to help with housing. These vouchers come on top of 187 already in place in Snohomish County, and 25 in place in Skagit County. These will be the first vouchers of this kind in Island County. The program also matches veterans with other support and services they may need. These grants will help more of our local veterans get permanent housing and on the path to independence. You can find more information about this grant program here. Let me know what you think and follow my efforts in Congress by visiting me on Facebook, Twitter and my website.

,114,Male,N00031377,43535,"Labrador, Raúl (Rep.) [R-ID1]","Congressman Raul Labrador, Representing the 1st District of Idaho Dear Friends, On Monday, I will be at the Idaho State Veterans Cemetery to help honor the brave Americans who made the ultimate sacrifice to our great country. Ive attended the Memorial Day ceremony each year since I took office in 2011. I consider it a solemn privilege to speak on behalf of everyone in the 1st Congressional District. Words, of course, fail at such moments. Even those as eloquent as President Ronald Reagan have recognized the difficulty. Said Reagan at Arlington National Cemetery in 1982: I have no illusions about what little I can add now to the silent testimony of those who gave their lives willingly for their country. Knowing we fall short, we will remember the mothers, fathers, sisters and brothers absent from the barbeques and picnics marking the start of summer. We will ponder the unimaginable courage of those who volunteer to put themselves in harms way. We will honor their memory by striving to keep America strong and free. And we will keep showing up, however feeble our words might be. Of all my daily duties as a member of Congress the most important is advocating for constituents, particularly veterans. Since taking office, my staff and I have helped obtain over $3 million owed to veterans and their families. I have had the honor of nominating young Idahoans to our military academies; watched service members swear to defend the Constitution against all enemies; presented long-delayed medals to deserving heroes; and attended funerals of the fallen. Those experiences reinforce my commitment to do everything possible to keep the nations promises to those who serve. As you enjoy your holiday weekend, please take a moment to reflect. Remember the sacrifice of those who make your leisure possible, who keep your family safe, and who remind us of the price of liberty. Happy Memorial Day.

Maybe youll get to spend a little extra time with your family and friends, and I hope you do. But, as we head into Memorial Day on Monday, its my hope that we can all take time to pause and reflect on what this holiday is all about. Its a chance to memorialize and remember the courageous men and women in uniform who paid the ultimate price for our freedoms. They are our friends, neighbors and family members who have fallen in service to our country.  Of course, there is nothing wrong with having fun. But, throughout the weekend, the sacrifices of all those who have served should never stray far from our thoughts. They are the reason we get to celebrate. Our brave U.S. Military men and women are serving here and across the worldsome putting their lives on the line every single day. And, they do it so we can be free. If you get a chance this weekend, please say thank you to a soldier. Our nation owes each of them a debt that can never be repaid, but we can certainly acknowledge and honor their sacrifices.

,114,Female,N00002858,43372,"Ros-Lehtinen, Ileana (Rep.) [R-FL27]","Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, United States Congresswoman - 27th District of Florida Dear Friends, Defending our nation is no easy task and it is one that inspires and merits our gratitude. As Americans, we are indebted to those who have fought and continue to serve to preserve our freedom and expand our countrys role as a champion of democracy around the world. As a Member of Congress, I have worked tirelessly to ensure that each and every service member in our armed forces is treated with the dignity and the respect they deserve. May is Military Appreciation Month and, while those who serve our country merit praise every day, this month offers each of us the unique opportunity to honor the service and sacrifice of the members of our armed forces. I am grateful that more than 61,000 active duty service members and 12,000 National Guard members live in Florida. Additionally, more than 1.5 million veterans have chosen to call our beautiful state their home. While we always count those who serve or served our nation as deserving of praise and gratitude, we must also remember that military families contributions through love, support, and time are also crucial to supporting our active duty service members and veterans. I am honored that my family includes veterans such as my husband, Dexter, who was wounded in combat during his voluntary service to our nation as an Army Ranger in Vietnam. My step-son, Douglas, and daughter-in-law, Lindsay, also served our nation honorably as marine aviators in Iraq. Lindsay also served in Afghanistan and both continue to defend our nation as marine reservists. As a Member of Congress, wife, and stepmother to veterans who have worked to secure our freedom, I know the extraordinary sacrifices that these heroes make. As a nation, we have a responsibility to ensure that those who have sacrificed in the service of democracy are able to lead successful and fulfilling lives when they return home. Having seen veterans educational needs first-hand, I was proud to work with Rep. Murphy (FL-18) to introduce the Reducing Barriers for Veterans Education Act. This bill would help veterans in our South Florida community and our nation by covering a portion of the costs associated with applying to institutions of higher education, such as college or graduate school. Education is of paramount importance and veterans should have every opportunity to attend the school of their choice. I also worked with my colleagues to ensure that the Hire More Heroes Act was the first bill passed this Congress. This bill would provide small businesses with an incentive to expand and hire those who have served our nation by allowing them to bypass burdensome healthcare regulations when hiring veterans. South Florida has served as home to many active duty members of our military, reservists, and veterans. Homestead Air Reserve Base is one of the crown jewels of our community. Oftentimes, our heroes need help with the bureaucratic maze that are our federal agencies. My office is always ready to assist our nations defenders with any federal issues they may have with agencies like the VA or the Social Security Administration. My Miami district office can be contacted at305-668-2285 [link 1]for help with any federal issue. For more help and detailed information about the ways that we can help, please visit[link 2]. My staff is prepared, ready and honored to help our nations heroes. Our nation was founded on the principle of freedom, which can only be passed on to the next generation through an involved citizenry that chooses to defend it. Our democracy would cease to exist without the brave men and women who have capably and proudly served our country both at home and abroad. I remain steadfast in my commitment to help our military, both during and following this service. This month, please take time to say thank you to the men and women in your life who have served or continue to serve and enable all of us to live in freedom. *Sincerely,* [image = *Ileana Ros-Lehtinen Member of Congress* *Don't forget to follow me on Twitter @RosLehtinen [link 3].

I'm here in Congress fighting for our values, our principles and our Kansas way of life. I'll continue updating you on what's going on in Washington on a weekly basis. * *Memorial Day is Monday!** Please read my editorial that will be in local papers across the Big First this weekend: On the fourth Monday of May each year, we remember and pray for the men and women who gave their lives to serve and protect our country and the freedoms we hold dear. But witheight uncles who served in the Armed Forces and as an active member of the House Veterans Affairs Committee, I know Memorial Day is more than just a time to remember. Those who made the ultimate sacrifice, and those who returned home, should not be forgotten on the other 364 days of the year. These heroes put their lives on the line, and we cant thank them enough. But we owe them more than gratitude  our Veterans deserve a Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that works for them. To read the rest of this piece, please clickhere [link 1]. * *Ditch the EPA** In case you missed it, here's the story on how I'm working hard to roll back the EPA's radical new plan to regulate all the waters of the United States: The number and cost of government regulations continued to climb in 2014, intensifying Washingtons control over Americans lives. The addition of 27 new major rules pushed the tally for the Obama Administrations first six years to 184, with scores of other rules in the pipeline. Adding in the maze of regulations for previous administrations, this red tape is costing Americans an estimated $2 trillion every year. And this Washington knows better than you do mentality is hurting us right here in Kansas. >From the Lesser Prairie Chicken to new restrictions on our community banks and credit unions that discourage home loans in our small towns, Washington continues to pile it on. Rather than focusing on legislation to promote Main Street, this Administration is drowning us in bureaucratic red tape.

While we enjoy the extra day off from work with family and an excuse to dust off the grill, I encourage my fellow Minnesotans to also take a moment to pause and reflect on the magnitude of this day-and the people it represents. Monday is a celebration of freedom, but also of the men and women who laid down their lives to make it possible. Conflicts may end, and time may pass. But the memory of our fallen will never be lost. Financial Services On Wednesday, I proudly-and officially-joined the House Committee on Financial Services.  Last week, the House Republican Steering Committee voted for me to join the committee to fill the vacancy left by Rep. Dold after his move to Ways and Means. I submitted waiver requests in hopes of continuing to serve on both of my former committees-Agriculture and Foreign Affairs. I am thrilled to have been appointed to the Financial Services Committee and look forward to get to work defending competition, consumer choice and our free market system. The financial industry is extremely prominent in the 6th District, with 146 banks, 8 credit unions and more than 57,000 of my constituents employed in finance related fields. I am looking forward to rolling up my sleeves to work on behalf of Minnesota's robust and thriving financial sector. Click here  to view my introduction to the committee. Foster Youth May was foster care month, when we recognize the impact of youth, parents, and advocates in the foster care system, and work together to address the shortcomings. My predecessor was actively involved in this issue while she was in office, having been a foster mother to 23 teenage girls. It's important work, and although I don't have the same personal involvement in this issue, I appreciate the opportunity to get involved.  Wednesday was Foster Youth Shadow Day, and I was privileged to spend my day with Maria from California. In and out of the system most of her life, she turned to schoolwork as her outlet. Now she is a biology student at Brown University. Next year she will be teaching math to under-served elementary students. I am so impressed by this young woman, and so thankful she shared her story with me. Next week my video will go further in depth on the foster care issue. In the meantime, click here  for more pictures from Maria's visit.

,114,Female,N00027860,43617,"Duckworth, Tammy (Rep.) [D-IL8]"," A Message From Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth     About Me  | Services  | Contact Me  Connect with Me     Rep. Tammy Duckworth meets with service members during her first term in office. Dear Neighbors, This weekend we take time to celebrate Memorial Day. It is a day dedicated to our loved ones who served our country and did not make it home. We can never fully repay the debt owed to the brave men and women who laid down their lives for our country, but we can honor their courage by upholding our duty to support our Veterans, members of the military and their families. To ensure our military families are cared for, I recently introduced The Military Spouses' Achieving College Education for Survivors (ACES) Act. By introducing this legislation we are ensuring that the promise we made to these important families is kept. The Fry Scholarship is an educational benefit given to children of our fallen troops. In August of 2014, Congress voted to extend this benefit to surviving spouses. Currently, public law cuts off Fry Scholarship Eligibility 15 years from the date of Service member's death. Unfortunately, this means that spouses who lost their loved one shortly after 9/11 only have a possible 12 or 24 months of eligibility to use an educational benefit that is good for 36 months of enrollment and is normally used over the course of 4 years. Additionally, surviving spouses using these educational benefits may only learn about this inadequacy once it is too late to select an alternative education benefit available to them. This is a disservice to our Veterans and their loved ones. The ACES act will allow surviving spouses whose eligibility will cease before the full use of their benefit under the Fry Scholarship to complete their education and never have to worry about losing the benefit halfway through their educational pursuits. They should not suffer simply because their hero was among the first to lay down their life for our nation after 9/11. How a nation treats military families after they have made the ultimate sacrifice is the true measure of all of us. Whether it's healthcare, education or employment, we have a covenant to keep with our Veterans. I hope you will join me in supporting this crucial piece of legislation.

America is a stronger country because of our Armed Service members. The 21st Congressional District is home to over 60,000 veterans, current members of the military and their families. Memorial Day is a testament of our country's commitment to our service members, past and present, who risked all to defend our nation's freedom. The debt we owe them can never fully be repaid. We thank each of our veterans and their families for helping our country be the land of the free and the home of the brave. I'd also like to give a special thanks to the many men and women of the 21st District of Texas who have selflessly served our nation. Your service and sacrifice have helped keep our nation safe and our citizens secure. And for that we are most grateful. I am also honored to have worked with VFW Post 688 in Boerne to give Vietnam era Medal of Honor recipient Milton A. Lee the long overdue recognition he deserves. This week I was able to introduce legislation that would rename a stretch of highway along I-10 in his honor, with signatures from each member of the Texas congressional delegation in time for Memorial Day.

Veterans History Project  This Memorial Day and every other day of the year, I honor the memory of all the men and women who made the ultimate sacrifice and gave their lives while serving in the United States Military. Now is the perfect opportunity to record the story of the veteran in your family or community, or help compile the first person narrative of a deceased loved one who served, and donate it to the Veterans History Project at the Library of Congress. Family members of deceased veterans may submit veterans' original photographs, letters, diaries and other written materials to this national preservation effort. Afterward, each veteran will have his or own web page on the Veterans History Project website. Instructions may be found by visiting my website. Veterans Deserve Timely Care Last July, Congress passed legislation to improve access to care for veterans and accountability at the Department of Veterans Affairs. In November, the new law went into effect. But I am concerned by reports that show veterans continue to experience delays. Veterans should never have to wait longer than 30 days for a medical appointment, and those living more than 40 miles from a VA facility should be allowed to seek private care at the expense of the VA. In some cases, the VA has denied private care to veterans because they lived within 40 miles of a VA facility, even though those facilities do not provide the type of specialized care the veteran requires. I have cosponsored legislation to continue pushing the VA to provide access to specialized care these veterans were promised under the new law. My office is always available to assist veterans with VA benefits and services and I strongly encourage any veterans who have waited more than 30 days for an appointment to contact my office. Veterans deserve the best health care, not delayed health care.

,114,Male,N00026790,43420,"Cleaver, Emanuel (Rep.) [D-MO5]","A little over a month ago, I admit, I was angry. Now, I am just plain fed up. I am frustrated. Once again, Congress has failed to find solutions to the urgent business facing our country, threatening hundreds of thousands of jobs and prolonging uncertainty for communities across America. This week, Congress voted on a bill to patch the Highway Trust Fund. The fund was set to expire at the end of May, just a few days from now. Instead of taking up a proper transportation bill, we have taken the easy route. We have found a simple shortcut to avoid the work the American people sent us here to complete. We punted on this deadline. As I shared with you a few weeks ago, we have already patched the Highway Trust Fund thirty-two times in the past six years. Now the count is at thirty-three. This is, frankly, a perennial problem for policymakers. And yet, this is a problem we can, together, fix. The bill passed, extending the patch until two months deeper into the critical summer construction season. I did not support it. In fact, I felt I could not do so. We are governing  if you can call it that at all  by extension. Instead of legislating, we are merely putting a Band-Aid on our considerable wounds. Instead of crafting policy, we are kicking the can down the road. In spite of this looming deadline, my colleagues in the House and Senate have yet to put forward a plan to reauthorize the Trust Fund. Instead of working and taking action, Republicans have ignored the need for a long-term surface transportation bill for ten months  since the last short-term extension was passed  perpetuating perilous uncertainty and preventing states from being able to plan and budget effectively. Now, with the Highway Trust Fund set to expire in the middle of construction season, jobs across the country are being put at risk. And again, come July, we will be right back where we started. The easiest way to maintain and improve our transportation systems would be to raise the federal gas tax, which has not been increased since 1993. Simply by raising it and indexing it to inflation, we could secure the future of the transportation bill. I have cosponsored a bill that would fix this problem. Our nation is steadfastly stuck in small, short-term patches that fail to meet the challenge of our nations crumbling roads and bridges  even as other nations advance their infrastructure by leaps and bounds. It is long past time for a long-term reauthorization of the Highway Trust Fund that will bring our roads, rails and bridges into the 21st century. According to the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials: 660,000 good paying construction jobs are hanging in the balance; This needless crisis is casting uncertainty on 6,000 critical construction projects across the country. Heres a breakdown of what this latest manufactured crisis means for American families and businesses: Aging Infrastructure in Need of Repair 54% of our major roads are rated poor or mediocre. One out of every four bridges  more than 147,000 bridges  in the United States is structurally deficient or functionally obsolete. The average age of our nations bridges is 42. 45% of Americans dont have access to transit. Federal land management agencies need over $11 billion to address deferred maintenance needs on our roads and bridges. The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) estimates that the cost of upgrading and repairing our deteriorating bridges is $106 billion. The American Society of Civil Engineers gave U.S. infrastructure an overall grade of D-. Consequences of Congestion According to the 2013 ASCE report, 42% of Americas major urban highways remain congested. Congestion costs commuters $121 billion in wasted time and fuel, or an average of $818 per commuter. In 2011, congestion caused urban Americans to travel 5.5 billion hours more and to purchase an extra 2.9 billion gallons of fuel. With the clock ticking, it is time for Republicans to work with Democrats to meet our nations surface transportation needs and address the infrastructure backlog. If Republicans fail to act, it will deprive state transportation departments of their expected funding stream that enable them to plan ahead for highway, transit, and pedestrian projects that grow our economy, provide well-paying jobs for hardworking Americans, and encourage more businesses to invest here at home.

Babies feel pain at the five month mark and medical developments are moving up the point of viability. The United States is one of only seven nations on Earth that allow elective abortions five months into the pregnancy. As science advances, we are living in an age of life. Recent polling shows that 60% of the public supports H.R. 35. I have a 100% pro-life record and will continue to be one of the leading champions and advocates for life in the entire Congress.

QUESTIONING THE CONNECTION BETWEEN EMISSIONS AND EXTREME WEATHER* - In theHouse Natural Resources Committee, Congressman Doug Lamborn engaged in a fascinating dialogue withMr. John Christy Professor of Atmospheric Science and State Climatologist National Space Science and Technology Center, University of Alabama. During their exchange, Professor Christy categorized the impact that a single project (such as a coal-fired power plant) would have on the climate of the planet would be, ""like spitting in the ocean."" The professor also pointed out that real world atmospheric climate data collected by balloons and satellites over the last three decades has not matched up with the predictions laid out by the last three decades of climate modelling.We must always strive to be good stewards of our environment. However, we must not cripple our economy and potential for growth and development with hugely expensive costs based on assertions that are being disputed and questioned within the scientific community. I commend Professor Christy for his courage in speaking up on this very important issue. *Please click HERE [link 5]to watch the dialogue* [image =    *KEEPING TABS ON IRAN* - I supportedH.R. 1191, theIran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015. This bill requires a review by the House and Senate of any nuclear agreement with Iran before President Obama can waive or suspend sanctions previously imposed by Congress.President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry have stumbled through months of negotiations that don't appear to have limited Iran's march toward a nuclear weapon. By mandating Congressional oversight and involvement, H.R. 1191 ensures that this nuclear deal will receive the closest possible scrutiny and will open the door to a more active participatory role for the Congress. Although is only a baby step in the right direction, it does make some progress that is worth supporting. When we are dealing with something that could fundamentally change the balance of power in the Middle East, we cannot afford to rush through any agreement without proper Congressional oversight and due diligence. Passage of this legislation is a major victory for the American people and for the safety and security of this nation and our allies, but it is only the first step. If a deal is reached Congress must work together to insure that it is in fact a good deal. And, if not, Congress must do its role and disapprove of such a deal. *More Information (courtesy of the House Republican Conference)* Major provisions of the bill include: Congressional Review:Requires the President to submit to Congress, within five days of concluding a comprehensive agreement with Iran: (1) the text of the agreement and all related materials; (2) a verification assessment on Iranian compliance; and (3) a certification that the agreement meets U.S. non-proliferation objectives and does not jeopardize U.S. national security, including not allowing Iran to pursue nuclear-related military activities. No Suspension of Congressional Sanctions during Review Period:Prohibits the President from waiving statutory sanctions while Congress reviews the agreement. If the agreement and all related documents are submitted prior to July 10, 2015, Congress has up to 52 days to review the deal and may vote on the agreement in the first 30 days; the President then has 12 days to veto the bill, followed by 10 days for Congress to override such a veto. If the deal is submitted between July 10 and September 7, 2015, Congress has an additional 30 days of review, for a total of up to 82 days. Joint Resolution of Disapproval:Gives Congress the opportunity to enact a joint resolution of disapproval (over a presidential veto) within the review period. Enactment of a joint resolution of disapproval would prevent the President from waiving or suspending the Congressional sanctions. Oversight and Compliance:Requires the President to certify to Congress every 90 days that Iran is complying with the agreement. If Iran violates the terms of the deal, the legislation provides an expedited process for Congress to rapidly restore sanctions. Reporting:Includes new reporting requirements on Irans direct and indirect support for terrorism, human rights violations, and ballistic missile testing.  *ADVOCATING FOR MISSILE DEFENSE* - I delivereda keynote address at the 13th Annual Ronald Reagan Missile Defense Forum. [image = [image = *Text of Speech* Good morning. Thank you first and foremost to Admiral Syring for the invitation to speak this morning. As you all know, Admiral Syring is a huge asset for the Missile Defense Agency. His leadership has been vital as the MDA has faced challenging budget environments. Admiral Syring is very well respected on Capitol Hill and I am grateful for all the time he has given me, both here in Washington and at the Missile Defense Integration and Operations Center, or MDIOC, in my district just outside Colorado Springs. Speaking of Colorado Springs, Im sure there are a few folks in industry and government here today from Colorado Springs. Im extremely proud of the contribution that my constituents make to missile defense system, which is part of why I co-chair the Missile Defense Caucus. In fact, just three weeks ago, we hosted a number of industry partners for the second Missile Defense Day on the Hill. Unfortunately, the Speaker cut votes short for the week, so we didnt get as many members of Congress as last time, but it was still a great day. And thank you Admiral Syring for letting General Todorov come to that event. His participation was a great addition. Were obviously here today to talk about the importance of missile defense. Or more specifically, the importance of a strong and reliable missile defense system. The fact that we can hit a bullet with a bullet is stunning, but it doesnt do much good if it isnt a part of a system that provides reliable protection to the homeland. The good news is that we have a reliable system today and each day it is getting more reliable, thanks to the work of many of you in this room. In addition to protecting American citizens 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, this missile defense system actually changes how our potential adversaries think -- and in a good way. A credible missile defense system reduces the value of long-range ballistic missiles to rogue regimes. And most importantly it prevents America from ever being held hostage by threats from rogue regimes. Missile defense actually changes the strategic environment for the better. Now missile defense has not always been a bipartisan issue. As many of you well know, there have been critics of missile defense for decades, but there is now strong bipartisan support in Congress for missile defense. Yes, there are still occasional detractors and yes, there are still some areas of missile defense where partisan lines emerge, but by and large there is consensus that missile defense is important. Part of this consensus is that missile defense has proven itself. The most high profile example is obviously Iron Dome. And while that is different in many important ways from what you all spend most of your time working on, I think it unmistakably showed the real-world value of missile defenses. If you can shoot down a rocket or a missile headed for your country, your political leaders have more space to make decisions in responding to the attack. But Im preaching to the choir on this, so let me move on. Let me offer a few ideas of where I think we need to take our missile defense system. First, we need to continue investing in our current system to make sure it is robust and reliable. Just a few miles from my house is NORTHCOM. Admiral Gortney and his team, through the Colorado National Guardsmen at the 100th Missile Defense Brigade--they are the warfighters. They need a robust and reliable system that is ready to go on a moments notice. We must continue improving our ground-based interceptors. I am glad to see the CE2 interceptors being deployed, and Im glad that our plans to put more GBIs in the ground in Alaska seem to be on track. We also need to ensure that the backbone of BMDS is strong and secure. The sensors and command & control architecture needs to provide warfighters and decision makers with what they need quickly and reliably. To ensure all of this, I believe that we need more testing. We need more ground testing, we need more flight testing, we need more exercising, and so on. I know this costs money, but testing is critical if we want to have a reliable system. Second, we need to improve our sensor architecture. Our interceptors are only as good as the sensors that guide them. The Long Range Discriminating Radar (or LRDR) in Alaska will play a key part in this. I know that Admiral Syring and Admiral Gortney are talking about the best place to put this radar, and I am very supportive of this going forward. But we also need to look at other sensors as well, and we need to make sure that we can use existing sensor data well. This leads me to my third area where we need to invest--space. I believe that space-based sensors, and perhaps more than sensors in the future, are key to the future of missile defense. We obviously already rely on space for missile warning, but we should do more. The Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS) demonstration has proven itself to be very effective. If you arent familiar with what theyve been able to do with just two satellites, you should go learn about it. It is clear that some sort of space sensor layer could provide critical track and discrimination ability. In fact, the National Defense Authorization Act that will be on the floor of the House later today, includes a provision I added encouraging the MDA to move forward on developing a space sensor architecture. As you may know, the MDA actually has a very exciting space program underway right now that has a great acronym: SKA. Its the Space-based Kill Assessment. I cant say too much about it in this venue, except that the team at MDAs space unit are doing great work, and may actually be showing the rest of the DOD how to think creatively and affordably about space systems. The fourth area is kind of an obvious catchall, but must be discussed. We need to continue to invest in advanced technologies. We can hit a bullet with a bullet, but we cant be content there. We need to bend the cost curve, and we need to change when and where we can intercept missiles. I also happen to co-chair the Directed Energy Caucus, and I think directed energy is crucial to the future of missile defense. MDA has some directed energy work currently, and more proposed in FY16, but myself and others in Congress believe we must prioritize our investments in directed energy if we want to stay ahead of the competition and bend the cost curve. Directed energy can be used as a sensor, but also hopefully, eventually, as a means of intercept. Other emerging technologies also need to be invested in, such as railgun. Underlying all of these areas of focus is one obvious need: increased funding. The increases this year for ground-based missile defense are good, but far from sufficient. The Budget Control Act is partly to blame, as it imposed the spending caps and sequestration. I voted against that deal and I am actively advocating in Congress to get rid of it. But this is only one part of the missile defense funding challenge. The other part, frankly, seems to be the priorities of this administration. This administration has been consistently whittling away at the missile defense budget. After then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel announced the increased number of GBIs in Alaska, the next budget request actually was lower for missile defense. The pace and seriousness of the threat seems to have brought increased policy support for missile defense, but the funding is still below what it ought to be. This year the Presidents budget request went up by roughly $600 million, but it is still $1.2 billion below the last year of the Bush Administration. And the out-years for this years budget request would cut missile defense funding to a record low even for this administration. So, Im obviously concerned about missile defense funding. Yes, we need to address the budget caps and sequestration, but this is primarily a question of priority of this administration. We are entering a new missile age and robust missile defenses are a must. Missile defense is vitally important and is a mission that cannot fail. I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress to promote a strong level of funding for missile defense and I hope that the administration will promote a strong funding level for missile defense as well.   *SETTING THE STAGE FOR A LONG-TERM INFRASTRUCTURE SOLUTION* - I supported H.R. 2352, theHighway and Transportation Funding Act of 2015. This bill extends the Highway Trust Fund through July 31, 2015 allowing projects around the country to continue uninterrupted while Congress finalizes a long-term and fiscally sustainable solution to our infrastructure needs. I will not support a mechanism that raises taxes to achieve this goal. Many intriguing conservative possibilities exist and I look forward to this debate.  *KEEPING AMERICA COMPETITIVE IN STEM AREAS* - It is very important for the future of America that we remain competitive and one of the world leaders in the fields of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics (STEM). That's why I support H.R. 1806, the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act and H.R. 880, the American Research and Competitiveness Act. H.R. 1806 will prioritize funding for research that ensures future U.S. competitiveness and spurs innovation in the private technology sector. H.R. 880 will simplify research and development tax credits providing certainty for businesses, allowing them to invest, innovate, and create more jobs here in America. [image = COMPETES Act A.jpg]  - Additionally, I supported H.R. 2262, the Spurring Private Aerospace Competitiveness and Entrepreneurship (SPACE) Act. This bill is geared towards implementing a pro-growth environment in which the commercial space industry will be allowed to grow and invest this next phase of the final frontier. *Interesting Articles and Recommended Reading* The Hill Op-Ed: Time to get serious about space threats [link 6]byCongressman Doug Lamborn Illinois passes historic anti-BDS bill, as Congress mulls similar moves [link 7]byThe Washington Post **article features Congressman Lamborn** The mystery behind the Air Forces classified space plane [link 8]byThe Washington Post **article features Congressman Lamborn** House defies Obama veto threat, approves $612B defense bill [link 9]byThe Hill **article features Congressman Lamborn** When did America forget that it's America?

,114,Male,N00030026,43483,"Luetkemeyer, Blaine (Rep.) [R-MO3]","There is no doubt that Memorial Day exists because the American spirit exists. With that in mind, there is one story in mind that truly embodies the American spirit and persistence. Five years ago, I was approached by a constituent in my Washington, Mo. office wanting to tell her fathers story about his time defending our great nation in World War I. Her father, Sergeant William Shemin was in the 4th Infantry Division in the United States Army. And she believed that her father should be awarded the Medal of Honor for his actions in France in August, 1918. Sgt. Shemin selflessly exposed himself to enemy fire to rescue wounded troops and after all of his superior officers were either wounded or killed, he took command of his platoon and led it to safety, before he, himself, was wounded by a machine gun bullet. As Sgt. Shemins daughter, Elsie, told the story of incredible bravery, I could visibly see how passionate she was about ensuring her father received, posthumously, the Medal of Honor. And while Sgt. Shemin was awarded the Distinguished Service Cross, there was never any explanation why he didnt receive the Medal of Honor  and I was determined to join her in this cause and see it through to the end. As many of you know, the Medal of Honor is our countrys highest military honor and it is not awarded frequently. In fact, it requires an exhaustive review and approval process. Per the United States Army, Medals of Honor are bestowed only to the bravest of the brave; and that courage must be well documented. As a result of the irrefutable documentation that is required, it is even rarer for the Medal of Honor to be posthumously awarded for acts of valor that took place nearly 100 years ago, because the military is not able to review Medal of Honor cases dating that far back without approval from Congress. However, after working to secure passage of legislation to allow for the review of Sgt. Shemins case, and receiving favorable recommendations from the Army and Pentagon, I can now proudly state that the President of the United States will award Sgt. Shemin with the Medal of Honor on June 2nd, 2015, just shy of 97 years since that fateful day in France. While Sgt. Shemin was not able to receive this award during his lifetime, I take comfort in the knowledge that his daughter, Elsie, will be able to accept the Medal of Honor on his behalf and that we, as a country, can celebrate Sgt. Shemins lasting legacy. While stories like Sgt. Shemins are truly inspirational, we shouldnt lose sight of the recognition that all of our countrys servicemembers and veterans deserve. There are men and women both out on the front lines and in supporting roles who we should give thanks to each and every day. It is because of them that we are able to enjoy the freedoms that we cherish so much. Memorial Day is a time to remember all of our veterans and servicemembers who stood fearlessly in defense of our nation. It is a day that serves as a reminder to remember what was lost and what was saved. I cannot wait to welcome Sgt. Shemins daughter to the nations capital and to see her finally hold her fathers Medal of Honor, which is truly a dream come true for her.

[R-PA6]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email  News from Representative Ryan Costello  Thank you for reading my weekly e-newsletter. As we head into Memorial Day weekend, I wanted to take the opportunity to thank all of our veterans for their service and express our eternal gratitude for those who give the ultimate sacrifice in the line of duty. A legislative update from the past week is below. I hope you and your family are able to enjoy the long weekend! Honoring our Veterans: May 18-22, 2015 May is recognized as Military Appreciation Month, and on Monday I was pleased that the House passed six bills aimed at helping our veterans and bringing accountability to the VA. To start, I am especially proud to say that the first bill I introduced in Congress, a commonsense piece of legislation to bring greater accountability to the VA, unanimously passed the full House of Representatives on May 18th. H.R. 1038: the Ensuring VA Accountability Act  , would require specific disciplinary actions to remain in an employees record while employed at the VAcurrent policy allows for certain records to be deleted after two or three years. I believe it is critical to maintain a complete record of a poor performer in order to better understand an employee as long as they are with the Department. It is my hope that the Senate will take up this legislation without delay and send it to the Presidents desk for his signature. You can read a recap of my bill here  . In addition to H.R. 1038, the House passed the following veterans-related bills. These are just initial steps to support our veterans and their families and ensure they receive the care they deserve. * H.R. 474: Homeless Veterans Reintegration Programs Reauthorization Act of 2015  , reauthorizes this important program to assist veterans in achieving meaningful employment. I cosponsored this legislation. * H.R. 1313: Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Relief Act  , provides assistance to a surviving spouse of a veteran to retain the veterans small business status for up to 10 years following death. * H.R. 1382: Boosting Rates of American Veteran Employment Act  , allows the VA to give preference to government contractors that employ veterans on a full-time basis. * H.R. 91: Veterans ID Card Act  , allows all veterans to receive official identification cards through the VA. I cosponsored this legislation. I cosponsored this legislation. * H.R. 1816: Vulnerable Veterans Housing Reform Act of 2015  , amends the U.S. Housing Act of 1937 that limits housing benefits for low-income, disabled veterans. STATUS UPDATE: Combatting Human Trafficking Earlier this year, I reported on a number of bills passed by the House of Representatives aimed at combatting human trafficking and assisting the victims with much needed support. On Tuesday, the legislative process continued when the House passed the Senates amendments to this package, S. 178: the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act  . I am pleased that this legislation will finally reach the Presidents desk. In March, I hosted a human trafficking forum at Penn States Great Valley campus that brought together key experts from the U.S. Department of Homeland Security (DHS), regional law enforcement, and social services agencies in an effort to educate and combat this heinous crime. You can read the Unionville Times recap of this event here.  Promoting Innovation and Strengthening Scientific Enterprise This week, the House of Representatives examined legislation that encourages the American innovative spirit. These bills were focused on fostering science and research innovation and promoting certainty and growth within these fields. A recap of legislation that we passed: * H.R. 880: American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015  , I was proud to cosponsor this legislation that passed the House with bipartisan support, 274-145. This legislation makes permanent the research and development (R&D) tax credit. Since 1981, the R&D tax credit has been a temporary measure, even expiring in some years. By making permanent the R&D tax credit, we will provide greater certainty to innovators and businesses investing in research and development and promoting innovation. America's greatest asset is our spirit of innovation, and this legislation encourages that spirit to thrive. * H.R. 1806: the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act  passed the House on Wednesday by a vote of 217-205. This comprehensive bill promotes fiscal responsibility in our science and research investments. This legislation is critical to maintaining Americas position as a global leader in research and strengthening American scientific enterprise. * H.R. 2262: SPACE Act of 2015  , passed the House on Thursday, by a vote of 284-133. This legislation frees the commercial space industry from burdensome regulations and facilitates a pro-growth environment. The House also passed multiple bipartisan Science, Space, and Technology Committee bills aimed at reducing regulations and promoting innovation in the research and science fields. Below is a rundown of the bills that were passed unanimously by voice vote: * H.R. 874: American Super Computing Leadership Act  , amends previous legislation to require the Secretary of Energy to encourage research, partnerships, reports and the development of technologies in an effort to develop a supercomputer system. * H.R. 1162: Science Prize Competitions Act  , amends previous legislation to clarify that Federal agencies can partner with private sector entities to hold prize competitions to incentivize scientific and technological research. * H.R. 1119: Research and Development Efficiency Act  , requires federal research regulations to be reviewed for unjustified burdens, unnecessary requirements and duplication in an effort to promote cost savings. * H.R. 1156: International Science and Technology Cooperation Act of 2015  , authorizes the establishment of a body to identify and coordinate international science and technology cooperation opportunities. Practicing What We Preach: Promoting Fiscal Responsibility in the House Finally, the House passed H.R. 2250: FY 2016 Legislative Branch Appropriations Act  . This Appropriations bill wisely funds the Legislative Branch for Fiscal Year 2016. It trims unnecessary costs and smartly spends your taxpayer dollars. It also ensures that the Capitol Police are equipped to protect our nations capital. Here are a few highlights: * Holds the line on House funding to save taxpayers $782 million  a nearly 14 percent reduction in House spending under the Republican majority. * Continues the pay freeze for Members of Congress that has been in place since 2010. * Increases funding for the Capitol Police by $21 million, boosting critical safety and security functions, and maintaining public access to the Capitol. * Protects funding for the Government Accountability Office, which provides critical oversight for the American people.

[R-TN6]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email    Contact Me  | Serving You  | Media Center  | Legislative Work  | Our District  | Resources  This Memorial Day, We've Got to Do Better Dear Friends, This weekend, many families across middle Tennessee will mark the Memorial Day holiday with a day off from work - perhaps spent at a patriotic parade or a picnic with family and friends. But no matter where we are, we will all be enjoying the blessings of liberty thanks to the brave men and women who fought to keep us safe. On Memorial Day, we pay special tribute to those who made the ultimate sacrifice in defense of our nation, but it is critical to remember that every American who has worn the uniform of our country makes sacrifices of time, energy, and personal safety to protect the freedoms we hold dear. Unfortunately, while our nation's veterans have always looked out for us - our government has not consistently responded in kind. Last year, we learned that 40 veterans reportedly died  at a Veterans Administration (VA) facility in Arizona because they did not receive timely care. Similarly, 110 VA facilities around the country were found to have hidden lists of veterans waiting for treatment. Recently, the problems at the VA hit close to home when many of you contacted my office about the poor quality of care at the Alvin C. York VA facility in Murfreesboro. We already knew that middle Tennessee VA hospitals racked up some of the longest wait times  in the nation. Now, multiple sources have revealed to my office that the Murfreesboro facility is not admitting new hospital patients, instead referring them to Nashville. These accounts further claim that the emergency room is closed and now functions as an urgent care center that closes at 8:00 PM daily, and was once left without a physician to staff the premises. To make matters worse, the hospital's intern arrangement with a local university was reportedly not renewed - leaving the hospital without the support staff necessary to provide efficient, quality care. We cannot waste any time getting answers about this crisis and holding responsible parties accountable. That is why I went straight to the top; sending a letter  to VA Secretary Robert McDonald to request a federal, independent investigation of the Murfreesboro VA hospital. Congress has fully funded the VA every year that I have served in Washington, so there is no excuse for the poor quality of care that our veterans are receiving. The agency was exempted from the automatic spending cuts in the President's sequester and has seen its budget increase year after year in an environment where other departments saw their frozen or scaled back. Most recently, the House voted with my support earlier this month to increase VA funding yet again by 5.6 percent over last year's levels. The VA does not have a problem with its balance sheet, it has a problem with the overall culture of the agency - and it is a crisis that must be fixed from the inside out. This Memorial Day, we've got to do better. As the wife, mother, and daughter of veterans I know firsthand that these brave Americans give our country their very best, and they deserve the same in return. We need a plan from this President to fundamentally reform and reimagine the way that the VA delivers care to our nation's heroes and, in the meantime, we need answers and accountability from our local VA here at home. After everything our veterans have done for us, isn't this the least we can do for them? Sincerely,  Diane Black Member of Congress Follow me on...       in the news    Rep.

[R-VA1]","Over the years, decades, and centuries of American existence, our peace and prosperity  and our future  have always rested on the shoulders of the servicemen and women who are willing to sacrifice so much for the cause of liberty. From General Cornwallis surrender at Yorktown, signifying the end of the Revolutionary War, to the present day War on Terror, these individuals have selflessly fought for freedom on behalf of their fellow countrymen. This May, we recognize Military Appreciation Month, and I hope that all of you will take an opportunity to thank our men and women in uniform and support them in any way you can. We have survived and prospered for more than 200 years because they have made it their duty to defend our liberty. Remembering and acknowledging the debt we owe to them is the least we can do. This and every month, let's say ""thank you"" to our service members. Congress plays an intrinsic role in supporting our Soldiers, Sailors, Airmen, Marines and Coast Guardsmen each and every day. I believe we have a constitutional duty to ensure they are effectively resourced. As Chairman of the House Armed Services Readiness Subcommittee, I remain committed to doing everything I can to ensure that the policies coming out of Washington ensure our military has the training, resources, and equipment needed to accomplish its missions. I also believe that we must support them when they return home, which is why I have supported measures aimed at restoring accountability at the VA and ensuring veterans timely access to quality health care, as well as providing greater stability for military families. The First District is home to a significant number of active duty service members and veterans, and I am humbled to serve them. Recently, I was proud to recognize another group of individuals whose selflessness is instrumental in the important work of this nation: our federal workforce. I introduced a resolution this month to express support for our public servants and to commend them for their dedication and continued service to the U.S. during Public Service Recognition Week. This week of appreciation served as a great opportunity to thank our dedicated federal employees, both past and present, for their devoted efforts on behalf of the citizens of the United States. From the CIA agents and Defense Department civilians who complement the work of our military, to the Border Control agents fighting illegal immigration, human trafficking, and drug-running operations, our federal workforce is full of individuals who value service above self. Without them, this nation would not be what it is today, and I thank them for their service. The main streets of Virginias First District are full of ideas to get our economy back on track, and your feedback is critically important to me as I serve you.

Memorial Day is a time for Americans to come together to thank our dedicated soldiers scattered across the globe, the wounded warriors whose lives have been forever changed by their experience of war and those who did not return. In my work on the Armed Services Committee, I have made it a priority to support our servicemembers and their families. One area on which I have focused since being elected has been on ways we can support women servicemembers. For example, the recently-passed House version of the annual defense bill included a provision I authored that requires the Army to create a policy regarding workplace breastfeeding for servicewomen, something I heard was a problem firsthand from Army Moms. Read more about it in this weeks eNewsletter. Another bill recently passed by the House of Representatives was the Medicare Access and CHIP Reauthorization Act, which also included language I authored. The bill funds teaching health centers, something I championed and worked across the aisle to ensure had appropriate support. This bill also community health centers and restructured the method by which doctors are reimbursed by Medicare so that seniors wouldnt lose access to their doctors. Also in this weeks newsletter, read the Lowell Suns Editorial supporting a bill I introduced, Merrimack Valley Magazines article about the Lawrence Partnership, and read about how my office helped the Greater Lawrence Family Health Center receive a grant valued at nearly 3 million dollars.

When Boston Magazine used those words in a headline over a less than flattering 2012 story about Lawrence, a metaphorical gauntlet was thrown. And the response has been impressive. Rather than helplessly shrugging their shoulders, many people inspired by this storied city chose instead to link arms and accept the challenge to turn things around.READ FULL STORY HERE  Greater Lawrence Family Health Center awarded HHS grant for nearly $3 million WASHINGTON, DC  May 13, 2015 The Greater Lawrence Family Health Center (GLFHC) has been awarded a grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) totaling $2,918,871.00.

As always, let us know if you have any questions, comments or concerns. Office contact information is provided at the end of this e-mail. This is an unattended mailbox. Please do not reply directly to this e-mail. Instead, if you wish to e-mail us, please use the Write Your Rep account at May 22, 2015 Black Box Legislation This week I filed the Black Box Privacy Protection Act with Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner (R-WI) to give vehicle owners more control over the information collected through their car or motorcycles ""black box"" event data recorder (EDR). The legislation requires manufacturers to notify consumers if an event data recorder is installed in their vehicle, disclose the data collection capabilities, and provide information on how data collected may be used. The bill places ownership of the data in the hands of the vehicle owner and requires the owners permission before the information can be accessed. The legislation also requires manufacturers to give consumers the option of controlling the recording function in future automobiles or motorcycles that are equipped with event data recorders. Event data recorders, or ""black boxes,"" are installed in vehicles to collect information leading up to an accident. They record factors such as speed and brake application. Many consumers are not aware that this data has the potential of being used against them in civil or criminal proceedings, or by their insurer to increase rates. No federal law exists to clarify the rights of a vehicle owner with respect to this recorded data. Under this legislation, all data collected by an EDR would become the property of the vehicle owner. The bill would make it illegal for anyone other than the vehicle owner to download or retrieve information without owner consent or a court order. It also requires all new cars equipped with EDRs to have an option allowing the owner to control the recording function that cannot be restarted without the owners consent. For me this is a basic issue of privacy. Consumers should have control of the information collected in their own vehicles. Transportation On Tuesday the House considered H.R. 2353, a two month Highway Trust Fund extension. The authorization for transportation funding expires at the end of May and H.R. 2353 extends it until July 31st. I supported this legislation so states and municipalities will continue having access to transportation dollars. I am deeply disappointed however, that an extension is once again necessary. Historically, reauthorizing transportation funding has been bipartisan and long term. Every state has infrastructure requiring repair and worthwhile transportation projects in need of federal funding. Transportation spending is also good for the economy because it creates jobs. Yet, time and time again, Republican leadership has settled on a short term extension rather than focus on how to advance legislation that will fund multiple years. Longer agreements give states a measure of certainty over how much money they can expect to receive from the federal government and the ability to set long-term priorities. I hope this is the last extension, and the House can complete work on a multiyear agreement this summer. I voted YES. H.R. 2353 passed and the entire vote is recorded below: YEA NAY PRESENT NOT VOTING REPUBLICAN 228 12 1 3 DEMOCRAT 159 23 0 6 TOTAL 387 35 1 9 MASSACHUSETTS 7 1 0 1 Appropriations On Tuesday the House also considered H.R. 2250, Legislative Branch Appropriations.

This legislation updates and makes permanent the research and development tax credit. While I am concerned that the cost of the tax credit is not offset, it will create jobs and help to encourage additional investment in research. A permanent extension offers a degree of certainty to businesses that often plan their research projects far in advance. They must take into account the time involved with building facilities, conducting experiments and carrying out trials. Federal funding for research and development has declined over the years and making this tax credit permanent is one way to support it. I voted YES. H.R. 880 passed and the entire vote is recorded below: YEA NAY PRESENT NOT VOTING REPUBLICAN 237 1 0 6 DEMOCRAT 37 144 0 7 TOTAL 274 145 0 13 MASSACHUSETTS 6 2 0 1 Science Also on Wednesday the House considered H.R. 1806, the America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2015. This legislation authorizes the federal governments research and Science, Technology, Engineering and Math (STEM) education programs. Past reauthorizations have enjoyed strong bipartisan support. Unfortunately, H.R. 1806 does little to encourage scientific innovation. Instead, it contains steep funding cuts to a whole host of Department of Energy (DOE) and National Science Foundation (NSF) programs, including those focusing on energy efficiency, renewable energy, social, behavioral, and economic sciences research, and geosciences. This would be the first time Congress imposes specific funding allocations on individual research disciplines, effectively deciding which initiatives are more important than others. I believe these determinations are best left to the NSF. The bill also includes a provision blocking the government from using DOEs own research on fossil fuels to set future policy and regulations. The Administration has stated that H.R. 1806 will be vetoed. I voted NO.

While this legislation is far from perfect, it contains provisions to improve safety, keep this emerging industry internationally competitive and allow it to continue creating jobs and developing new technology. H.R. 2262 extends the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulatory learning period to 2025, giving the agency time to collect data and begin developing a safety framework for future regulations. It also establishes a legal framework to govern the property rights of resources obtained from asteroids and orders the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) to study how to best manage space traffic and mitigate the increasing number of dangerous debris cluttering low-Earth orbit.

,114,Male,N00031998,43557,"Gibson, Christopher (Rep.) [R-NY19]","Dear Friend, Having served in the Army for most of my adult life, Memorial Day is always an important time for me. I sincerely appreciate the way our neighbors come together each spring to honor the men and women who gave their lives in defense of our great nation. As we prepare for a weekend of parades, ceremonies, and family gatherings, I wanted to take a few moments to update you on some of the work were doing on behalf of veterans and military personnel and other legislation that benefits our region. It is fitting that on this Memorial Day I am able to announce the House Committee on Oversight and Government Reform has approved legislation I authored to rename the Post Office building at 90 Cornell Street in Kingston in honor of Staff Sergeant Robert H. Dietz, the Medal of Honor recipient who was killed in action during World War II. This is a fitting and permanent reminder of his courage, patriotism, and sacrifice, and I am grateful to my colleagues in the New York delegation for their strong support of our bill. Staff Sergeant Dietz was killed in action March 29, 1945 at Kirchain, Germany after advancing through intense enemy fire to disconnect bridge demolition charges and neutralize bazooka teams defending the road into town. The 24-year-old soldier, by his intrepidity and valiant effort on his self-imposed mission, single-handedly opened the road for the capture of Kirchain and left with his comrades an inspiring example of gallantry in the face of formidable odds, reads the text of the Medal of Honor citation. We are also fighting for our Vietnam veterans, especially the Navy sailors who were sickened by exposure to Agent Orange aboard their ships but never compensated appropriately. Our Blue Water Navy Vietnam Veterans Act is now cosponsored by 220 Members of Congress, more than half of all Representatives. Senator Kirsten Gillibrand introduced a companion to our bill in the Senate and the Senate Veterans Affairs Committee agreed to take action on this legislation following a hearing that included my written testimony and input from several veterans service organizations. This is outstanding progress, and I want to thank Carol Olszanecki of Ellenville for her continued support and advocacy on this front. Improving the VA healthcare system remains a top priority of ours. Last week, we heard an update from the VA and Department of Defense on implementation of the 21st Century Healthcare for Heroes Act. This was legislation I co-authored with Congressman Ami Bera, M.D. of California to modernize and streamline electronic medical records systems to speed the delivery of quality care to military personnel entering civilian life. They are on pace to meet our requirements, which were signed into law in the 2013 defense policy bill, but we will not relent in our efforts to see that veterans receive the care they deserve from both VA and non-VA providers without delay or unnecessary travel. Finally this week, I am delighted to share good news on legislation I authored to combat Lyme disease and related illnesses, the Tick-borne Disease Research Transparency and Accountability Act. The House Energy and Commerce Committee agreed to include these provisions in the 21st Century Cures Act, which expands federal programs designed to speed the development and approval of disease treatments and cures. Both the Senate and the President have indicated they will approve this package of reforms, prioritizing the research we need to update treatment guidelines and better detect and treat Lyme. Our focus is on service, so please do not hesitate to contact me if we can be of assistance with a public policy issue or if youre experiencing difficulty with a federal agency. I also encourage you to stop and visit with me in the days ahead. Tomorrow, May 23, I will be at the Sergeant Shawn Farrell Memorial Scholarship Fund event in Kingston and the Our Community Salutes military enlistment ceremony in Oneonta. On Sunday, May 24, I will participate in the dedication of the Ulster County Veterans Memorial at the County Office Building in Kingston and the Woodbridge Memorial Day ceremony. And on Monday, the 25th, I will march in Memorial Day parades in Hyde Park, Chatham, and Catskill. The New Paltz parade follows on May 31. For more information on my public schedule, please check the news section of my official website. Thank you for taking time this weekend to honor our fallen servicemen and women. We think of them and we pray for their families throughout the year, but Memorial Day is a wonderful opportunity to come together as a community to express our gratitude to the members of our Armed Forces. Have a great weekend!

[R-NC9]","CONGRESSMAN PITTENGER ON CNN: GROWING NEXUS BETWEEN ORGANIZED CRIME AND TERRORISTS This morning, I joined CNN's Carol Costello to discuss the need to target operational funding for terrorist organizations, including ISIS. Their recent capture of another archeological site is part of a strategic effort by ISIS to sell these antiquities over the black market. They did the same thing in Mosul, and they'll go wherever they can to find resources. ISIS thinks strategically about what they need to do in terms of trade-based money laundering and other means to find resources and convert into cash as needed. As a highly-complex organization, they need food, medical supplies, and other resources to continue fighting their war. Their financing efforts now include working through international criminal organizations. As Vice Chairman of the Bipartisan Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing, I am preparing legislation to increase collaboration between banks to help them better track and identify terrorism financing moving through the global financial system. To learn more about our efforts to target terrorism financing, please call my Washington office at 202-225-1976. The nexus between criminal elements and terrorist groups are continuing to grow.

[R-PA7]","News from Congressman Patrick Meehan  About Pat  Our District  Issues  Serving You  News  Contact   Congressman Meehan joins Speaker Boehner, Leader Pelosi and colleagues for the signing of human trafficking legislation on May 21,2015. Dear Friend, I want to update you on some important progress made in the effort to combat human trafficking. This week, the House of Representatives approved the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015. The legislation is expected to receive the Presidents signature in the coming days. The bill provides resources and care for the victims of trafficking in the United States. It creates a specialized fund to support community health centers and victims advocacy organizations to aid those victimized by trafficking. It also strengthens our national Cyber Crimes Center. Included in the legislation were two other provisions I championed specifically. The first requires the Department of Defense to notify the Justice Department when it releases a sexual offender from a military correctional facility. This closes a loophole in the current system in which a perpetrator could be released into a community without having to register as a sexual offender. The other protects the rights of rape victims by ensuring that they are not forced to share parental rights with their attacker, protecting victims from even further trauma. We should do all we can to protect the victims of trafficking and sexual violence. The legislation on its way to the Presidents desk is an important step forward.

[R-OK5]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email     About Contact   Issues  In The News  Services Trade Promotion Authority: Fast Track Down the Wrong Path Friends and Neighbors, With trade deals on the horizon, President Obama has asked Congress to grant him Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), also called fast track, to write rules for the worlds economy. This measure would allow the President to pass sweeping trade partnerships without the input of the American people through their elected representatives. Despite the various myths circulating about TPA, I sincerely believe it is not in the best interest of our nation as written at this time. Myth: A vote against TPA is a vote against international trade. Truth: A vote against TPA is a vote for better trade agreements. I am a strong supporter of trade when deals are negotiated strategically in the best interest of the U.S.  economically, militarily, and diplomatically. Over the past six years, the President has bypassed Congress at every opportunity, fumbled our foreign policy, and gutted our defense. With the President leaving office in just months, I have serious concerns about the rapid pace and content of any deal that could have decades of implication. Myth: TPA will strengthen our international relationships. Truth: While TPA would fast-track the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP), currently negotiated by the President with eleven other Pacific nations, I am not convinced this is a partnership that must be done before the President leaves office; we currently trade with six of the eleven other members. Our vital, yet delicate relationship with China  a country not included in the TPP  would likely be damaged by a rivalry for economic influence in the region. The TPP rewards nations with serious human rights violations, while slighting our faithful trade partners with shared values in Europe. While I support the lifting of trade barriers and promoting better standards of living, I believe we must do it right, not fast. Myth: TPA will strengthen national security. Truth: The President has used dangerous and isolating language regarding China to ask for TPA. China is not our enemy; therefore, we should not put it on the path to become one. By isolating China, we could easily transform our capabilities-based defense strategy to a threat-based one. That would affect all of our future defense spending and could even begin Cold War II. TPA can be granted and trade agreements inked without making China our enemy. Once again, this shows the problems in President Obamas foreign policy record. That is why we need to use the next 20 months to repair relationships as we move toward better trade agreements. Myth: TPA gives Congress a seat at the negotiating table. Truth: TPA allows Congress to set broad objectives for negotiations, but that comes at a high price. Under TPA, Congress sacrifices the authority to make any changes to the final deal, and they are left with a simple yes-or-no vote. I believe the American people deserve a real voice in the trade agreements which impact their livelihoods and affect their familys finances. I believe that trade is vital to economic opportunity and our international friendships; therefore I will not support granting the President permission in light of these concerns and his pressing desire to leave a legacy. With his foreign policy track record in mind, I will oppose this bill when TPA comes to the House floor for a vote. As always, it is an honor to be your voice in Congress. Sincerely, Steve Russell  I'm hosting a town hall meeting at Oklahoma City Community College on Tuesday, May 26. Click here  for more information.

In a sadly unsurprising move, House Republican leadership re-introduced a bill similar to one women in their caucus had forced them to pull from the floor this January. This re-worked, but equally extreme, legislation would force survivors of rape and incest to attend a mandatory counseling session 48 hours before they receive the abortion care they need. Additionally, the bill would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, which are rare to begin with and often occur because of severe complications. To see me stand up for women and call on my colleagues to stop victimizing survivors of rape and incest click the picture below.  Taking Huge Steps Forward for Patients and Their Families As many of you know, I have been working for more than a year on the 21st Century Cures initiative with my Republican colleague, Rep. Fred Upton of Michigan. 21st Century Cures seeks to bring new, cutting edge medical treatments and cures to patients and their families. This last week , the 21st Century Cures Act advanced through the Energy and Commerce Heath Sucbcommittee, where members from both sides of the aisle expressed their strong support for our effort to make a difference in the lives of millions families and patients in our country. I look forward to continuing to work on this groundbreaking bill, and I am especially excited to welcome Rep. Upton to Denver this June and introduce him to the many Denverites who will benefit from our work. Constituent Success Story Today, I am proud to be able to share a recent story about how my Denver office can help you or a loved one. A number of my constituents are living overseas, but there are still certain things that must be done here locally. One such constituent had cast his ballot in the recent Denver municipal election only to find that it didnt make it to the Denver Election Commission until some time after he had mailed it. He could see that the ballot had been received by U.S. Customs but was delayed there. Because the election date was only a week away, he called customs to find out why the ballot was delayed. When he could not get an explanation, he came to my office for assistance. My office inquired with both the U.S. Customs and the U.S. Postal Service to track down the ballot and request that it be screened and processed immediately. The ballot was quickly located, cleared Customs, and reached the Denver Election Commission in time to be counted for the election.

This $612 Billion bill assures our forces are ready to meet an unprecedented array of threats by establishing sound strategies to protect America. [image = *Honoring Our Veterans* As the son of a WWII Veteran, one of the greatest honors of serving in Congress is the chance to greet the Honor Flights of veterans coming to the National World War II Memorial.For many, this is their first trip to visit the memorial honoring their service.

[R-NC10]","May 17, 2015 Congressman McHenry Weekly Update Defending Those Who Cannot Defend Themselves There is no greater cause than the defense of life and this week the House took an important step in the ongoing effort to defend those who cannot defend themselves. On Wednesday the House passed H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act [which bans abortions after five months of pregnancy. It has been scientifically proven that babies can feel pain at five months and abortions of these children are opposed by a majority of the American people. Additionally, the United States is one of only seven countries in the world Russia, China, and North Korea are among the othersthat allow abortions after five months. This is a horrific act and one that must end. I am proud to stand with the unborn and support this vital legislation. You can learn more about H.R.36 by clicking the image below. [Welcoming Visitors From NC-10 to Washington One of the benefits of representing a district that is driving distance from Washington is having folks from the 10th District visit each week. Its always a pleasure to show them around my office and the Capitol. On Tuesday of this week I had the pleasure of meeting with Caroline and Cassidy Collins of Hickory. Caroline and Cassidy were in DC on behalf of the American Heart Association. On Wednesday I welcomed a group of North Carolina Realtors to my office in the Capitol to discuss housing issues. The group included folks from across Western NC including Buncombe County. Then on Friday I had the opportunity to speak to a group of 6th, 7th, and 8th graders from Conover's Tri-City Christian School. Following Friday's last votes, I headed out to the front steps of the House chamber where I spoke to them about my work in Washington and took questions from the group. If you are planning a trip to Washington in the future whether it be for work, school or pleasure be sure to let my office know.

Each member of our armed forces makes great sacrifices to defend our freedoms and we must ensure they have the resources they need to succeed. This week, the House did just that by passing the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act. This bill makes important reforms to the Department of Defense while also improving pay and benefits for our service men and women. Most importantly, it ensures they have all the tools they need to keep our nation safe from enemies around the globe. You can learn more about the NDAA here [or by clicking the image below and viewing a video on the bill from the Armed Services Committee.

In honor of Peace Officers Memorial Day and National Police Week, the House passed three bills [to assist members of law enforcement and their families.

Veterans Affairs improperly spent $6 billion annually, senior official says [The Washington Post Lately it has seemed as though each week we learn new details about waste and mismanagement at the Department of Veterans Affairs and this week was no different. This week it is news the VA was spending at least $6 billion each year that violated federal contracting rules. This represents a massive waste of taxpayer funds but more distressingly, these are billions of dollars that could have been used to care for our veterans who have sacrificed so much for our nation. This latest revelation highlights the vital need for real reforms to the VA.

[R-MS]","Roger Wicker, US Senator for the State of Mississippi - E-Newsletter *Wicker Applauds Mississippis Leadership in Aerospace Technology* *Mississippi State University Selected for National Center of Excellence*  Unmanned aircraft systems are known by a lot of names  drones, robot planes, remotely piloted vehicles, and unmanned aerial vehicles, to list just a few. Their capabilities are as diverse as the terminology that defines them. From battlefields to farmland, unmanned systems are rapidly changing how we connect with the world. There is still much to learn. Ensuring that commercial unmanned systems are safely integrated into our countrys airspace comes with new and unique challenges, from privacy issues to air traffic requirements. As the technology evolves, so should the national policies and operations that surround this emerging field.  *Building on Public-Private Partnerships* On May 8, our state earned a leading role in the future development and deployment of unmanned aircraft systems. Mississippi State University was selected by the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) as the flagship institution for its National Center of Excellence for Unmanned Aircraft Systems. MSU will lead a consortium of 20 universities to conduct research and coordinate with industry and government partners. This national distinction is well-deserved after years of work by university leaders and the state delegation in Washington. Mississippi State has long been known and respected for its aerospace expertise and cutting-edge research. The universitys Raspet Flight Research Lab continues to be a valuable resource for aerospace companies throughout the state.   *Unmanned Systems Aid in Combat, Crop Production* Mississippi is home to some of the worlds top manufacturers working to engineer the next generation of unmanned aircraft systems. In Moss Point, Northrop Grumman is producing the Global Hawk  a high-flying reconnaissance plane. In Columbus, Aurora Flight Sciences is building the Orion  an aircraft with the potential to stay aloft for up to five days. Both are capable of collecting vital information for our military commanders and troops, especially those serving in dangerous and volatile parts of the world.  The benefits of unmanned aircraft systems, however, go far beyond combat. The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, for example, is using this technology to track and monitor hurricanes. Likewise, Customs and Border Protection is employing unmanned systems to monitor the border and help deter illegal immigration. In agriculture, drones can give farmers a birds-eye view of their land, helping them save on costs and improve crop yields. After a disaster, images from unmanned aircraft are an invaluable asset for first responders as they work quickly to save lives. *Industry Poised for Major Economic Impact* In many ways, the future of unmanned aircraft systems is limitless. One day, they may be as familiar as smartphones and laptop computers. The industrys skyrocketing growth promises to have a major impact on the economy. According to the Association for Unmanned Vehicle Systems, the widespread integration of these systems over the next decade could generate more than $82 billion in economic growth and create more than 100,000 new jobs.  I am confident that Mississippi State University will shape the future of unmanned aircraft systems in dynamic ways. Access to air space, quality research institutions, and productive partnerships with federal agencies and industries make Mississippi a natural choice for FAAs National Center of Excellence. It is truly an exciting moment for our state.  Contact Information: Website: Washington, D.C.

[R-PA10]","US Congressman Tom Marino, Proudly Serving the 10th District of Pennsylvania *Washington D.C.* *May 17th, 2015*  *From the desk of Congressman Tom Marino:* Good Afternoon, By the time you read this newsletter, I will be in Budapest for an important NATO meeting to discuss regional security issues and how to best deal with emerging threats to America and our closest allies. The topic of my conversations there are applicable to a number of important bills passed in the House of Representative this week. The theme of this weeks legislation was simple: strengthen and streamline. I voted for a number of bills which allowed the Departments of Defense, Homeland Security and other agencies to get tougher on terrorists, bad actors and rogue nations that flagrantly threaten our people. However, throughout my recent travels in the 10th district, I heard your voices loud and clear, and I agreed  the government should not be allowed to breach the privacy of American citizens via bulk data collections or other methods not approved by a thorough system of checks and balances within our legal system. I made it clear to congressional leadership and my colleagues that I would not support any legislation which allowed the violation of Americans privacy rights. My colleagues overwhelmingly joined me in that sentiment and we went to work to rein in government overreach and data collections. But we still needed measures to protect Americans from new and emerging threats, some of which have grown as a result of President Obamas retraction and indecisiveness in global affairs. So the House acted with decisiveness and passed the following bills:  USA Freedom Act [link 1]  the ultimate balance of privacy and security that protects our civil liberties while boosting the intelligence communitys ability to shield our homeland  Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act [link 2]  the simple bill which says the people of this nation will have the power to review any Iranian agreement. Period.  National Defense Authorization Act [link 3]  a full-funding bill for our military but includes smart cuts so we can slim down and hone-in the areas we need to defeat our enemies  Hezbollah International Financing Act [link 4]  Hezbollah is a terrorist organization. That is a fact. But they continue to use propaganda to kill innocent people. This bill slaps them with tough new sanctions to undermine their activity These are good pieces of legislation which I hope the Senate will expedite passage and the President will sign into law. I believe these are excellent measures to protect us and strengthen our position in the world.

Legislation Passed Out of the House this Week H.R. 1735 -- the National Defense Authorization Act for 2016  This week with my support, the House passed the National Defense Authorization Act by a bipartisan vote of 269-151. The federal government has no greater role than providing for our national defense, and I am very proud that the House has passed this vital piece of legislation that my colleagues and I on the House Armed Services Committee have worked so hard on. Click the image above to watch me speak in support of this legislation on the House floor, and click here to read details about the bill. H.R. 1191  the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 This important, bipartisan legislation requires Congressional review of any final nuclear agreement with Iran before the President can waive or suspend sanctions imposed by Congress. Preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is critical to global security and removing sanctions from this regime must be done by an act of Congress and not unilaterally by the President. This bipartisan legislation passed the House by a vote of 400-25. H.R. 2048 -- the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 This bipartisan legislation makes needed reforms to the Patriot Act to protect civil liberties and end bulk data collection, increase transparency of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court, while maintaining key national security provisions. With the threat of global terrorism on the rise, it is important that we work to protect our national security interests while enhancing protections for Americans privacy. Importantly, this legislation:  Ends bulk collection: Prohibits bulk collection of ALL records under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, the FISA pen register authority, and national security letter statutes.  Prevents government overreach: The bulk collection prohibition is strengthened by prohibiting large-scale, indiscriminate collection, such as all records from an entire state, city, or zip code.  Allows challenges of national security letter gag orders: NSL nondisclosure orders must be based upon a danger to national security or interference with an investigation. Codifies procedures for individual companies to challenge nondisclosure orders. Requires periodic review of nondisclosure orders to determine necessity. This bipartisan legislation passed the House by a vote of 338-88 and will now be sent to the Senate for consideration.

,114,Male,N00033630,43629,"Hudson, Richard (Rep.) [R-NC8]","Congressman Richard Hudson *Friends,*  *One of Congress most important constitutional duties, and a responsibility I take very seriously, is to provide for the common defense.* These past few years alone have taught us we face barbaric terrorists like ISIS and murderous regimes like Iran who seek to destroy our country and our way of life. As tragedy unfolds across the globe, its vital that we create and maintain a strong system for defense both within our borders and abroad. *In order to be effective on any battlefield, we must continue to provide the funding and tools our men and women in uniform need to do their jobs as successfully as possible.* With this in mind, the House passed a conservative, responsible National Defense Authorization Act of 2016 (NDAA), the key mechanism to provide funding and authorities for our military. *The NDAA is a critical component to supporting our troops with the tools they need in the most cost-effective manner. *This years bill reflects my priority to minimize the burden on the taxpayer while maintaining our ability to take the fight to the enemy and win. It includes cost-saving reforms to the Department of Defense, including reforming the military acquisition process, to increase effectiveness and efficiency and get more bang for our tax dollars. In addition, it provides our military personnel and their families the benefits they have earned. As the House considered the NDAA, much of my attention was focused on maintaining operations at the 440th Airlift Wing at Fort Bragg. *The 440th is absolutely critical to conducting the type of training that Fort Braggs Airborne and Special Operations Forces rely on to carry out their unique, high-risk missions and keep our nation safe.* I was proud to co-sponsor an amendment to the NDAA with my colleague, Rep. Renee Ellmers, to keep the 440th operating.We know closing the 440th would take the air out of the Airborne and Special Forces, which is why we passed an amendment to prohibit funds from being used to deactivate the 440th until the Secretary of Defense proves that this movement will have no impact on our readiness. *Shrinking Fort Braggs footprint in any way is unacceptable, which is why fighting the closure of this critical Airlift Wing has been a priority of mine.* Another component of providing for our security is guaranteeing peace and safety within our borders. *At home, we are fortunate for the courage of 900,000 police officers  protecting our families, our homes and our communities. *Every day, these law enforcement officers leave their homes and courageously put themselves in harms way to keep us safe and enforce our laws. Last week, during National Police Week, I was honored to help pay tribute to those we have lost in the line of duty. I met with the family of Sergeant Jeff Greene, a fallen Union County Sheriff's Deputy. Law enforcement officers like Deputy Greene wear their badges with honor and bravery to protect our community and make a positive difference. *I was honored to help pay tribute to his memory, honor his service and share my humble gratitude and respect.* *Rest assured, I will work tirelessly to ensure that our men and women in uniform, both at home and on the front lines, are treated with the dignity and respect they deserve.* They swore an oath to defend our country and protect our communities, and we must continue to show our gratitude to them for their service. Our men and women in uniform represent the best our nation has to offer, and I am proud to support them in Congress.   *Until next week,* [image = *Richard Hudson* *Member of Congress (NC-08)* ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- Washington D.C.

[R-SC7]","Congressman Tom Rice =====================  *Friends,*  When driving around the Palmetto State and country, you've probably seen cars sporting bumper stickers with a black and thin blue line emblem. These stickers are displayed to commemorate fallen police officers and show camaraderie for our nation's law enforcement officials.  [image =   It is said the ""thin blue line"" represents law enforcement personnel and the two black lines represent public citizens and criminals. There is a thin (blue) line separating criminals from the public and our brave police force is charged with making sure the two lines do not meet. As we conclude law enforcement appreciation week, I would like to say thank you to our men and women in blue.  *Prepare for the Worst, Pray for the Best* There is no denying that our country faces national security threats from terrorist groups and aggressive foreign regimes. Radical leaders spend every waking hour plotting against our nation and our way of life. Fortunately, we are home to the most sophisticated military in the world. Our troops are skilled, innovative, and well equipped for any situation.  [image =  To continue keeping American families safe and secure, the House of Representatives passed the National Defense Authorization Act last week. This bill authorizes funding for our national defense and ensures that our military leaders have access to the resources they need to continue protecting our country.  We also passed legislation that requires the Obama Administration to seek Congressional approval for the nuclear deal Secretary Kerry and President Obama are brokering with Iran. Both Chambers of Congress have agreed the American people should have a say in this deal and congressional approval would guarantee their input.  *SC WWII & Korean War Vets Visit DC* Last week, some of the very troops that secured our freedom traveled to our nation's capital to visit their memorials and pay tribute to their fallen comrades. The Honor Flight group also included Medal of Honor Recipient Kyle Carpenter. What a special trip and heart touching tribute. God bless these heroes!  [image = [image =   *Regulating Puddles?* The Environmental Protection Agency's (EPA) recent power grab will leave you dumbfounded. The agency attempted to enact regulations that would allow them to regulate runoff water, rain puddles, and ditches. Many Seventh District farmers and concerned citizens contacted our office about this ridiculous regulation. I am pleased to let you know that last week the House passed legislation to block the EPA's Waters of the United States regulation.

,114,Male,N00034416,43630,"Pittenger, Robert (Rep.) [R-NC9]","CONGRESSMAN PITTENGER CO-SPONSORS LEGISLATIONTO BAN MOST LATE TERM ABORTIONS This week I voted to ensure babies born alive during abortion procedures are rushed to the hospital for medical care and not left to die on their own. The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.R 36) [link 1] also places reasonable limits on late-term abortions, based on substantial medical research demonstrating that children feel pain at or before the 20th week of a pregnancy. This week, some Members of Congress actually implied that protecting helpless little babies was bad for the economy. This is the United States of America! We protect the helpless, the defenseless, and the weak. We are proud as a nation to stand up for the rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. When we kill babies for convenience, we should not be surprised by the terrible culture of violence which grips other areas of society. The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act [link 2], which I co-sponsored, bans all abortions in the United States beginning 20 weeks after fertilization, except in cases of rape, incest, or a specific threat to life of the mother. The legislation also includes born-alive infant protections to safeguard children delivered alive during abortion procedures. Currently, these children can be left to die. Babies born prematurely at 20 weeks routinely survive thanks to the excellent medical care provided by Neo-Natal Intensive Care professionals. We should work together to preserve and enhance life, not toss it in the trash. The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act [link 3] passed the U.S. House of Representatives by a bipartisan vote of 242-184 and now awaits action by the U.S. Senate and President Obama.

HONORING THREE OUTSTANDING POLICE OFFICERS Lost in recent headlines is the fact that most police officers are dedicated, sacrificial, and servant-hearted. While the news media focuses on the ""bad,"" we must never forget to thank our brave police officers for all the good they do each and every day, including putting their lives on the line to protect us. This week, I addressed the U.S. House of Representatives in honor of Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Officers Harlan Proctor, Ashley Brown, and Scott Evett, who quietly and humbly assisted the children of a recent domestic violence homicide victim. In the aftermath of a tragic domestic violence homicide and arson, Officer Proctor was assigned to drive the victim's children to the police station, and listened attentively as they discussed losing everything, including an 8-year-old's favorite dress. Officers Proctor, Brown, and Evett thoughtfully contacted Target to track down that favorite dress, and with donations from these officers and Target, were able to provide clothes, toys, and gift cards to help the family recover in this distressing time. Please join me in thanking Officers Proctor, Evett, and Brown for their humble acts of service, and thanking all the brave and dedicated police officers across the United States who put their lives on the line to protect us each and every day, and still make time to perform thoughtful acts of kindness in our communities. May God bless them. As your Congressman, my staff and I are available to assist you with issues involving federal agencies, including Social Security, Medicare, IRS, passports, and Veterans benefits.

[R-FL27]","Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, United States Congresswoman - 27th District of Florida Dear Friends, As hurricane season approaches, our community must once again prepare for storms that can threaten South Florida. Many families wait until the last minute to begin disaster preparedness planning. We should all work to obtain supplies needed to wait out a hurricane and the days following it as local crews and emergency responders tend to the most impacted areas. Luckily, there are a few steps we can take that can help ensure a safer hurricane season. As a long-time South Florida resident, I know that although our forecasting models and building codes have drastically improved since 1992s Hurricane Andrew, many in our community have been lulled into a sense of complacency over when or if the next big storm will strike. Unfortunately, once we receive news of a hurricane watch or hurricane warning, many are just beginning to formulate an emergency plan. South Floridians should already have a plan in place to effectively deal with the impact and aftermath of a storm. Here are a few tips to help your family this hurricane season:  Designate specific roles for family members such as a member of the family to put up shutters or shop for last-minute necessities.  Already purchase or formulate a plan to purchase non-perishable canned goods, three to seven gallons of water per person, and any hardware you may need to secure your home or apartment.  Have an emergency evacuation route if you live in a low-lying area.  Inform yourself of the closest shelters should you not be able to ride out the storm or stay in your home after a hurricane.  Keep important legal documents, such as the deed or title to your home, insurance papers, and prescription medications in a water-proof plastic bag.  Secure all outdoor furniture and anything that could potentially become a projectile in strong winds. During this hurricane season, it is up to each of us to be informed and save as many lives during a disaster as possible.

It's because of your support and engagement that I've been able to truly represent you as a dedicated, limited-government conservative. So many constituents have called and emailed my office to support legislation, and I'm grateful to represent folks who take their civic involvement seriously. WEEKLY WRAP UP This week, the House passed with my support H.R. 36, the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act of 2015  . Over a thousand of my constituents stood up for the rights of the unborn and urged me to pass this legislation. I've been an original cosponsor since this bill's introduction and was pleased to have the opportunity to stand up and protect the right to life of all God's children. Some other highlights of the week: The U.S. House voted to pass a series of bills to recognize the contributions and help support our men and women in blue for National Police Week. We also passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016  , which authorizes funding for the federal government to ""provide for the common defense."" As a former terrorism prosecutor and U.S. Attorney, I take this issue very seriously, and believe it's the primary duty of the federal government as laid out in the Constitution. I also cosponsored three amendments that were added to this bill that would protect and support the work of the Red River Army Depot, a military supply depot in our district which has been supporting the war-fighter since 1941 and remains a critical component of our national defense. _____ 2015 CONGRESSIONAL ART COMPETITION WINNER My office announced the winners of the 2015 Congressional Art Competition.

[R-AL1]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email  News from Representative Bradley Byrne  ABOUT BRADLEY  | HOW CAN I HELP  | NEWSROOM  | CONTACT BRADLEY  Friends, No responsibility of Congress is greater than providing for the common defense of our nation. That's why I was so disappointed this past week to learn that some of my colleagues in the House were going to vote against a critical defense bill known as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) because they believed more money should be spent on non-defense programs. That just doesn't make sense.  The NDAA has long been a bipartisan bill that brings everyone together to support our nation's military men and women. It is reprehensible to use our military as bargaining chips in an effort to boost non-defense spending and make a point on issues that don't have anything to do with our military. I made those points in a pretty passionate speech from the House floor. Check it out above. Ultimately, the NDAA passed by a vote of 269 to 151. That's very important because the bill also authorizes the construction of 3 more Littoral Combat Ships (LCS)  , which are built in part by Austal USA in Mobile. My colleagues in Congress are continuing to realize what our Navy leaders have said all along: the LCS is a critical piece of our naval fleet. I will continue to work tirelessly to support our nations Navy and the hardworking men and women at Austal.  This NDAA also puts in place some long-needed reforms to make sure the Pentagon is running efficiently. We need to make sure every dollar spent is going in support of our military men and women, and this bill does just that. You can learn more about the NDAA by clicking here  . Police Deserve Prayers and Praise Did you know that 42 police officers have died in the line of duty already in 2015? In 2014, 117 members of law enforcement died while working to keep our local communities safe. Those numbers are heartbreaking. Last week, we celebrated National Police Week, which serves as a great opportunity to reflect on the hard and dangerous work our nations police officers do on a daily basis. I recognized National Police Week by paying a visit to the Mobile Police Department  to thank the local officers for what they do. I enjoyed shaking the hands of these men and women, looking them in the eyes, and telling them just how much we appreciate their service.  There is something truly remarkable about choosing to put your life on the line so that others may live. Thats what police officers do each and every day. From simple tasks like helping school children cross the street to dangerous tasks like a high speed car chase, our law enforcement officers play a critical role in protecting our local communities. I hope you will join me in thanking the police officers in Southwest Alabama for living a life of service in order to help keep our communities safe. Just as important, as you go to lay your head on your pillow tonight, I hope you will take time to say a special prayer for the safety of our law enforcement officers. Ending Abortions After 20 Weeks Did you know that the United States is one of only seven countries, along with the likes of North Korea and China, who still allow abortions after 20 weeks? Scientific studies show that at 20 weeks babies can feel pain, and it unconscionable that those kinds of procedures are allowed right here in the United States. It is time we change that.  Last week I voted in favor of a bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks  and ensure that both the mother and the baby receive the care they deserve. As a proud father of four, I want all babies to have the opportunity to grow up and have successful lives. Rest assured, I will continue to stand up for the right to life and push for strong pro-life policies during my time in Congress. Week in Review  Ask Bradley: In my latest edition of Ask Bradley, I answered questions submitted on my Facebook page. I talked about the VA Choice Card program, Red Snapper, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade deal, and balancing the budget. You can watch it by clicking here  . Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act: Last week the House passed a bill that will give Congress the ability to approve any nuclear ""deal"" the Obama administration strikes with Iran  . I wish this bill wasn't even necessary because I believe the Obama administration should abandon these failed talks altogether. This bill has already passed the Senate, so it now heads to the President's desk. Illegal Immigration in the NDAA: As I said above, the NDAA is critical to our nation's national security. That's why I was so disappointed to learn the bill included a provision regarding illegal immigrants serving in the military. As a member of the Rules Committee, I worked hard to allow an amendment from my colleague Mo Brooks to come up for a vote. I am pleased to report the amendment, which passed the House  , stripped the immigration provisions from the bill.  USA Freedom Act: We must constantly be evaluating the balance between privacy and national security. Last week, the House passed the USA Freedom Act  which bans the bulk collection of data by the NSA. The bill also prevents government overreach and improves transparency while strengthening some national security provisions. National security should always be a top concern, but it shouldn't come at the expense of our personal privacy. Secretary of Transportation Coming to Mobile: You may have heard the news last week that Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx is coming to Southwest Alabama later this month to learn more about our area's transportation needs, including the need for an I-10 bridge over the Mobile River. The visit comes following an invitation I extended last year. Learn more about the visit by clicking here  . What's Ahead Next week, the House will be back in session with a number of important bills up for debate. Funding for our nation's highway system runs out on May 30, and Congress must pass some sort of extension to ensure road projects across the country don't stop. I have long said that Congress should pass a long-term funding stream for our nation's highway projects instead of governing from crisis to crisis. In the Rules Committee, we will be preparing the Strengthening Fishing Communities and Increasing Flexibility in Fisheries Management Act for floor debate. This is the bill which includes my critical reforms designed to get us a longer Red Snapper season. As a new member of the Rules Committee, I am going to be working hard to see this bill gets through the House. Additionally, the House is scheduled to consider the American Research and Competitiveness Act, the America Competes Reauthorization Act, and the SPACE Act. As always, please let me know if you have any questions or concerns. You can always send me an email  , call my office at 202-225-4931, or reach out on Facebook  . I look forward to hearing from you.

,114,Female,N00029077,43480,"Jenkins, Lynn (Rep.) [R-KS2]","Congresswoman Lynn Jenkins *Supporting Legislation To Strengthen Our National Defense:* On Friday, I voted to pass the *National Defense Authorization Act *for*FY2016* [link 1]. The Houses passage of NDAA ensures our military is more agile, efficient, and better prepared to defeat ISIL and future threats. I am pleased that this legislation provides the necessary funding for new and existing compensation programs which benefit troops and their families. I was also glad to see the bill includes a positive step forward to better protect victims and help put an end to the occurrence of military sexual assault. [image = I was also happy to see the House adopt an amendment to the NDAA that I cosponsored to stop listing the Lesser Prairie Chicken under the Endangered Species Act. Current rules unnecessarily restrict and hamper defense operations on federal land. Kansass proud military tradition and its number of important installations  including Ft. Riley  benefit from huge training areas which have no encroachment issues and are some of the largest and most cost-effective in the nation. Preservation efforts should not come at the cost of our national defense preparedness and this listing is nothing more than an overreach of the Endangered Species Act. I spoke on the House floor in support of the amendment. Click here to watch my remarks [link 2]. [image = Prairie Chicken.png] [link 3] *Helping our Veterans Through The NDAA:* As I heard all too often at my fourth Veterans Resource Fair last week [link 4], our veterans and our heroes are still struggling to get the good paying jobs they deserve. The unemployment rate for the overall civilian population may be going down, but the unemployment rate for veterans is still well above the national average. Thats simply unacceptable and something I am constantly working to help fix. The Houses NDAA legislation this week includes provisions that will greatly benefit our soldiers in order toprepare for their post military career. This means necessary, new initiatives for job training and post-service placement for our troops to help ensure our veterans will have the opportunity to secure a good paying job. I spoke at the Republican House Leadership press conference on Wednesday about the importance of passing NDAA for our veterans [link 5]. To watch, click here [link 6]. [image = 5-13-15.jpg] [link 7] *Ensuring Congress Can Stop A Bad Deal With Iran:* Iran must not be allowed to obtain or develop nuclear weapons and this weeks vote ensures that Congress has the authority to review and stop any potential nuclear deal negotiated with Iran [link 8]. This bill was far from perfect, but was a necessary step to allow Congress the chance to stop a bad deal with Iran. It is my hope that President Obama will now listen to what has been consistently said by the American people and craft a deal that recognizes the grave dangers posed by Iran. *Stopping the EPAs Power Grab:* Im proud to stand up for the rights of individuals, farmers and ranchers, home owners and family businesses against yet more government overreach from the EPA. The House this week passed the *Regulatory Integrity Protection Act* [link 9] to prevent the EPA from implementing their power grab and adding tens of thousands of private bodies of water around the country to the public domain. The Houses actions will protect Kansans and Americans against further unnecessary, inefficient federal regulation. *Protecting A Historical Site In Fort Scott:* This week, I introduced legislation to authorize the transfer of the Fort Scott Civil War block house known as Lunette Blair to the Park Service [link 10], preserving a treasured historical building. Preserving important pieces of our history in Kansas and our nation is essential as we pass down our values to future generations. Since its construction in 1863, the block house, which is the sole remaining structure of four original fortifications, has been a landmark of the community of Fort Scott and a reminder of Kansass role in preserving the Union. I definitely feel honored to help these local organizations transfer this historic building to the Park Service at the Fort Scott National Historic Site. * [image = Blair Block House.jpg]* *Speaking At The Eisenhower Series:* I was honored to speak at the Eisenhower Series this week. The Series works to train and prepare young women for roles as future leaders and I am always inspired by the passion and dedication all the participants exhibit. Thank you to Series for inviting me! [image = *Talking to USAID:* As the co-chair of the House Hunger Caucus I had the opportunity to speak to an agriculture policy class for USAID workers. The participants in the class represented over 20 countries across the world, including a K-State grad! I shared how my mentor, Senator Bob Dole, led the charge to help end hunger and now it is our responsibility to carry that torch. The mission of feeding children who are suffering in America and across the world shouldn't be a partisan issue. It is an issue we need to educate each other about and find new ways to help those in need. [image = Event.jpg] *Meeting With The Founder Of Falling Forward:* It was inspiring to meet with Sam Porritt this week, the founder of Falling Forward in Lawrence. Sam set up his foundation to help patients prevented from getting the therapy they need due to therapy caps, and is doing incredible good across Kansas. * [image = Porritt.png]* *Chatting With DaVita Dialysis:* I really enjoyed talking with folks from DaVita Dialysis on Thursday and hearing about some of the priorities and concerns they have for the future. * [image = *Discussing Ideas With The Kansas Association Of Realtors:* It was interesting to meet with the Kansas Association of Realtors and talk about some of their ongoing concerns. Its always great to see such a large group of Kansans in DC! * [image = of KS.png]* *Open Office Hours On May 27th:* On May 27th, Im hosting open office hours at my Topeka office from 10-11 AM.

Legislative Update * On Tuesday, the House passed, with my support, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act (H.R. 1732) which requires the EPA to scrap their proposed rule change to the ""Waters of the U.S."" It would also force the EPA to issue a new rule based on input from the public, states, and stakeholders affected by the rule. * I was also proud to co-sponsor the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.R. 36). This bill passed the House and prohibits an abortion of an unborn child that has surpassed 20 weeks after fertilization. Rest assured, I will always fight to protect the most vulnerable among us. * With the support of Congresswoman Renee Ellmers, Congressman Richard Hudson, and myself, an amendment was added to the FY16 National Defense Authorization Act that prohibits funds from being used to deactivate the 440th Airlift Wing until the Secretary of Defense certifies that this movement will have no impact on airborne and special operations unit readiness. The ability of our troops to train is tantamount to our national defense. * Today, the House passed, and I voted for, the National Defense Authorization Act (H.R. 1735) which authorizes the necessary funding for the Department of Defense and fulfills Congress Constitutional responsibility to provide for the common defense.

[R-MN3]","Congressman Erik Paulsen, Minnesota's 3rd District Dear Friend, With it being National Police Week, a number of our local law enforcement members visited Washington to participate in memorials dedicated to fallen officers and talk about issues affecting their occupation. Congress took action on a number of bills to support our law enforcement officers including a bill I authored this week as well. You can read more about what my legislation would do below. Our nation's police officers put their lives on the line to protect their communities and they deserve our respect and support. Last week, I spoke at a luncheon on the opportunities that trade presents for Minnesota businesses to sell goods and products to the 95% of world's consumers that live outside of the United States. In addition, trade gives us an oppurtunity to set the rules using our standards and values, instead of countries like China. You can read more about my speech here [link 1]. If I can be of help to you or your family, dont hesitate to give my office a call. Join the conversation online by visiting my website [link 2], Facebook [link 3] page, Twitter [link 4], and don't forget to watch my weekly video, Erik's Correspondence Corner [link 5]. [image = [link 6] Sincerely, [image = Erik Paulsen Member of Congress * Supporting the Families of our Police Officers, Firefighters, and EMTs* Every day, our nations police officers, firefighters, and EMTs put their lives on the line to keep their communities safe. It's important that these public safety officers know that we support them and the job they do. Legislation I authored to support families of fallen public safety officers passed the House of Representatives and the Senate in unanimous votes this week. The bill, H.R. 606, the *Dont Tax Our Fallen Public Safety Heroes Act*, clarifies federal law to make sure that both federal and state benefits for fallen public safety officers are not subject to federal income tax. There has been some question if these death benefits were eligible for taxation by the IRS -- including a New Hampshire family whose tax status remains unclear over a year after a family member was killed in the line of duty. This is wrong and my legislation will fix the problem to give certainty to our public safety officers and their loved ones. It now heads to the President's desk to be signed into law. Watch video of me speaking on the House floor in favor of the legislation [link 7].  * Ensuring Congressional Oversight of Any Potential Nuclear Iran Deal* Congress is united in its understanding that a nuclear Iran poses a threat to the United States, Israel, and stability in both the Middle East and around the globe. This week, the House passed legislation, the *Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act*, in an overwhelmingly bipartisan vote that ensures any potential nuclear deal with Iran would be subject to Congressional review. With the bill already approved by the Senate, it now heads to the President's desk with veto-proof majorities. Any potential deal negotiated by the Administration should be fully reviewed by the legislative branch to ensure it's consistent with American interests both now and into the future.  * Awarding the Congressional Award to Minnetonka Student* Last week, I presented Hopkins High School student Katherine Craemer with a Congressional Award silver medal. The Congressional Award is given to young Americans that set and meet goals in four program areas; voluntary public service, personal development, physical fitness, and expedition/exploration. Congress established the award in 1979 and youth between ages 13 and 23 are eligible to participate. In order to qualify for a silver medal, a participant must devote a minimum of 400 hours and 12 months to the program. For her Voluntary Public Service, Katherine spent her time assisting at Methodist Hospital and Chapel View Nursing Home. The silver medal is a tangible award that recognizes the intangible benefits of developing initiative, serving others, and reaching personal goals. Congratulations to Katherine on her hard-earned award!   [image = View.JPG] Erik taking pictures with students from Edina's Valley View Middle School on the Capitol steps.

Thats why the House and Senate have each now overwhelmingly passed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act [link 3]*  bipartisan legislation toguaranteeCongressional oversight of these talks. Iran is the largest state sponsor of terror in the world; a hybrid of the radical, oppressive hijacking of religion and a totalitarian government inspired by conflict and domination.

,114,Male,N00012672,43363,"Pearce, Stevan “Steve” (Rep.) [R-NM2]","Congressman Steve Pearce, Representing the 2nd District of New Mexico *CONGRESSMAN PEARCE VOTES TO END NSA ASSAULT ON AMERICANS CIVIL LIBERTIES* By a vote of 338-88, the House of Representatives today passed the USA FREEDOM Act (H.R. 2048). This bipartisan bill reforms and improves our nations foreign intelligence-gathering programs, while enhancing privacy and civil liberty protections. Following his vote for approval, U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce issued this statement: The federal government must be held accountable for its actions, said Pearce. Since the revelations of gross abuses of power by the NSA in 2013, the American people have rightly voiced significant alarm at the governments actions and demanded that Congress act to stop the NSAs illegal actions. Passage of the USA FREEDOM Act today takes a major step in delivering accountability and protecting against future abuses. Last week, the Second Circuit Court of Appeals reiterated the sentiment of Americans nationwide  no, the NSA does not have the legal authority to blanket collect information on millions of American citizens. The PATRIOT Acts original intent was to target those who wish to do harm to Americans, and prevent terrorist attacks. The targeted reforms in todays bill remove any ambiguous language that the NSA could use to abuse its powers and violate the Fourth Amendment. This is once again an example of the new Congress working to address the concerns voiced by the American people. I urge Senator McConnell and the Senate to quickly take up this legislation and for the President to sign it into law  further ensuring the civil rights and privacy of Americans, Pearce added. Background: The USA FREEDOM Act strengthens Americas national security:  Helps combat ISIS: The bill closes a loophole in current law that requires the government to stop tracking foreign terrorists when they enter the U.S. This provision gives the government 72 hours to track foreign terrorists when they initially enter the United States (it does not apply to U.S. persons)  enough time for the government to obtain the proper authority under U.S. law.  Clarifying the application of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) to foreign targets who facilitate the international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction; and  Increasing the maximum penalties for material support of a foreign terrorist organization. Learn more about the USA FREEDOM Act by clicking here [link 1]. Background provided by the House Judiciary Committee.  *CONGRESSION PEARCE VOTES TO PROTECT THE UNBORN* By a vote of 242-184, the House of Representatives passed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.R. 36). This bill establishes federal protection for unborn children at 20 weeks, with exceptions to save the life of the mother, or in cases of rape or incest. It has always been my goal to protect the most vulnerable among us, the unborn, and todays vote is a great pro-life victory, stated Pearce. Substantial evidence indicates that unborn children feel pain at least by 20 weeks, and nearly a quarter of premature infants born at this stage are able to survive with proper medical treatment. Exactly two years ago, late-term abortionist Kermit Gosnell was convicted of first degree murder in the deaths of three pain-capable babies. After late term abortions failed, Gosnell and his employees were found guilty of snipping the spinal cord or neck of his victims to terminate their lives. Americans were rightfully horrified and outraged when they learned of Gosnells hidden barbaric practices. Unfortunately, the procedures used in late-term abortions are comparably cruel, and the pain felt by the unborn infant is the same excruciating pain that was inflicted on Gosnells victims. Pearce continued, I feel great optimism when I look toward the future of the pro-life movement. Members of the millennial generation, who have never lived in an abortion-free world, are stepping forward and choosing to fight for life. Im proud to join my colleagues who cast their vote today to protect future generations who, still in the womb, possess the fundamental right to be born into this world. Pearce is a cosponsor of H.R. 36, and voted in favor of similar legislation in the 113th Congress. He has also voted against federal funding for abortion, and in favor of other measures to protect the unborn. Background: The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act:  1) Prohibits abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, 2) allows exceptions for cases involving rape, incest or when life of the mother is threatened and 3) provides compassionate care for mother and child.  This legislation represents the will of the American people: a majority agrees that late-term abortions are wrong. 60 percent [link 2] of respondents surveyed in a November 2014 Quinnipiac poll support a ban on late-term abortion.  America is only one of seven countries that allow elective abortions after 20 weeks  placing the U.S. in the same category as China and North Korea -- where human rights are frequently violated.  *CONGRESSMAN PEARCE VOTES TO BLOCK DANGEROUS EPA WATER RULE* Following the Houses passage of H.R.1732, a bill to prohibit the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from finalizing a rule defining the scope of waters subject to the Clean Water Act (CWA), U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce issued this statement: Increasing the federal governments jurisdiction over U.S. waters will have a devastating impact on local economies, costing thousands of jobs across the country, stated Pearce. The proposed rule put forward by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers will threaten the livelihoods of New Mexicos farmers, ranchers, counties, local governments, and small business owners who are already over-regulated by the federal government. The legislation passed today by the House will block this dangerous rule and force the EPA to actively engage with American citizens and their state governments. I urge my colleagues in the Senate to quickly pass this legislation and send it to the President for his signature. Background provided by the House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee [link 3]: In 2014, the U.S. EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers developed the Waters of the United States (WOTUS) proposal without properly consulting state and local authorities; without considering their rights, their responsibilities, their liabilities, and their budgets; and without realistically examining the potential economic and legal impacts on private citizens, farmers, and other stakeholders. The proposed WOTUS rule would significantly broaden the federal governments power to regulate waters and adjacent lands. The agencies actions in developing the rule threaten to undermine the federal-state regulatory partnership envisioned by Congress under the Clean Water Act. Since the rules proposal, many states and local governments have objected to this erosion of that partnership and their authority, and over one million public comments have been submitted. *The Regulatory Integrity Protection Act (H.R. 1732)*requires the withdrawal of the rule, and requires the agencies toengage in outreach to stakeholders, including holding a federalism consultation with the states and local governments,consulting with and soliciting recommendations fromother affected stakeholders, and carefully considering all public comments before putting forward a new proposed rule  as should have been done under the rulemaking process.  *CONGRESSMAN PEARCE APPLAUDS PASSAGE OF THE IRAN NUCLEAR AGREEMENT REVIEW ACT* By a vote of 400-25, the House of Representatives today passed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 (H.R. 1191). Following his vote in favor, U.S. Rep. Steve Pearce released this statement: Today, with overwhelming bipartisan support, the House took action to require a congressional vote on any deal involving Iran and sent a clear message to the President: No, you can't act alone. The American people and Congress have spoken and spoken decisively, the President must sign this measure, and allow transparency and accountability into any deal with Iran. This bill ensures sanctions on Iran could not be lifted until Congress receives the terms of the final deal and votes to approve or reject them. America must not blink in blocking Irans nuclear ambitions. The Islamic Republic of Iran, a state sponsor of terrorism, has vowed to destroy our strong ally, Israel, and continues to hold Americans hostage. I agree with Israeli Prime Minister Netanyahus warning to the Congress and to our international allies: the Obama administrations nuclear deal, negotiated in secret, would all but guarantee that Iran gets those weapons, and lots of them. The President seems hell-bent on committing America to secret deals that leave Congress and the people entirely out of the process, instead, handing the safety and security of our nation to unelected bureaucrats from the United Nations.   While I would have preferred a stronger stance, the House and the Senate have united to loudly say: We will review the entire deal, no matter what you say, Mr. Obama. No one is above the law, not even the President. I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress to keep pushing back against the Obama administrations reckless deal, to stand with Israel, and to prevent a nuclear Iran.

I'm sure I don't need to tell you that sometimes the decisions made in Washington just don't make sense. A good example is the Obama administration's latest rule defining Waters of the United States, or WOTUS. So what is WOTUS? The Obama administration wants to have federal control over our streams, creeks, and ponds by reclassifying many moving waters as navigable. I've been fighting the Obama administration over this deeply-flawed rule for years. Last week, I continued my efforts by voting for the Regulatory Protection Act of 2015--a bill I helped write. This bill would withdraw the current rule and force the EPA to consult with stakeholders--like Oklahoma ranchers, famers, and homebuilders--as well as state and local governments before any new rule is drafted. Now that the House has passed this bill, it is time for the Senate to hold the administration accountable. I want to hear your thoughts on why it is important for the Senate to pass this bill.  Also, earlier this month, I voted for an energy and water appropriations bill with a plan that helps block the rule. Specifically, the bill prohibits the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from using funds to develop, implement, or enforce any change to regulations pertaining to the definition of waters under federal jurisdiction. We're a few steps closer to blocking this awful rule. But I won't let up--I will be relentless in my opposition to this federal overreach until we win. Don't forget that you can always join the conversation on Twitter  and check out photos of my week on Flickr  And while you're at it...take a look at my recent op-ed with U.S. Senator Jerry Moran  on making the VA Choice Program work better for our veterans.

I first introduced this legislation in the previous Congress and am pleased to see it advance with such overwhelming bipartisan support. Hezbollah poses a direct threat to the United States and our allies abroad, particularly Israel. We as a nation must do all that we can in our power to stop Hezbollahs global terrorist reach. The Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act will cripple the terrorist organizations extensive, illegal financial network.  Congressman Meadows speaking in support of H.R. 2297  Supporting U.S./Israeli Relations Last week, I had the pleasure of speaking to NORPAC, a non-partisan group that advocates for strong relations between the U.S. and Israel. I met with NORPAC representatives who traveled to Washington, D.C. to discuss their concerns over the pending U.S./Iran nuclear agreement. I share many of their concerns. In March, the Obama Administration announced a framework agreement with Iran that would allow the rogue regime to keep some of its nuclear facilities in tact and would lift congressionally-mandated sanctions. I do not trust the regime in Tehran to be an honest negotiating partner and have deep concerns that Iran will not halt its terrorist activity--and may even increase it--once sanctions are lifted. This week, the House voted on a bill which will give Congress the ability to disapprove of any agreement made with Iran. The legislation passed with strong bipartisan support and is expected to be signed by the president. While I believe this legislation is a step in the right direction, I do have concerns that it doesn't do enough to halt a potentially dangerous deal. I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress to look for ways that greater oversight can be given to Congress on this critically important foreign policy decision.  NORPAC representatives with Congressman Meadows  Congressman Meadows with a young Pro-Israel activist Standing Up for the Sanctity of Life Last Wednesday, the House passed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act of 2015 and I'm extremely proud to have voted in support of it. I believe we have a fundamental obligation to stand up for the sanctity of life and protect the unborn. Proverbs 31:8 instructs us to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves, and today Congress lived up to that challenge. The science shows that unborn children are capable of feeling pain when their pain receptor nerves link to the brain at around 20 weeks of age. This isnt only about protecting the unborn, but the mothers as well. Studies show that women are 35 times more likely to die due to complications during an abortion procedure occurring after 20 weeks than they are during the first trimester. I believe that human life is sacred  beginning at conception and ending in natural death. While our nation still has a long way to go to ensure that all life is protectedincluding in the wombI believe this bill is an important step in the right direction. I urge my Senate colleagues to embrace it and encourage the President to listen to the millions of Americans who support it.  Celebrating My Second Amendment Rights I had a great time participating in the annual Congressional shoot-out hosted by Remington Rifle.

,114,Male,N00030744,43544,"Pompeo, Mike (Rep.) [R-KS4]","This week the House joined the Senate in passing the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. I voted against it along with 24 of my colleagues. The President will sign this bill  of course  because it gives him a blank check to cozy up to Iranian terrorists without any restraint from Congress. When he does, our children will be less safe. There is no longer any real hope that Congress can keep in place sanctions that present the single best chance at crushing the Iranian regime. Absent regime change, a nuclear Iran is nearly inevitable. President Obamas senior national security advisor referred to the Iran nuclear deal by saying, This is probably the biggest thing President Obama will do in his second term on foreign policy. This is healthcare for us, just to put it in context. Sadly, as bad as Obamacare is, allowing Iran to obtain a nuclear arsenal is worse. This week Congress handed over its power to stop this even greater threat to America: a nuclear-armed leader who leads chants of Death to America. I hope that I am wrong. I hope that when the President reaches an accord that permits Iran to enrich uranium, to continue its missile program and to do so with every economic sanction lifted, that Congress will have the will to stop him. If this week is any indication, Congress will fold again. The media, and my colleagues, have done a great job of pushing the message that this Iran Nuclear Review Act is the only way Congress will have an opportunity to stop a bad deal with Iran. A few simple questions: 1. Why would President Obama be supportive of legislation that would hinder his ability to close this deal? (Answer: He wouldnt.) 2. Why would China and Russia acquiesce in the passage of this bill? (Answer: Because they know it will allow them to sell arms to Iran and create a power that counterbalances the U.S.) 3. Why has no Iranian official so much as let out a peep about this bill harming negotiations? (Answer: Because it does just the opposite, it makes any deal reached acceptable and gives them no reason to give up anything in the negotiations.) Now, instead of coming to Congress for approval of an Iranian deal, the President needs only to convince a handful of Democrats to not override a presidential veto. With the passage of this bill there is very little standing in between the President and his deal, and Iran and its bomb. Put another way. The President said all of his policies were on the ballot this past November and that included his Iranian policy. America rejected his surrender to Iran. Now, Congress has permitted the losers in the election  Senate Democrats lost 9 seats  to approve the Iranian nuclear program. It is unconscionable for Congress to grant such sweeping power to any president  but we are now allowing Obama to lift sanctions on Iran no matter what terrible deal he agrees to with Ayatollah Khamenei. It was my job as a soldier and is my job as your Congressman to protect our country from the various threats we face. I will not get caught up in the political game of passing a bill designed to simply give Congress political cover. We cannot underestimate our enemies and I will not stop fighting against things I know are detrimental to our national security. That work just got harder.

[R-FL6]"," A Message From the Office of Congressman DeSantis Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email   Contact Me  Constituent Services  Media Center  Legislation  Help With a Federal Agency  Dear Friend- Congress needs to speak up on behalf of the American people about the dangers of the proposed framework with Iran. The framework envisions conceding billions to Iran in sanctions relief while also providing legitimacy to Iran's vast nuclear infrastructure. Last week, the House joined the Senate in passing the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act to mandate that Congress to review any nuclear deal with Iran. I was ready to offer amendments  to further strengthen this bill, including amendments requiring Iran to allow international inspectors access to all Iranian military sites at any time as well as certifications that Iran had permanently closed all underground nuclear facilities. I had also proposed an amendment requiring Iran to pay reparations for all U.S. servicemen killed or harmed in Iraq due directly or indirectly to the involvement of any Iranian funded or supported groups. Iran provided deadly military grade explosives to militants in Iraq which were used against U.S. military men and women during Operation Iraqi Freedom, killing significant numbers of our troops. Yet Iran has never been held to account for its conduct. A nuclear agreement which gives Iran billions without addressing the American blood Iran has on its hands does not do justice to the service of the fallen. I am disappointed that congressional leadership did not allow the addition of amendments. At the same time, the passage of the bill means that, if the Obama administration does in fact conclude a deal with Iran, the American people with be given the opportunity to have the deal scrutinized by their elected representatives. I'm confident that such a process will illuminate the dangers of any pending deal. _____ On Friday the House passed the annual defense authorization bill by a vote of 269-151. The bill authorizes and prioritizes funding for the Department of Defense (DoD) and other select national security programs within the Department of Energy for Fiscal Year 2016, including $515 billion in spending for national defense and an additional $89.2 billion for the Overseas Contingency Operations fund (OCO), for a total of $604.2 billion. The bill also: helps reform and streamline activities at the Department of Defense; helps streamline the military acquisition process; accelerates the next generation missile defense interceptor; extends authorities for forces in Afghanistan; addresses the need to modernize crumbling infrastructure in the National Nuclear Security Administration; reauthorizes bipartisan prohibitions against transferring detainees from Guantanamo Bay to the United States; addresses the need to provide adequate benefits and resources for soldiers and their families; and strengthens cyber operations capabilities.

,114,Male,N00026160,43416,"Price, Tom (Rep.) [R-GA6]","Congressman Tom Price *Empowering Patients First Act** This week, I introduced H.R. 2300, the Empowering Patients First Act  legislation that fully repeals Obamacare and starts over with patient-centered solutions. Under Obamacare, the American people are paying more for health care and getting less  less access, less quality, and fewer choices. The status quo and its defenders are empowering Washington and harming patients and doctors. With real, patient-centered reforms we can build a more innovative and responsive health care system  one that empowers patients and ensures they and their doctor have the freedom to make health care decisions without bureaucratic interference or influence.  The Empowering Patients First Act puts patients, families and doctors in charge by focusing on the principles of affordability, accessibility, quality, innovation, choices and responsiveness. Those principles form the foundation of the solutions in H.R. 2300  solutions including individual health pools and expanded health savings accounts, tax credits for the purchase of coverage and lawsuit abuse reforms to reduce the costly practice of defensive medicine. The solutions in the Empowering Patients First Act will get Washington out of the way while protecting and strengthening the doctor-patient relationship. For the complete text of the Empowering Patients First Act, click here. [link 1] For a section-by-section description of the legislation, click here. [link 2] *Strengthening Our National Security** On Friday, the House adopted a defense authorization bill for 2016 that reflects both the complex national security challenges facing our nation and our commitment to those brave men and women who defend our freedom. This legislation responsibly provides needed resources for our military and their families. It reinforces our mission to defeat terrorists like ISIS and defend against threats to America and our interests around the world. It improves troop benefits and retirement while also ensuring returning servicemembers do not face bureaucratic barriers to quality health care.  It was disappointing to see so many of our Democrat colleagues oppose this legislation in order to defend President Obama and his irresponsible effort to leverage a debate over our national defense to advance a radical political agenda. That should never be the case as Congress fulfills its foremost responsibility  providing for the common defense. *House Passes Strong Sanctions Against Hezbollah** On Thursday, I was proud to co-sponsor and vote in favor of bipartisan, common sense legislation that gives the United States the ability to strike at the heart of Hezbollahs financing and logistics activities. Their ability to fund and support Islamic terror cells throughout the world would be severely reduced. By putting pressure on this terrorist group, America, Israel, and our allies will be safer.

Discussion topics will include stepped up attacks on the Districts home rule, progress on statehood, and economic development in D.C., among others. After Tuesdays Tragic Amtrak Accident, Reexamining Rail Safety Protocols, Including Worker Schedules Our thoughts and prayers go out to the families and friends of the eight passengers who lost their lives and the many others who were injured in Tuesdays Amtrak derailment. The Amtrak Northeast Corridor is a familiar route for our city and our region. I am on the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee and we are seeking a congressional investigation of the accident. Although the cause of the crash is under investigation by the National Transportation Safety Board, I am particularly interested in recent changes in Amtraks rail safety protocols, including the work schedules for Train & Engine Service Employees (T&E) working at Union Station and in road service on the Northeast Corridor. Last November, I wrote to Amtrak President & CEO Joseph Boardman expressing my concern about scheduling changes for employees, including a proposal mandating 12-hour shifts with reduced layover time for T&E employees. I do not know if these changes made a safety difference, but I do know that both the timing of the scheduling changes and the $260 million cut in Amtrak funding by the House Appropriations Committee, which ironically occurred the day after the accident, appear ill-timed in light of the crash. Using a Local D.C. Critical Infrastructure Project to Highlight Need for a Long-Term Transportation Reauthorization On May 31, in just three legislative days, the current surface transportation authorization will expire, ending federal reimbursements to states, shutting down highways and transit programs and forcing furloughs of federal employees. In light of the deadline to allow states to continue to spend what is left in the Highway Trust Fund, I have been raising the public profile on the need for a long-term reauthorization. Last Monday, I visited the H Street Bridge, a critical District of Columbia infrastructure project, the replacement of which, like that of thousands of projects nationwide, cannot get started with short-term funding, but depends on a long-term surface transportation reauthorization bill. The District is at risk of losing over 1,000 jobs and $79 million in federal highway funds if the current surface transportation authorization expires. In addition, with this congressional impasse, millions of dollars in private and state economic development cannot move forward because they often require new roads, bridges, or transit. However, a last-minute short-term fix is almost inevitable at this late date. I am continuing to push for a long-term transportation bill, which has widespread bipartisan congressional support. Breaking Ground on a New D.C. Neighborhood Last week, I joined Mayor Bowser and other D.C. public officials to break ground at Capitol Crossing, a $1.3 billion privately-funded project that will reconnect F Street NW and G Street NW by building a deck over I-395. The long-sought project, operated by Property Group Partners, will reconnect Capitol Hill to downtown, offering five mixed-use buildings with 2.2 million square feet and generating $40 million in annual property taxes for the District. It is an incredibly unique project that will create new jobs and investment in the District, returning three precious city blocks that were taken away with the construction of I-395. As construction and development continues, I will keep District residents up to date and informed on the projects progress. D.C.s Home-Rule Alternative to DCPS is Charter Schools, Not Private School Vouchers I may be starting to sound like a broken record, but it is Congress that is intent on violating D.C. home rule, this time by imposing an extension of private school vouchers. Last week, the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee (OGR) held a hearing on reauthorizing the congressionally-imposed D.C. private school voucher program. Along with the Obama administration, I believe that students currently enrolled in the program should be able to continue until they graduate. However, if Republicans really had D.C. childrens best interests in mind, they would commit these federal dollars to our citys home-rule alternative to District of Columbia Public Schools, our thriving public charter school system. The voucher program is a political pet project of Speaker John Boehner, not a D.C. initiative. When I challenged Republicans about why they have no voucher program in the pending Republican reauthorization of the Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, OGR Chairman Jason Chaffetz (R-UT) said Utah does not want the voucher program that he is willing to impose on D.C. The controversial program was first imposed by Congress against the Districts will in 2004. The authorization for the experimental five-year program expired in 2009, but was reauthorized for five more years in 2011, when Republicans took back control of the House.

STORY HERE Legislative Update The Caring Start Act At a statewide summit of early education providers, I unveiled the Caring Start Act of 2015. This bill is aimed at helping children from birth to age 5 who experience higher barriers to learning due to chronic stress or trauma outside of school. Leading child care advocates assert that neglect, hunger, abuse, and other forms of trauma present significant challenges to learning and social-emotional development. Skills developed at this stage are foundational to language and reading - the key indicators for academic and economic success later in life. The Caring Start Act helps children who have experienced trauma achieve their potential by providing teachers with training and technical assistance on latest available trauma-informed care approaches.

[R-AL6]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email  News from Representative Gary Palmer   Dear Friend, Thanks for reading my Congressional newsletter. This is one way in which I keep you up to date about what I am doing in DC and around Alabamas Sixth Congressional district. This newsletter will come out periodically and will feature some of the latest stories about my efforts on your behalf and inform you of events that involve my office. Feel free to share this newsletter with your friends, and also please follow me on social media for more immediate updates on what is going on. It truly is an honor to serve you! Gary Palmer _____ PALMER HITS THE GROUND RUNNING The 114th Congress recently passed the 100-day mark, and people often ask what has been the biggest surprise. Truthfully, I have spent enough time in Washington DC on policy issues that there have been very few surprises. However, one thing that has impressed me is finding a real desire among many of my colleagues to tackle the serious issues facing our nation, and a desire to restore Constitutional balance of powers. My committee assignments are the Budget Committee, the Oversight and Government Reform Committee, and the Science, Space and Technology Committee. These committees are vital in restoring fiscal order, holding government accountable, and assuring that government doesnt stifle innovation in technology while relying on the best available scientific standards. As a member of the Budget Committee, I am especially proud of the fact that we passed a budget that balances in nine years. In addition, the Science, Space and Technology Committee and the Oversight Committee have specific jurisdiction over the EPA, which is an agency that is doing serious damage to our economy. I am a strong supported of environmental policy based on sound science, but not policy based on an ideological agenda. The first speech I gave on the House floor was in support of an effort to defund the Presidents unconstitutional executive order concerning immigration. But ultimately, this isnt about immigration, which is a separate issue. This is about Constitutional separation of powers. Without question, the President should have all the powers granted to him under the Constitution, but not one bit more. Standing up to executive overreach is part of fulfilling the oath I took when I was sworn in to protect and defend the Constitution of the United States.  During a recent Budget Committee hearing, Office of Management and Budget Director Shaun Donovan faced some difficult questions about the Obama Administration's proposed budget. Our debt has gone up by more than 50% under the Obama Administration and the budget the Administration proposed never balances. Congress passed a budget that begins to get our fiscal house in order and moves toward a balanced budget.  Reducing the deficit and returning the country to Constitutional governance will not be done in 100 days. Federal spending is like a freight train and cant be stopped on a dime. But the issues must be addressed now that will enable us to slow this train down, with a goal of restoring fiscal sanity and a smaller, less intrusive federal government within the next 10 years. Media interaction, particularly with media that serves the 6th District, is the modern-day version of the Town Hall. In addition to all of the newspaper and web coverage from local media, Ive been available to local TV and talk radio. An example, below, is of a recent interview with Jonathan Hardison of Fox 6, WBRC.   Securing our border is critical. A Congressional delegation recently toured the Southwest border, in California, Arizona and Texas, to see first hand the situation at the border and what it needs to be done to secure it. (See pictures: right hand column) It was impossible to hear the stories from our border patrol and people who live along the border and not come away even more convinced of the need to secure the border, with a greater appreciation of the challenges involved. It will require increased deterrence at the border as well as internally strong enforcement policies, including ending the catch and release policies of the Obama Administration. Please dont hesitate to contact me or my office, and follow me on Facebook, Twitter, Instagram and YouTube for more frequent updates. I am honored to represent you and optimistic about the future we can create together. Meet Team Palmer District Director Ray Melick  >From Ray Melick: Many of you may remember me from my past life as a sports reporter, columnist, radio and TV host based in Birmingham, covering some of the biggest sporting events in the country. I have always pursued the big story and enjoyed them all, from high schools to the NCAA to NASCAR, PGA, NFL, Major League Baseball, every start-up pro football league to come through Alabama, the Olympics, even something called the World Trampoline Championships. My wife says I have covered every league except the Urban League and the League of Women Voters! I left newspapers in 2010, and found myself in the middle of the Deepwater Horizon incident in the Gulf, spending three years as Director of Communications for the Gulf Coast Restoration Organization in Alabama, Mississippi, and Louisiana. That eventually led to a year and a half as Government and Public Affairs Manager for Georgia-Pacific in Mississippi. But always, Birmingham remained my home. Ive been married for 25 years with three (supposedly) grown children and a loyal dog, Leo. Ive always wanted to be defined not by what I do but who I am. Im proud to be back full-time, working for Congressman Palmer as District Director and for my family, friends, and neighbors of the 6th District.

,114,Male,N00009585,43382,"Schiff, Adam (Rep.) [D-CA28]","Congressman Adam Schiff, Representing California's 28th District Dear Friend, This last week, the House moved forward on major NSA reform  something I have been urging for several years. In fact, several of the pieces of the reform measure are very close to the provisions of bills I have introduced in the past. Now the ball is in the Senates court, and I hope they move quickly. Under the recently declassified telephone metadata program under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, the government collects, stores and searches vast numbers of domestic phone records in order to determine whether there is a link in terrorism cases. This collection is done in bulk with no individualized finding or specific order from the courts, but rather a standing order to telecommunications companies to turn over many of their phone records, though not the content of the communication. I believe that this bulk collection should stop, as it is unnecessary and there is a better way to get the information we need that is more protective of the privacy interests of the public.  Click here [link 1]to watch my speech on the House Floor this week advocating for Congress to pass these major reforms:  [image = [link 2]  I believe that when it comes to any surveillance program, Members of Congress should ask themselves several key questions. Is it constitutional, and if so, is it effective? If our actions were to become public, would we be able to defend them to our citizens and our allies overseas? And are there alternative approaches that provide the same capability that are more protective of the legitimate expectations of privacy of the American people? In answering those questions, its clear theres a better way. The House Intelligence and Judiciary committees have worked together to find that middle course, and the USA Freedom Act  our compromise legislation  passed overwhelmingly in the House. This legislation would end bulk collection, not just of telephone metadata but all metadata, and create an entirely new, tailored procedure in which telephone companies would maintain their own records in a searchable format. The government would be required to go to a court to get an order to search those numbers, just like domestic law enforcement. It would reform the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court by introducing nongovernment lawyers and technical experts charged with arguing on behalf of the privacy interests of the American people and it would require declassification of significant opinions. Finally, it would enable technology companies to report in greater detail about the type and numbers of requests they get from the government. Now this legislation moves on to the Senate, which must pass it this week, or the capabilities go away completely. Its my hope that in the Senate, supporters of the status quo and advocates for reform will come to the table before time runs out or we will end up with a result that benefits no one. Let me know your thoughts. You can always share your input throughFacebook [link 3]orTwitter [link 4].

Dear Friend, When you are building a house, you have to do things in a certain order. You could not, for instance, put up your roof before you've built the walls. In the same way, no plan to fix our nation's immigration system will work until we fully secure our borders. President Obama has pushed for 'immigration reform,' but to him 'reform' means nothing more than handing out amnesty to those living in the United States illegally. As the President showed with his unconstitutional amnesty order last year, he also has no interest in following the legislative process to reach those 'reforms.' Immigration reform will be meaningless if illegal immigrants can continue to flood this country afterward. That is why I have long advocated that the best solution is to build an actual fence along our porous southern border. Throughout my time in Congress, I have voted for additional miles of fencing along our international borders, introduced legislation that called for a real fence across the entire southern border, and pushed to give additional resources to these charged with protecting it. A fence is not the only answer to our immigration problems, but having the ability to enforce our laws is a good place to start. Otherwise, we will continue having this same conversation year after year. We need to regain control of our borders and enforce the laws on the books. Until we control our own border, any other plan simply will not work.

Many seniors are far happier and much more comfortable in their own homes and near friends, family, and loved ones. While the population of seniors in our nation is increasing significantly, the number of both professional and family caregivers that can help care for seniors to enable them to age in place is decreasing. According to Census Bureau projections, 21 percent of the American population will be 65 and older by 2040, up from just under 14 percent in 2012. In fact, every day, 10,000 baby boomers turn sixty-five. Americans 85 and older are the fastest growing segment of our population. And this is the very population that is most at risk of multiple and interacting health problems that can lead to disability and need for long-term care. Today, there are seven caregivers for each person over 80 and at the highest risk of requiring long-term care. By 2030, there will be four, and by 2050, the number drops to fewer than three. As a result, in the future, more people will have to rely on fewer caregivers. Advances in technology may provide some solutions to these challenges. Many are familiar with the decades-old and well-known phrase, ""I've fallen, and I can't get up."" That phrase, of course, was an advertisement for a medical alert system that, for many years, was among the most advanced technologies available to help seniors stay in their homes. While many seniors still rely on this device, breakthroughs in modern technology have brought us a long, long way, providing new options for seniors and their families. Technological solutions can be cost-effective and tailored to meet the specific needs of a senior and his or her living situation. Companies that develop these technologies are starting to recognize the needs of seniors, and design products to meet these needs. It is very exciting that some important work related to research and development of technologies to help seniors age in place is taking place right here in Maine at the University of Maine's Center on Aging. The Senate Special Committee on Aging, which I chair, recently held a hearing to examine how advances in technology can help seniors live independently and age in place. Dr. Carol Kim, Vice President for Research at the University of Maine, came to Washington to testify about UMaine's ""Successful Aging Initiative for Living,"" or SAIL, program.

Senator Collins Appears on WVOM to Discuss Efforts to Combat Fraud Schemes Targeting Seniors  Senator Collins joined the George Hale Ric Tyler Show  on WVOM this week where she discussed her work on the Senate Aging Committee to combat scams targeting senior citizens. In the segment, Senator Collins referenced her recent questioning  of Attorney General Loretta Lynch during a hearing of the Commerce, Justice, and Science Appropriations Subcommittee. The Senator's questions focused in part on the current status of the Department of Justice's efforts to combat fraudulent scams targeting seniors, a topic investigated last month  in the Senate Aging Committee, which Senator Collins chairs.  Senator Collins Announces Support for Trade Adjustment Assistance and Opposition to TPP U.S. Senator Susan Collins voted this week in favor of proceeding to debate the trade bill before the United States Senate. After the vote, Senator Collins made the following statement: ""I voted for the motion to begin debate today because the legislation included an extension of Trade Adjustment Assistance (TAA) which expired at the end of 2014. This critical extension, which I co-authored with Senator Ron Wyden (D-OR), has been essential to workers who have lost their jobs through no fault of their own. In 2013 alone, more than 700 Mainers benefitted from the TAA programs. ""My vote should not be construed as signifying support for either Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) or the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP). I remain very skeptical about granting the President TPA as it paves the way for TPP, which could in turn threaten many American jobs. ""I am especially concerned about Maine's shoemaking jobs, some of which could be jeopardized by TPP. New Balance, for example, employs nearly 900 workers at three Maine factories. Every briefing that I have received on TPP has left me concerned that these workers could be severely disadvantaged by this trade deal. I am concerned that TPP will end up penalizing companies like New Balance that have remained committed to American manufacturing, rather than moving all of their production jobs overseas. ""Notwithstanding the vote today, unless it differs substantially from where it appears to be heading, I will very likely oppose TPP when it is considered by the Senate.""  Senator Collins Discusses Ways for the Postal Service to Maintain Service Standards Last week, Senator Collins met with Postmaster General Megan Brennan and discussed the importance of prompt and reliable postal service. In an interview, the Senator shared developments from that meeting and the current state of the postal service with the Portland Press Herald:  >From the Portland Press Herald  : .. ""'Late delivery of mail has been a real difficult problem,' Collins said. She said constituents have contacted her office to complain about the longer delivery times, a problem she said is acute in rural areas where there is a greater reliance on the Postal Service. ""Collins echoed Doughty's comments, saying the Postal Service could enter 'a death spiral' as longer delivery times drive customers to cut back even more on using the mail."" ""'I believe the Postal Service actions are self-defeating,' said Collins, who met last week with Postmaster General Megan J. Brennan. ""Collins said her biggest fear is that the Hampden processing center will be closed, and mail that is collected in northern Maine will be trucked to Scarborough for sorting and then back to northern Maine for delivery, causing delivery times to climb. ""She recalled meeting with Brennan's predecessor a few years ago, when the Hampden sorting center showed up on a closing list. She said she unfolded a map to try 'to get him to understand the geography of the state' and recognize the impact that closing the center would have on mail delivery. Hampden was ultimately taken off the list. ""Collins said there are ways for the Postal Service to turn things around, including increasing revenue. She told Brennan that the USPS should consider renting out unused space in distribution centers and selling ads on the sides of its trucks. It also should consider more 'co-locating' plans, similar to the current arrangement of putting passport offices in post offices, she said. ""Collins said she also told Brennan that the service has too many managers and needs to reform its workers' compensation system, which costs $1 billion a year. ""'Adding revenue is better in the long run than cost-cutting that hurts the Postal Service's performance,' Collins said."" To read the full article click here  .

,114,Male,N00032457,43534,"Scott, Austin (Rep.) [R-GA8]","   Dear Friend, Stay Connected  ""Like"" My Page  Twitter  You Tube  Email Austin As you may remember from two weeks ago, my colleagues and I on the House Armed Services Committee passed the FY16 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) out of Committee by a vote of 60-2. That vote seems pretty bipartisan to me. And it should be- our nation's security should not be a partisan issue. Our Committee had a goal of implementing some lasting reforms to ensure our military is better prepared for the challenges we face and our warfighters have the resources they need to be adequately provided for and well trained. I applaud the House for recognizing this and standing with our nation's military by passing the NDAA on Friday.  I am pleased that the NDAA included the two bipartisan amendments I introduced, which focused on protecting our military depots, including the Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex, and adding small business protections for pharmacies associated with TRICARE. Now, I urge the Senate to act on this important legislation to give our defense leaders some certainty going into next year. I am proud to represent Robins and Moody Air Force Bases in Congress, and I will continue to push for new missions for our bases. Before the vote, I took to the floor to urge Members in the House to pass the NDAA. Watch the video below or by clicking here  .  Need a reminder of what the NDAA does specifically for our District? Moody Air Force Base: The NDAA prohibits the A-10 retirement and preserves the fleet by including $442 million for Operations and Maintenance as well as man power. Also included is $240 million for additional wing replacement for the A-10s, the construction of which takes place in Macon, GA. Moody Air Force Base will also receive $10.9 million for Military Construction, specifically for pump house and fill stand replacement. Robins Air Force Base: I voted in favor of several amendments to protect defense civilian workers including those who work at the Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex at Robins Air Force Base. The NDAA includes funding for the current E-8C Joint Surveillance Target Attack Radar System (JSTARS) fleet, which are flown out of Robins, and $44.3 million for the NextGen JSTARS Recapitalization. Want to know more about my amendments? I offered two bipartisan amendments, both of which were adopted and included in the final passage of the NDAA. My first amendment helps to protect our military depots, including Warner Robins Air Logistics Complex, by clarifying that no change to the process for making commercial item determinations conflicts with the requirements in current law, thereby ensuring sufficient workload is directed to military depots. My second amendment adds small business protections for pharmacies under a pilot program for the TRICARE pharmacy benefit program. What else is good about the NDAA? The legislation authorizes the Secretary of Defense to provide $715 million in FY16 in assistance to the military and other security forces to fight against ISIS. The NDAA also prohibits furloughs at depots, rejects a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) for FY2016, and rejects cuts to commissaries. To read more about the FY2016 NDAA, please click here  .

,114,Female,N00027514,43446,"Castor, Kathy (Rep.) [D-FL14]","Dear Friend, On May 18th, 1965 President Lyndon B. Johnson announced Project Head Start, part of his War on Poverty. On that historic day he made a commitment to open a window of opportunity for our nation's most at-risk children and their families. What you may not know is that Congressman Sam Gibbons, who represented Tampa Bay for more than 30 years, 1962-1997, handled the war on poverty legislation for President Johnson and he made sure that those initial programs like Head Start and others were started in our own backyard. Delia Sanchez, a local social worker and educator, was also instrumental in launching Head Start in Tampa. Fifty years later, Head Start is one of America's most important early childhood education programs that serves nearly 1 million throughout the country, 37,000 in Florida and more than 5,000 in Tampa Bay. Head Start is a smart investment in education. Children do not choose to come from extreme poverty or with disabilities and Head Starts focus on parent engagement and its localized, intensive program works to get these children ready for kindergarten in every aspect so they earn an early opportunity to succeed. Head Start parents and children faced uncertainty over the past few years as the program fell victim to the nonsensical sequester  or across-the-board cuts  forced by Republicans in Congress. But in Tampa Bay and across the nation, teachers and parents joined me in denouncing these cuts. Last year I was proud to announce that a bipartisan bill in Congress restored funding for Head Start and put the program back on track. On todays 50th anniversary of Head Start, I urge Tampa Bay and Florida to renew its commitment to children and families. I have proudly championed Head Start and other early childhood initiatives during my service in Congress and will continue to do so. Sincerely, Kathy Castor P.S.

Reconciling Bills and Conference Committees We all know that for bills to become law, they must be approved by both the House and the Senate before being sent to the President for approval. In the case of some bills, the process begins in either the House or the Senate, and once passed in one chamber, moves on to the other. In other cases, separate versions of an individual bill are introduced in both the House and Senate at the same time. In almost all cases where a version of the same bill is passed in both the House and the Senate, the language between the two versions will not match 100 percent. This could be due to several reasons in each chamber, including changes made at the committee level or amendments added on the floor. The law says that the House and Senate must approve the same version of a bill before sending it to the President. So, the two different versions of the same bill that have passed each chamber must be reconciled. This can happen in two ways. One, called Amendments between the Houses, involves passing the bill back and forth between the two chambers, with each voting on slightly modified versions, until both have agreed to identical language. However, this can take a great deal of time. The other method is by using what is called a Conference Committee. To deal with the different versions of a bill, both the House and Senate appoint Members to sit on a temporary Conference Committee. These Members work to reconcile the two versions into a single bill that they feel confident both chambers will approve. This consolidated version of the bill, while certainly not a report, is called by tradition a Conference Report. This version of the bill goes back to both chambers to be voted on. If both chambers approve this version, it goes on to the President.  Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe is visiting the United States this week.

,114,Male,N00021207,43438,"Nolan, Richard (Rep.) [D-MN8]","Monday Report from Representative Rick Nolan top banner      House Approves Nolan Amendment to Stop Misuse of U.S. Military Funds in Syria and Iraq  Click the image above to watch my floor speech urging my colleagues to support my bipartisan amendment. Dear Friend, On Friday, the House unanimously passed my bipartisan amendment to cut off funds to any so-called 'friendly rebels' in Iraq and Syria who make a mockery of our good intentions by misusing American arms and resources. This legislation adds a tough new layer of accountability to the $1.3 billion fund the Pentagon uses to train and equip rebels believed to be supporting the U.S. It has become clear that we have no real friends in these conflicts where we have ended up on every side, and where the weapons we send to various groups more often than not end up being used against us. Unfortunately, Republican leaders would not permit the House to consider my other amendments to the $604 billion Defense Bill, including a measure to cut off ALL funds to train and equip Iraqi and Syrian rebels - who in truth can't ever be trusted not to switch their allegiance to the enemy - and another measure to stop funding factions that consistently violate fundamental and basic human rights. Still another amendment would have prohibited funds to Afghanistan until the Pentagon can ensure that our money isn't going into the pockets of warlords, criminals and drug dealers - adding to the $60 billion in U.S. taxpayer funds the Special Inspector General is still unable to account for in the region. I also strongly supported an amendment - rejected by Republicans - to guarantee our soldiers a pay raise. Even with my amendment, the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act is a deeply flawed bill that I could not vote for in good conscience. The measure contains $89.2 billion to continue U.S. involvement in the Middle East that has already cost us trillions of dollars and thousands of precious American lives. In order to do so, it pulls $38 billion from domestic and human development programs we need to create jobs rebuilding our nation here at home. Moreover, the bill fails to include urgently-needed steps to reform our weapons systems, reduce costs and make our military more efficient and ready to meet our defense needs at home and around the world. However, my Syria-Iraq amendment does ensure that $1.3 billion in U.S. taxpayer funds will be used as intended for equipment and training in Syria and Iraq - and that those who abuse our nation's good intentions will no longer receive assistance. That's progress as we move to reorder America's priorities. We will keep you posted as events proceed. Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts. Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below or send me an  email  . Sincerely,  _____ Message to Speaker Boehner: Clear the Highway Trust Fund Roadblock Now!  Last Monday I joined MNDOT Commissioner Charlie Zelle, and U.S. Reps Tim Walz and Keith Ellison for a press conference with Move MN urging action on state and federal funding for transportation. Passenger trains are careening off the rails. Bridges are falling down. And with the Highway Trust Fund set to expire on May 31st - putting 660,000 jobs in jeopardy and stopping 6,000 essential highway projects in their tracks - I have taken the lead in bringing Democrats and Republicans together to demand that Speaker Boehner stop abandoning the committee process - get out of the way - and allow the Transportation Committee to write a long term bill to fix our nation's crumbling transportation infrastructure. As I reminded the Speaker, it is through the Committee process that Members of Congress find common ground and achieve bipartisanship so essential for fixing problems and getting things done. Congressional inaction on this essential legislation has become a national embarrassment - as has a string of short-term Highway Trust Fund extensions that leave local and state governments unable to tackle projects that can require years of planning and design. In short, we've made it clear to the Speaker that ""kicking the can down the road"" is no way to run a government.  Over the weekend, Pulitzer Prize winning Minneapolis Star Tribune cartoonist Steve Sack offered this observation on Congress's gridlock over transportation. Despite the wishes of a cadre of Tea Party Republicans who want to end federal highway funding all together, Congress will almost certainly pass some kind of Highway Trust Fund extension before the deadline. In fact, Transportation Committee Chair Bill Shuster and Ways & Means Committee Chair Paul Ryan are already floating a proposal for a two-month extension to keep highway projects moving forward. Meanwhile, if the Speaker will allow, those of us on the House Transportation Committee will be doing everything in our power to get a long term bill written - and agree on how to fund the Highway Trust Fund. _____ USA Freedom Act Balances National Security Requirements and Privacy Needs The House last week passed (338-88) the bipartisan USA Freedom Act to stop the National Security Agency (NSA) from invading the privacy of everyone in America. Specifically the bill reforms electronic intelligence gathering programs to prohibit the agency from bulk collections of phone records through the nation's telecommunications companies - instead requiring NSA to obtain a court order for access. The bill also requires NSA to be very specific in its requests - ensuring that the government can collect the information it needs to further a national security investigation, while prohibiting large-scale, indiscriminate collection of data from everyone in America. In short, this is a win-win for both privacy and national security. The bill now goes to the Senate, where some Republicans are resisting any reforms in the current law. _____ Senate Sacks - then Revives the TPP  Click the image above to watch us ask the Congress ""Who are you for?"" Are you for the 600 multi-national corporations negotiating this deal in secret? Or are you for American workers? After initially voting the measure down, the Senate last week voted 65-33 to move forward with consideration of ""fast track"" Trade Promotion Authority necessary for Congress to proceed with an ""up"" or ""down"" vote on the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade agreement. Encompassing 40 percent of the world's commerce, the TPP is being negotiated in secret by the foreign governments and multi-national corporations who will benefit from millions of good American jobs being sent overseas if the measure is approved. Last week's mess in the Senate over ""fast track"" is part and parcel of the growing opposition to the Trans-Pacific Partnership both inside and outside of Congress. We're working hard to lead the fight in Congress against TPP - meeting weekly with colleagues to plan strategy so Members on the fence - and the American public - understand that this debacle would cost millions of jobs in a race to the bottom for American manufacturing. To that end, I have cosponsored legislation to allow the American people to see the TPP agreement for 60 days prior to a vote. It's clear the vote whether to 'fast track' the TPP through Congress will be close in the House - but momentum in our fight against it is growing. _____ Congress to Review Iran Nuclear Deal By a huge majority (400-24), those of us on both sides of the aisle came together last week to approve legislation ensuring Congress a proper role in reviewing the upcoming nuclear weapons deal with Iran - and requiring Iran to pay a stiff price with restored sanctions should they fail to comply with the agreement. Under the bill - which the Senate passed earlier 98-1 - Congress will have 52 days to review the agreement - to approve it, disapprove it or take no action. During the review period, President Obama's powers to waive or reduce Congressional sanctions on Iran would be strictly limited. We don't need to trust Iran to understand that a tough, carefully monitored agreement to ensure that they do not develop nuclear weapons is far preferable to a new war in the Middle East costing thousands of lives and trillions of dollars. This measure respects the President's authority to negotiate international agreements - and the Congress's obligation to advise and consent. _____ Clean Water Takes a Hit in the House Last week I voted against a Republican bill to stop the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers from issuing a proposed new rule clarifying their authority under the Clean Water Act. Based on fear and widespread misinformation, Republicans are seeking to kill the plan before it's even finalized - and before Congress has the opportunity to fix any problems. That is the height of irresponsibility. In fact, this proposed rule has been revised - and will continue to be revised - with substantial input from the public, the scientific community and state and local governments - including provisions necessary to protect our lakes, rivers and drinking water, and ensure that EPA requirements are applied fairly and consistently across the nation. Moreover, the proposed rule includes and clarifies important exemptions for agriculture and timber, where different interpretations have resulted in frustration and confusion. Rejecting this common sense approach, the Republican plan - which passed the House over opposition from a host of citizen and environmental groups - would instead require the EPA and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to re-start the long process of developing a new rule all over again. The delays caused by this bill would jeopardize both the environment and public safety and deny businesses and communities the regulatory certainty they need in to invest in projects that rely on clean water. Democrats and Republicans alike in the Senate are reportedly highly skeptical of this bill, so it faces an uncertain future. If the measure does reach the President's desk, it will likely be vetoed. _____ Minnesotans Dominate Congressional Shoot Out  Minnesota Congressmen Tim Walz,Collin Peterson and Yours Truly combined for three of the top four Democratic scores in last week's friendly bipartisan trap and skeet shooting competition with the Congressional Sportsmen's Foundation - and Minnesota Congressman John Kline did well on the Republican team too. Our top four Democrats outscored the top four Republicans, but unfortunately for us, the overall winner was determined on the basis of the top five scores. We'll practice hard and prevail next year. _____ Our Week in DC  Kathleen Schultz, Vice President of Mail Handler Local 323, came to my office on behalf of the 15 mail handlers from her local who work in the Duluth Mail Sorting Facility. This facility has gotten a reprieve - but it is still set to close soon. Kathleen and I discussed concerns over job placement for displaced workers, and how we can best support these mail handlers and their families.  Lauren Johnson from Brainerd came to my office with the Eating Disorders Coalition - a coalition of Residential Treatment Providers, advocacy organizations and entities, parents of children with eating disorders, and people with eating disorders. Eating disorders have a prevalence rate of approximately 10% of the U.S. population, meaning that approximately 545,700 people in the state of Minnesota will experience an eating disorder. Our Week in Duluth  Our field representative Mark Privratsky met with members of Friends of BWCA (Boundary Waters Canoe Area) Trails to discuss trail management and their volunteer activities for this summer. They dropped off a box of comments from Minnesotans who support the Pow Wow Trail in the BWCA.  Our field representative Ione Yates took a ""behind the scenes"" look at the Second Harvest Northern Lakes Food Bank this week with Executive Director Shaye Moris. The Duluth-based bank is the only one serving northeast Minnesota and counties in western Wisconsin which serves over local 40 food shelves and 75 agency partners. The food bank provides the intake and distribution of foods to the Senior Nutrition Programs, USDA commodity distributions and the Backpack program as well as to food shelves and agency partners. The food bank is entirely run on donations from individuals, churches, community organizations, corporate donors (both in product and cash donations), restaurants and grocers as part of the food rescue program. Our Week in Royalton  Our field representative Tom Whiteside attended the first ever Green Fair at Royalton Middle/High School hosted in conjunction with Minnesota Power in Royalton, MN. Minnesota Power presented Royalton Mayor Andrea Lauer with a $3,359 check as part of their Community Energy Challenge which focuses on Home Energy Analysis. At the event, 7th graders presented their green housing floor plans and members of the Royalton Youth Energy Summit (YES) Club showcased their projects: high-mileage car, solar boat, hydration stations at the school and much more. Our Week in Virginia  Hundreds gathered at the Miners Memorial Building in Virginia last week for the 7th Annual Dustin Damm Walk for Mental Health. Our field representative Jordan Metsa congratulated them on my behalf for creating a long lasting legacy for Dustin and his family - a legacy that continues to give to the community. Money raised at this event will help assist individuals with medical and insurance co-pays, prescription medications, dental procedures, IDs, social security cards, first and last month's rent, education and training, and help raise awareness about mental illnesses. _____ Coming Up in Washington This week: . Congress will take up a two month extension of the federal highway trust fund - H.R. 2353 - which will essentially deplete the existing balance of the fund for summer highway construction projects. This is the 3rd short term extension and will force the House and Senate to enact a long term highway bill sometime in the next two months. . Congress will also take up reauthorization of the U.S. Coast Guard, which will include the authority for construction of a new ice breaker for the fresh water ice of the Great Lakes. . We also have numerous bills dealing with reauthorization of the National Science Foundation and various programs to continue both federal and private investment in research and development. _____ Finally... National Bike to Work Day  Biking is great exercise and great transportation - just make sure you wear your helmet! Friday was National Bike to Work Day. People from all over the country took advantage of the warmer weather and strapped on their helmets, laced up their sneakers and hit the road. Not only is biking great exercise - our many trails and scenic roads in the Eighth District bring cyclists from all over nation and the world to our region. These tourists eat at our restaurants, stay at our hotels, and visit our local attractions - fueling our tourism industry, which brings in $1.8 BILLION annually and supports some 28,000 jobs. _____ Nolan in the news...

Forlorn Glances by Maddison Brewster, Denmark High School  Overall winner: The Ephemeral Art of Life by Ruth Chaha-Guerrero, Renaissance School for the Arts Thanking Our Veterans This week, I had the privilege of talking with a group of veterans from Green Bay and the surrounding communities. They served in WWII or the Korean War and they came to Washington on an Honor Flight to finally get to see the monuments built in honor of their sacrifice.  Talking with veterans and their families about their time at war, and issues they are experiencing now. They are men from our community who put their lives on the line to serve our nation, and who likely lost friends in the line of duty. Many of them did not receive the homecomings they deserved when they returned from war.  Thanking a veteran for his service and learning more about his experience when he arrived home. All of the men and women who sacrificed to protect our nation are deserving of our respect and gratitude, and I was glad to be able to thank them this week. It is my honor to serve as your voice in the United States House of Representatives, and I value hearing from you.

Morris St. Indianapolis, IN 46221 When: Wednesday, May 27, 2015 1-3 p.m. May 18, 2015 Dear Friend, Fifty years ago today, President Lyndon Johnson announced the launch of Project Head Start, a federal program that delivers health, nutritional, academic, and other services to low-income, preschool children, giving them an early boost in life. Today, Head Start serves over one million disadvantaged children throughout the country, including over 15,000 in Indiana and 1,844 in Marion County. I believe every child in America should be afforded an equal opportunity to succeed, regardless of what neighborhood they live in or how much money their parents make. That is why I have always been proud to support Head Start and its commitment to help ensure our students can reach their full potential. Nothing has better returns than our investments in education, from early childhood through lifetime learning. Affordable, accessible education is essential for succeeding in the American economy, and it is my hope that we can continue to strengthen our community by providing children with quality education early on in their development. It is my privilege to be a champion for early education in Congress and I will continue to work with my colleagues to support these childhood programs. It is an honor to serve you in Washington, if you have any questions, please feel free to contact my office.

,114,Male,N00034453,43656,"Kilmer, Derek (Rep.) [D-WA6]","  News from Representative Derek Kilmer  Website  Biography  Services  Media Center  Issues  Contact   May 18, 2015 Friend, Its been a hectic couple of weeks, so I've got a lot to share. Apologies in advance for what will be a lengthy update. Making Real Progress for our Forests and Communities As many of you know, I grew up in Port Angeles. Living on the Peninsula I developed an appreciation for both the beauty of the forest and the opportunities it provides. I can remember plenty of trips through the woods with family and friends. Communities on the Olympic Peninsula are intricately tied to the health and wellbeing of our forests. Forests help keep our waters clean and provide habitat to all kinds of amazing wildlife. Thats why each year visitors from all over the world come to spend vacations taking in the breathtaking sites. Think about this, in 2014 alone 3.2 million visitors came to Olympic National Park! Forests on the Peninsula also provide an important source of timber supply that supports our mills, good middle-class jobs, and the local economy. But when I was a kid, towns like Port Angeles saw the timber industry take it on the chin and many people lost their jobs. The fights over the future of our forests are well-known  you'll even find books about it. For too long, the debate over our national forests has been split into different camps. We've seen litigation, aggravation, and not enough progress. After taking office I made it a priority to meet with a wide variety of stakeholders, including environmental groups, forest experts, folks who work in the timber industry, and constituents to see where we could find common ground. It turns out both sides agreed there are some areas where we can responsibly increase our harvest in a way that would benefit the health of our forests. So two years ago we embarked on a project to bring together leaders from our region and see if we could work to rebuild the trust that we need to restore our forests, promote harvest levels, and support our local communities. And a couple of weeks ago I joined folks in my hometown to mark the official launch of the Olympic Peninsula Collaborative. The Olympic Peninsula Collaborative is modeled after similar partnerships in Washington state like the Northeast Washington Forestry Coalition. It is the first of its kind on the Peninsula solely dedicated to creating environmentally sound forests while increasing sustainable timber harvests. We still have a lot of work to do but this launch marks real progress towards showing we dont have to choose between protecting our environment and creating a more vibrant economy. Check out my hometown paper, the Peninsula Daily News  , if you want more info on the collaborative. Protecting our National Park The collaborative isn't the only interesting thing that happened related to our forests in the last two weeks. Many of you have been following the news about the Navy's proposal for electronic warfare training missions and how this could increase jets flying over Olympic National Park. Nearly all the folks I talk to strongly support our men and women in uniform and want them to be adequately trained. At the same time, nearly all the folks I talk to also strongly support our natural environment and want to protect it for future generations. I don't believe that the objectives of maintaining well-trained service-members and protecting one of our most pristine environments are mutually exclusive. I think we need to make good decisions based on good information. With that in mind, I want to take a look at how additional flights would actually impact the park. Thats why I sent a letter to experts on jet air noise asking them to weigh in. Specifically, Im asking the National Park Service, the staff who know the park better than anyone else, to collect new noise samples and data. Then, the Federal Interagency Committee on Aviation Noise (which looks at how projects will impact air traffic) should take a look at what the National Park Service has gathered, along with any other agencies like DOD who have studied military jet noise, to reach a conclusion. My hope is that if the committee finds that mitigating steps are needed, they will be able to prescribe the right approach. You can read more about my efforts in the Seattle P-I  . Providing Financial Aid Opportunities for Future Teachers As the son of two school teachers (and as the dad of two awesome little girls), I know how important it is to attract and retain great educators. All too often, schools in high-need areas find it hard to find quality teachers. But by improving loan assistance programs we can better attract talented educators to schools where students are in danger of falling behind. That's why I joined a bipartisan group of House and Senate members in sending a letter to the Department of Education (DOE) recommending measures to simplify the loan forgiveness process for teachers. Existing programs to help ease the burden of teacher loans all too often dont accomplish that goal. For example, since 2008, 36,000 grants awarded through the TEACH Grant Program have been converted into unsubsidized loans. That leaves many qualified candidates with costlier payments and more debt. Its time to create a more effective approach that gives teachers the support they need to make a difference in the lives of kids everywhere. Stay tuned as I continue to work on this issue in the months ahead. You can read the full text of this letter here  . Fighting for our Servicemembers and Civilian Workers You may remember that earlier this month I spoke a bit about the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a big bill that covers everything related to the Defense Department. Last week this bill passed the House of Representatives with measures I have long fought for to support civilian workers and servicemembers in our region. For example, I successfully included a provision in the bill to authorize an extension of the policy that ensures that civilian shipyard workers actually receive overtime pay when they work overtime overseas. This is particularly important to our shipyard workers who are often asked to work over in Japan and shouldn't have to take a financial hit when asked to do so. Some of you may recall that I've also been working to stop a Department of Defense policy that lowers travel-related compensation (aka per diem) for federal employees and active-duty servicemembers who travel for work for long periods of time. Its only right that when we ask workers to leave their families for four to six months to help maintain our naval edge we treat them fairly. The same principle applies if you are a worker or servicemember looking for decent lodging while traveling to support military missions. With that in mind, Im pleased to report that we successfully included language in the NDAA to protect our servicemembers and civilian workers from this huge hit to their family finances. While it wasn't perfect, the bill does authorize funding levels that allow the Department of Defense to support our servicemembers. And it helps our servicemembers and civilian defense workers receive proper compensation for their hard work. Our vote in the House was the first step in the process toward authorizing funding levels that allow the Department of Defense to properly support our servicemembers. Its essential that Congress honor our commitment to the men and women who serve  as well as to their families. That means ensuring that they receive adequate compensation and that they have the equipment and training required to keep them safe. While I supported this bill, I want to point out that, as the budget process moves forward, Congress should eliminate the across-the-board spending cuts for all of government. Its important that this mindless policy of sequestration be eliminated  not just for military spending, but for the rest of the budget as well. In our region, we saw how sequestration led to furloughs that hurt workers and families. Getting rid of sequestration  for all of government  is the best way to set our sights on long-term growth that creates opportunities for all. I will remain focused on fighting for a bipartisan budget deal that ends these across-the-board cuts. Putting Democracy Back in the Hands of We the People Our democracy was founded on people-power. All throughout history we've been at our strongest and best when citizens have raised their voices. But all too often these days, people don't feel like they have a stake in the game. The flood of money that is flowing into our elections and political system is drowning out the voices of those that really matter. In fact, we've seen political dysfunction rise just as SuperPACs and the amount of money in politics have risen. Thats why I was happy to join WashPIRG, the Tacoma-Pierce County League of Women Voters, and a distinguished panel of guests (including Professor David Sousa and Tacoma City Councilman Ryan Mello) at the University of Washington Tacoma to have a discussion about how to get our country's campaign finance laws back in line with the public's interests. In a democracy, We the People should have the primary say in our government  not deep pockets or special interests.  Ill give you an update on some of the campaign finance-related legislation Ive sponsored in an upcoming newsletter. Answering Your Questions We are keeping my Ask Derek video series going with answers to questions about how Congress decides what bills to consider and why I voted against the budget that passed the House. You can watch this latest episode her  e  and please, send in  your questions! Travelling Around Our Neck of the Woods I also got to spend another great week meeting and working with folks in our region. Heres a snapshot of what I've been up to I joined representatives from the private sector, military, academia, and government to continue the regional conversation around growing a cyber security cluster in the South Sound. We have a responsibility to make sure that our critical infrastructure is protected from threats, and our region is leading the way in innovation.  I continued my week at a Regional Access and Mobility Partnership (RAMP) meeting at the Port of Tacoma. I focused my remarks on the need for Congress to get to work on the Reauthorization of the Surface Transportation Bill and fixing the long term solvency of the Highway Trust Fund. Our region has a lot to gain from these federal investments in transportation infrastructure - from our ports to local businesses to users of public transit.  I was happy to join the South Puget Sound Salmon Enhancment Group (also known as the SPSSEG for those of you into brevity) and stakeholders like Metro Parks Tacoma and EarthCorps to tour an innovative habitat and salmon restoration project at Tacoma's Titlow Beach! A big thanks to Lance Winecka for the invitation and to all of those working so hard on this effort!  I finished up my week with another delicious Kilmer at Your Company for the books. Clark and Tami showed me around their company, CB's Nuts. Not only do they roast all their own nuts and sell their product nationally, but they are employing 30 folks in Kitsap County!

[R-NC]","Richard Burr, US Senator North Carolina This week, students and parents received good news: federal student loan interest rates are set to drop for the upcoming school year to 4.29 percent, down from 4.66 percent. I am thrilled students in North Carolina, and all across our nation, will see the interest rates on their student loans drop for the next year, in addition to over $8 billion in savings from the past year. When I introduced the Bipartisan Student Loan Certainty Act [link 1]two years ago, I knew this law would benefit 100% of students in the US, and with todays news, our students and parents continue to reap the benefits. The facts now show that more controversial legislation would not have served students best interests. My bill was the right solution at the right time. ICYMI: McClatchy did a story [link 2] on my investigation into the U.S. Customs and Border Protection which has failed to collect millions of dollars in duties from Chinese furniture manufactures, leaving North Carolina businesses hurting. In the article, McClatchy notes: More than half of the money, $156 million, is owed to five companies based in North Carolina or that have operations in the Tarheel state, according to estimates of CBP data by Schumers office. Read the article in full here [link 3]. This week the Agency for Toxic Substances and Disease Registry and the Veterans Administration held a meeting in Greensboro. The meeting focused on the ongoing effort to convince the VA to rely on the most recent and credible body of science that confirms the drinking water at Camp Lejeune was highly contaminated with known human carcinogens from the 1950s to 1987, and led to service related disabilities, particularly cancers, among veterans and their families. It has been almost three years since the legislation I sponsored, the Caring for Camp Lejeune Families Act, was signed into law. In that time, the CDC has released four studies showing that these Camp Lejeune families have a higher risk of certain cancers and a higher mortality rate. Yet the VA continues to drag its feet and disagree with the governments leading scientists. It's unconscionable that less than 10 percent of these sick veterans have gotten disability benefits. If the VA won't listen to the law or to scientists, what's it going to take? Check out this story from the Jacksonville Daily News [link 4] for more information on the meeting. This week the House passed H.R. 2048, which will severely hurt our intelligence communitys ability to protect Americans from danger. As terror groups such as the Islamic State and Al-Qaida grow in number, capability, and technical sophistication, now is not the time to turn to an untested, unproven proposal as the House has done.

Butterfield (D-NC-01), in introducing The Road to Opportunity and Development (ROAD) Act of 2015. The ROAD Act will open up new opportunities across North Carolina and will benefit everyone who uses our states infrastructure. Also, connecting some of the east coasts largest ports to North Carolinas cities and towns will encourage economic expansion. Im excited to see the possibilities the ROAD Act will open for all North Carolinians. Read more about the ROAD Act here [link 6]. Tuesday, I had a chance to visit with the North Carolina ALS Catfish Chapter and former ABC11 news anchor Larry Stogner. As you may know, Larry was recently diagnosed with this disease and announced his retirement early this year.

Back at home, communities in North Carolina have been holding events honoring our men and women in blue. I had the privilege of meeting Lt. Alan Hedgepeth of Henderson, NC on Tuesday. Lt.

,114,Male,N00031253,43646,"Rothfus, Keith (Rep.) [R-PA12]","Congressman Keith Rothfus Dear Lindsey,  Last week we achieved a win for civil liberties in America. I cast my second vote in the House of Representatives to end the bulk-data collection occurring within the National Security Agency (NSA) and ban the blanket collection and retention of innocent peoples records. In typical fashion, we saw a federal agency go well beyond the letter of the law to create a massive government surveillance program that reaches into the lives of every single American. The USA Freedom Act of 2015 makes clear that Congress did not and will not authorize the bulk-collection of data at NSA and puts in place clearly defined limits to guard against terror plots without infringing on Americans civil liberties.  As always, if you have questions, comments, or concerns, please do not hesitate toemail me [link 3]or contact one of mydistrict offices. Sincerely, Keith Dont forget to follow me on Facebook and Twitter for the latest news in Western Pennsylvania and Washington! * House Passed A Bipartisan Bill to Support American Armed Forces*: This past week, the House completed its work on the annual National Defense Authorization Act, which is the means by which we provide for the nations common defense. A strong national defense originates from the service members and families who heed the call to defend our nation at home and abroad. This legislation provides troops with the benefits and resources they need to care for their families at home, while deploying to all corners of the earth in service to this nation. The bipartisan authorization also ensures Americas Armed Forces are equipped with the tools and training they need to maintain a military advantage in an era of unprecedented technological change and emerging threats. One of two amendments I introduced was included in the final legislation. My amendment prevents any further asset transfers of Apache helicopters out of the National Guard beyond those previously announced by the Army. The provision guarantees Congress the opportunity to review the recommendations of the National Commission on the Future of the Army before the Army is able to take any further harmful and irreversible actions.  * Return To Top [link 22] * House Protects The Rights Of The Unborn**: Last Wednesday marked two years since Philadelphia abortionist Kermit Gosnell was convicted on three counts of first-degree murder for the deaths of babies born-alive during late-term abortion procedures. I am proud to report the passage of the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act in the House, which protects the rights of babies capable of feeling pain, as well as their mothers, and ensures the gruesome practices of Kermit Gosnell are never repeated. We must do more to promote a culture of life and protect the inalienable rights described in our Declaration of Independence. Let us not forget the words spoken by President Kennedy more than fifty years ago: ""Our rights do not come from the generosity of the state but from the hand of God."" * * Iran Deal Demands Congressional Input*: Whether the Obama administration chooses to recognize it or not, the nation of Iran has been engaged in war-like hostilities against the United States for thirty-five years. As the most active-state sponsor of terrorism, Iran continues to rely on militant groups that murder innocent men, women, and children to spread its dangerous ideology. A nuclear Iran would be a threat not just to Israel and the region, but to our children and loved ones at home. This past week, the House passed a piece of legislation to ensure Congressional input on any final nuclear-arms agreement the President reaches with Iran. Right now, this bill and the United States Congress are the only things safeguarding the American people from a dangerous arms agreement. Going forward, I will oppose lifting economic sanctions until such time that Iran abandons its nuclear ambitions, stops exporting terror, and agrees to live in peace with its neighbors. Events To Support Our Troops On Armed Forces Day:* This past Saturday, on Armed Forces Day, I was honored to attend two ceremonies in Harmony Township and Coraopolis to recognize those veterans and active military personnel who answered the call to serve and sacrificed to protect the American values and freedoms we hold dear. The first ceremony was hosted by the Ambridge Area Chamber of Commerce and Harmony Township, with a presentation of colors by the 128th BSB Support Battalion Honor Guard of the Pennsylvania Army National Guard and the Ambridge Area High School band, with a salute to local veterans. The second event was the 316thSustainment Command (ESC) reenlistment and enlistment ceremony hosted by Commanding General, BG Richard C. Staats. Enjoy Ice Cream On Keith In Indiana Township**: Come enjoy a conversation and an ice cream cone on me this coming Tuesday, May 26th at 4:00p.m. I want to kick-off the beginning of summer with a special Coffee With Keith [link 35] at Ice Cream World.

,114,Male,N00032029,43583,"Griffith, Morgan (Rep.) [R-VA9]","Thanking Law Enforcement As you may know, last week was National Police Week  a time to pause, recognize the brave men and women in uniform who serve and protect our communities, and honor those who were injured or lost their lives in the line of duty. Law enforcement officers work day after day, shift after shift, often missing celebrations of events such as holidays, birthdays, anniversaries, etc. Selfless officers do this because they are answering the call to serve, and because of their desire to make our communities safer and more secure. Let us all reflect with gratitude upon the safety and security we enjoy, and recognize that this results from the service and sacrifice of the brave men and women in uniform. To those serving communities in Virginias Ninth Congressional District, throughout the Commonwealth, and across the country, I offer my heartfelt thanks for the important work you do. Freedom, Liberty, and Knowledge Last week, among other things, my colleagues and I in the House of Representatives considered several bills relating to our national defense. For example, I joined 399 of my colleagues in supporting the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (H.R. 1191). All of Congress, Democrats and Republicans alike, desires to prevent Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon. I hope President Obama will be very aggressive in negotiating with Iran. I believe that any agreement must include significant compliance verification measures, and that the details of any agreement must be revealed. Accordingly, I voted in favor of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. I also supported the Hezbollah International Financial Prevention Act (H.R. 2297), which would strengthen economic sanctions against the terrorist organization Hezbollah and those financial institutions that knowingly help them. This bill would sanction the groups fundraising channels, and would also limit Hezbollahs ability to use its funds in support of terrorist activities. Hezbollah poses a threat to the United States and our allies, including Israel. They must be stopped. Additionally, the House last week considered the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA, H.R. 1735), legislation deliberated each year which primarily specifies budgeting for the Department of Defense. As in previous years, I voted against the NDAA, as I believe it fails to adequately protect our civil liberties. The underlying law says if you give assistance to a terrorist, you can be detained indefinitely by the military and denied all of your civil liberties, except habeas corpus. Note it doesnt require that you know that person is a terrorist. So in theory, under the current system, you could be held indefinitely for having a new neighbor over for dinner or for giving them a ride somewhere, totally unaware that your new neighbor is a person the military has been watching because of the new neighbors alleged involvement with or connection to al-Qaeda and associated forces. Interestingly, while the law underlying the NDAA does not require knowledge, the Hezbollah International Financial Prevention Act does, specifying eight times that support be knowingly provided to a terrorist organization. So, as I understand the logic, it is more important to protect the rights of money in a foreign bank than it is an American citizens liberty. I dont agree with that logic. Representative Cynthia Lummis (R-WY) offered an amendment to the NDAA in the Rules Committee that would have dealt with the civil liberties problem. However, the amendment was not allowed. Because it lacks language that clearly protects our freedom, as in past years, I opposed the NDAA. If I am to err, I will err on the side of liberty. The House also considered the USA Freedom Act (H.R. 2048), which was drafted as a result of the 2013 disclosure of the National Security Agencys (NSA) blanket collection of Americans phone records. I am opposed to these NSA surveillance programs, and while this bill is a significant improvement, I do not believe it goes far enough in protecting civil liberties.

[R-PA6]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email  News from Representative Ryan Costello  Todays e-newsletter follows the one I sent this weekend, where I shared my thoughts regarding the Amtrak tragedy. I appreciate the opportunity to now share with you a more in-depth recap of national security and public safety legislation we considered on the Floor last week before kicking off another legislative week here in Washington, DC. Keeping America Safe and Strong: May 11- May 15, 2015 Last week, the House focused on legislation to ensure our nation's safety and strengthen our nation's armed forces. To abide by its Constitutional responsibility to ""provide for the common defense,"" Congress must consider the annual National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA). We are facing a time of unprecedented threats and uncertainty, and this legislation ensures our men and women in uniform are able and ready to respond effectively and safely if needed. Specifically, this legislation addresses acquisition reform, compensation and benefit reform, and workforce management in addition to tackling wasteful or inefficient programs. Importantly, the NDAA provides for our readiness, cyber, and intelligence needs. The bill passed with a final bipartisan vote of 269-151. I am pleased to report that an amendment I offered to express strong support for providing the necessary funding levels for the Army to meet its tactical wheeled vehicle protection kits acquisition objectives to ensure our men and women in uniform have the most advanced and effective vehicle armor critical to the safety and mobility of our soldiers. I spoke on the floor in support of my bill, and you can watch here.  An amendment I cosponsored with Congressman Pat Meehan of Pennsylvania that would express the importance of strong communications systems for the National Guard in the event of a cyber or terrorist attack also passed the House. You can read our amendment here.  Additionally, some key amendments added to the NDAA with my support included: * Requiring the inclusion in a report on the direct employment pilot program for members of the National Guard and Reserve a comparison of the pilot program to the Department of Defense (DOD) and Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) unemployment and underemployment programs. * Providing a one-time election for certain military retirees to regain access to TRICARE Prime due to the DODs recent change to the eligibility criteria for retirees living more than 100 miles from a military treatment facility. * Prohibiting the authorization of funds to implement any action that would recognize Russian sovereignty over Crimea. * Providing transparency and congressional oversight to our deterrence of Iran and force posture in the Middle East. * Adding an assessment of the U.S. efforts to stop foreign fighters as a matter of the comprehensive strategy to counter Islamic extremism. In addition, the House unanimously passed H.R. 2297: the Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act  to better strengthen sanctions against Hezbollah and ensure that this non-state terrorist actor is unable to gain financial support for their future. Hezbollah is an an Iran-backed Shia Muslim militia, political party, and U.S. designated terrorist organization that continues to pose a threat to the United States and our allies in the Middle East. Hezbollah has played a significant role in the Syrian conflict. This legislation will now be sent to the Senate for consideration. Restoring Congressional Review on Deal with Iran Finally, the House passed H.R. 1191: the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act  in a strong bipartisan vote of 400-25. This bipartisan, bicameral legislation requires Congressional review of any final nuclear agreement with Iran before the President can waive or suspend sanctions previously imposed by Congress. You may recall that a framework agreement with Iran, announced April 2nd by the U.S. and major world powers, would supposedly curb the Irans nuclear activities in exchange for economic sanctions relief. Presently, negotiators are working to finalize the deal before a June 30th deadline. We share Israels concerns about Irans nuclear capabilities, and on this matter of national security, there is simply no room for error. That's why I fully believe that Congress must have a say on the Iran deal. The Administration has kept Congress in the dark throughout these negotiations and has taken the position managing Irans nuclear capabilities rather than preventing the nuclear weapons capability. The American people, and many in my district, are concerned with Irans continued support of militant groups and regimes that oppose the U.S. and U.S. allied interests. After overwhelmingly passing both Chambers of Congress, I am pleased this legislation is heading to the Presidents desk for signature. Honoring Our Public Safety Officers May 11-15 marked National Police Week and an opportunity to thank the 900,000 police officers around our country. For their steadfast service we are indebted to our men and women in blue for protecting our neighborhoods. Thats why the House of Representatives passed several pieces of legislation to support our public safety officers and their families. With my support, the following bills passed the House last Thursday: * S. 665: Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu National Blue Alert Act of 2015  : establishes a national Blue Alert communications network among federal, state and local authorities, law enforcement agencies, and the general public. Similar to an ""Amber Alert,"" it provides a description of a suspect who is still at-large. * H.R. 606: Dont Tax Our Fallen Public Safety Heroes Act  : guarantees that in the event of a police officers death, families are not unduly burdened with taxes. This is identical to legislation that passed the Senate by unanimous consent, so the bill will now go to the Presidents desk for signature. * H.R. 2146: Defending Public Safety Employees Retirement Act:  extends tax benefits to Federal law enforcement officers, firefighters, air traffic controllers, and state and local public safety officers, and would allow them to make penalty-free withdrawals from both defined benefit and defined contribution retirement accounts beginning at age 50. * H.R. 723: Fallen Heroes Flag Act of 2015  : authorizes members of the House of Representatives to provide an American flag that has been flown over the U.S. Capitol at the request of, and at no cost to, the immediate family of a fire fighter, law enforcement officer, member of a rescue squad or ambulance crew, or public safety officer who has died in the line of duty. National Security and Intelligence On Wednesday, the House continued its efforts to protect civil liberties, improve surveillance authorities, and provide necessary reforms to the nations intelligence-gathering programs operated under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). H.R. 2048: the Uniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ensuring Effective Discipline Over Monitoring Act  (USA FREEDOM Act) specifically addresses language in FISA that was too broad and gave data gathering programs the ability to collect Americans' personal information. Specifically, H.R. 2048: * Ends bulk data collection. * Prevents government overreach by prohibiting large-scale indiscriminate collection of metadata. * Strengthens protections for civil liberties by establishing a panel of experts to advise the FISA court. * Increases transparency by requiring declassification and disclosure of all significant opinions of FISA court. * Protects our national security by ending loopholes that currently make it challenging to track foreign terrorists as they enter and leave the country. I supported this bipartisan legislation to ensure the intelligence community has the necessary tools to ensure our safety but not at the expense of Americans' civil liberties. The USA Freedom Act passed the House with a bipartisan vote of 338 - 88 and will now be sent to the Senate for consideration. I will continue to provide you with these legislative updates in the coming days and weeks.

Yes, I am willing to pay a few dollars more to improve my local airport. No, airports already have enough money. I don't fly often enough for this to impact me.

,114,Male,N00031502,43543,"Yoder, Kevin (Rep.) [R-KS3]","Congressman Kevin Yoder, Proudly Representing the 3rd District of Kansas ========================================================================= * Unconstitutional Surveillance* On Wednesday, I voted against the *USA Freedom Act* [link 1], which the House of Representatives passed by a vote of 338-88.  [image = [image = Click here to read the *Topeka Capital-Journal*'s coverage of last week's vote. [link 2]  Wednesday's vote undid the progress made by the Second Circuit's ruling on the NSAs bulk collection of our phone records by reauthorizing the program. Protecting every American from the threat of terrorism is the utmost responsibility of the federal government, but we cannot simply discard the civil liberties enshrined in our Bill of Rights.  My preference would have been to advance a version of the USA Freedom Act that not only ensures the protection of our national security, but also includes essential reforms to our governments surveillance of its own citizens. While the bill that passed has improvements over the status quo, it leaves glaring loopholes that allow the government to abuse the privacy rights of innocent Americans. [image = Click here to watch a YouTube video of Congressman Yoder's testimony before the Rules Committee. [link 3] One such loophole is outdated federal law that allows government agencies to search Americans digital communications without probable cause if they simply wait 180 days. Allowing the consideration of my *Email Privacy Act* [link 4] as an amendment to the legislation passed last week would have done away with this loophole and significantly strengthened the overall bill.  Unfortunately, while many members of the Rules Committee vocally support this commonsense update, the committee ruled my amendment out of order and it was not allowed consideration on the House floor. While Im disappointed, I will continue to fight for the privacy rights of American citizens. I will work with Chairman Goodlatte and House Leadership to pursue every legislative avenue to pass the Email Privacy Act before the end of this session. * Fighting for Life* [image = On Wednesday, the House of Representatives passed the *Pain Capable Unborn Child Act* [link 5] by a vote of 242-184, with my support. Substantial medical evidence has shown that unborn children are capable of feeling pain five months into a pregnancy. Additionally, a recent study showed that nearly one-fourth of infants born at five months survive after they are given medical treatment. Sadly, many children at the same stage of development or later are not allowed a chance at a full life. The Pain Capable Unborn Child Act puts a stop to this barbaric practice  not unlike what was uncovered at Dr. Kermit Gosnells clinic in Philadelphia two years ago.  Passing this bill was not only morally the right thing to do, but it is also supported by a significant majority of the American people. As of 2013, 64% of Americans indicated support for this particular bill and 80% of Americans indicated opposition to third-trimester abortions.  As the 114th Congress continues, I look forward to working with my colleagues to protect the sanctity of life wherever possible. * Congressional Oversight on Iran Nuclear Deal* [image = On Thursday, I voted for the *Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act* [link 6], which prevents the president from unilaterally lifting sanctions on Iran if Congress votes to disapprove a final nuclear deal with Iran. This bipartisan legislation reasserts Congress constitutional role in overseeing the Administrations nuclear deal with Iran. The founders smartly vested the authority to approve foreign treaties with the legislature in order to reflect the will of the American people. This power is especially important to reinforce with an Administration that has been so fond of acting unilaterally. I cannot support a deal that will lift sanctions without stopping Iran from building a nuclear weapon. Iran has a history of lying to other nations, stonewalling international inspectors when it comes to its nuclear program, and funneling money to terrorist organizations like Hezbollah. This bill will allow Congress to reject any deal that does not provide for a safer and more secure Middle East, and reduce the threat posed to Israel and the United States. The House also took action against Hezbollah by passing the Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act by a vote of 423-0, with my support. The bill imposes sanctions on any foreign entities that facilitate financial transactions on behalf of Hezbollah or its affiliates. * Celebrating Armed Forces Day by Supporting the Troops* [image = Last Friday was National Armed Forces Day, which the House of Representatives celebrated by passing the *National Defense Authorization Act* [link 7] - the bipartisan bill that fulfills Congress' clear constitutional responsibility to protect our national security. Importantly, this year's bill raises military pay by about 2.3 percent - a full percent higher than the President's Budget Request of 1.3 percent - to ensure that we are keeping our promise to those who defend our freedoms every day. Additionally, the bill: - Funds our national defense at the exact level the president requested. - Provides for acquisition reform that will save taxpayers money. - Keeps terrorist detainees out of the United States. - Reinforces the mission to defeat ISIL. - Provides lethal aid to Ukraine. - Strengthens our cyber defenses. - Increases our missile defense capabilities. - Reverses the listing of the Lesser Prairie Chicken as a threatened or endangered species.

[link 10] Each spring, a nation-wide high school arts competition is sponsored by the Members of the U.S. House of Representatives. The Congressional Art Competition is an opportunity to recognize and encourage the artistic talent in our nation, as well as in the Third Congressional District in Kansas. [image = De Soto High School senior Lance Erickson explaining his piece ""Lake Tahoe"" to Congressman Yoder. Beginning in 1982, the competition has provided an opportunity to over 650,000 high school students to put their artistic talents on display. It is open to all high school students in each Congressional District, with the overall winner of each districts competition displayed for one year in the United States Capitol. Congratulations to Jennifer Fu of Blue Valley North for winning this years competition. Her outstanding entry was chosen from many fantastic pieces of art this year, and I look forward to walking by Jennifers art every day in our nations capital. The Third District boasts some of the most talented young artists across Kansas, so being chosen as the competitions overall winner is a great honor. * Kansas Association of Realtors* [image = Thanks to members of the Kansas Association of Realtors for visiting my office in Washington, DC.

,114,Male,N00006263,43390,"Simpson, Michael “Mike” (Rep.) [R-ID2]","Last week the House passed H.R. 1732, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act of 2015, by a vote of 261-155. This bill would require the withdrawal of the Obama Administrations proposed rule regarding waters of the United States. The House also passed H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, by a vote of 242-184. It would generally prohibit abortions 20 weeks after fertilization or later. H.R. 2408, the USA FREEDOM Act, also passed by a vote of 338-88. This legislation would end the bulk collection of data under the PATRIOT Act and set up a more transparent system of metadata storage. The House also passed H.R. 1191, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, of 2015 by a vote of 400-25. It would require Congressional review of any final nuclear agreement between Iran and the President. Finally, the House passed H.R. 1735, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, by a vote of 269-151. This bill would authorize and prioritize funding for the Department of Defense and other national security programs for this year. Congressman Simpson supported each piece of legislation. Simpson Supports Legislation to Limit EPAs Reach on Water Bill would require the EPA and Army Corp of Engineers to withdraw the controversial proposed rule expanding the definition of waters of the United States Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson last week supported passage of legislation to rein in the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) attempts to take control of state waters. H.R. 1732, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act of 2015, would require the EPA and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to withdraw the controversial proposed rule expanding the definition of waters of the United States and develop a new rule after consultation with state and local governments and interested parties. Simpson is a cosponsor of the bill, which passed the House by an overwhelming majority of 261-155. The EPA has received a record number of comments on this proposed rule, and during the 113th Congress over half of the members of House of Representatives registered their opposition to it. This doesnt surprise me one bit, said Simpson. I have long known that expanding the reach of EPA regulations to ground water, farm ponds, and ditches would devastate rural Idaho, and I have been fighting against the EPAs growing regulatory appetite for years. Passage of this bill is an important step in the right direction. The controversial proposed rule would expand the definition of waters of the United States by removing the word navigable. As a result, federal regulation under the Clean Water Act could apply to virtually all water, including ground water. States currently regulate non-navigable water. Simpson chairs the House Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee and sits on the House Interior and Environment Appropriations Subcommittee, which oversee the budgets of the Army Corps and the EPA, respectively. He has authored numerous provisions to stop the flawed rule, including most recently a provision in the House Energy and Water Appropriations Act for FY16 that would prohibit any changes to federal jurisdiction under the Obama Administrations Waters of the United States proposal. H.R. 1732 is now before the U.S. Senate for consideration. House Passes Legislation Delaying Sage-Grouse Listing Congressman Simpson Supported the National Defense Authorization Act, containing sage-grouse language Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson last week supported passage of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for FY16, which includes a provision delaying the listing of the greater sage-grouse as an endangered species. Simpson supported language included in NDAA that would prevent the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service from listing the bird for ten years, giving adequate time for effective state management plans to be developed and put into effect. The bill passed 269-151. Given the impact that a decision to list sage-grouse would have on Idaho, it is imperative that we get it right. That means working closely with state and local officials to develop management plans based on sound science, Simpson said. Unfortunately, there is growing concern that the BLM and Fish and Wildlife Service are ignoring state input and moving forward with new management plans that are based on a fear of being sued. At the beginning of this process, the states were invited to partner with the federal government. But today, with just weeks left before the new management plans are to be revealed, they feel theyve been locked out of the process. This language makes sure that state voices are heard in sage-grouse management and conservation efforts. The language in the NDAA bill would prevent the sage-grouse from being listed for ten years and put state-approved management plans into place for at least five years. Simpson has cosponsored similar legislation to ensure that states have an integral role in sage-grouse management. He authored language to delay the listing decision for one year that was included in the Omnibus Appropriations Act for FY15. It is worth noting that the deadline for a sage-grouse listing decision was imposed by the courts, not based on science, said Simpson. It is far better to take enough time to make a sound scientific decision rooted in collaboration than to make a rushed decision based on an arbitrary deadline.

During their discussion, Chairman Ryan explained why new trade agreements are so vital to our economy and why Congress must pass TPA as soon as possible to ensure that we get the best agreements for American workers and job creators. To read more about his remarks, click here  . Excerpts of Chairman Ryans appearance follow: On TPA empowering Congress: Theres a misnomerits really not granting the president authority. Its actually Congress asserting its prerogatives, its authority, in how trade agreements are done. On leveling the playing field for American workers: We have 150 guidelines that are required to be in any trade agreements to basically bring other countries up to American standards. And, if they don't meet those standards, we have ways of getting our disputes resolved so that we can hold them to account. The key thing is: Are these countries that we want to trade with going to open their markets to our products just like we already now open to theirs? Thats question one. Question two: Will they come and work in American standards versus China trying to come and write the rules, which degrade the standards of trade? And so thats really whats happening here. On the opportunity that trade with Asia provides: The other part is theres going to be 3.2 billion people in the middle class in Asia by the year 2030. Its an enormous market for America. And if we want more jobs and better wages, you have to trade. On the need for TPA to close out good agreements: Every president since Franklin Delano Roosevelt has had this ability. Theres no way were going to be able to get other countries to give us the best offer and good trade agreement if after getting that agreement, we take it back to Congress and rewrite the whole thing. On Hillary Clintons support for TPA: I think she is just being more political and more worried about her political base. I would assume she is in favor of it, given her past comments, given her role, but my guess is she is worried more about her Democratic primary politics. _____ Do you want to unsubscribe and no longer receive InstantNewsUPDATES?

Important House Votes Protecting the Unborn H.R. 36 - Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act  As a staunch defender of the unborn, I was proud to vote last week on a bill to ban the cruel practice of ending an innocent life that feels pain. The Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act  prohibits doctors from performing abortions on unborn children beginning at 20 weeks and protects mothers in instances of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is at stake. The bill passed the House by a vote of 242-184. Limiting Obama's Role in Iran Negotiations H.R. 1191 - Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015  Iran has repeatedly demonstrated their commitment to securing nuclear weapons and they must be stopped. However, I have serious concerns with the tentative agreement reached by Iran and the White House. That's why I voted for HR 1191; the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. This bill would prevent the president from unilaterally lifting sanctions on Iran if Congress votes to disapprove a final nuclear deal with Iran  . This bill limits President Obama's executive overreach and puts the power back with the people. The House passed H.R. 1191 by a vote of 400-25. The Senate previously passed the same bill by a vote of 98-1. It now heads to the president for his signature. Balancing Security and Privacy H.R. 2048 - USA Freedom Act of 2015  No American wants a repeat of the atrocities we faced on 9/11/01. Our nation's ability to protect itself relies in part, on our ability to connect the dots in our intelligence gathering. But we must have a careful balance between legal law enforcement and individual protections against an overreaching government. That's why I voted in support of the USA Freedom Act  , which protects civil liberties by ending bulk collection. Specifically it prohibits bulk collection of ALL records under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, the FISA pen register authority, and national security letter statutes. It also improves transparency and information-sharing by requiring that all significant constructions or interpretations of law by the FISA court must be made public. I believe this bill corrects an important flaw to strengthen civil liberties for American citizens, while helping us prevent another attack. National Police Week Last week, we honored our public service heroes by observing National Police Week. I am grateful for their service and sacrifice every single day. The House passed legislation to give our local heroes the support they deserve. H.R. 606 - Don't Tax Our Fallen Public Safety Heroes Act  This bill amends the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax code to exclude fallen service member benefits from being considered taxable income. H.R.2146 - Defending Public Safety Employees' Retirement Act  This bill expands the IRS tax code to exempt law enforcement officials from a 10% penalty tax when collecting early retirement. H.R. 723 - Fallen Heroes Flag Act of 2015  This bill allows Representatives to provide the families of fallen heroes with an American flag flown over the Capitol in remembrance of their loved one. S. 665 - Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu National Blue Alert Act of 2015  This bill requires the Department of Justice to create a national communication network, Blue Alert, to quickly provide information in the event an officer is hurt in the line of duty.

[R-TX19]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email  News from Representative Randy Neugebauer   May 18, 2015 The Fight Against ISIS Over the weekend, we learned U.S. Special Operations forces successfully conducted a raid against Abu Sayyaf, a high-profile ISIS leader. Sayyaf is believed to be responsible for ISIS' finances, specifically their black market oil and gas operation. I commend our service members on the frontlines who courageously went into harm's way to carry out this successful raid. While the death of Sayyaf is undoubtedly a setback for ISIS, we also learned that the terrorist group recently seized control of Ramadi, the capital of Iraq's largest province. This is a very troubling development. I continue to believe the Obama administration must present a clearer plan to defeat and destroy ISIS, and stop the spread of terrorism. In this time of increased threats, the House took two important votes last week to ensure our military has the tools needed to keep America safe. With my support, the House passed the National Defense Authorization Act of 2015 to authorize funding for the Department of Defense. The House also passed the USA FREEDOM Act to enable our security agencies to gather intelligence on suspected terrorists and prevent future attacks, while balancing our civil liberties. I am hopeful that the Senate will quickly act on both of these important bills. Neugebauer Introduces Endangered Species Act Reform Legislation For far too long, bureaucrats in Washington have used the Endangered Species Act (ESA) to bring heavy-handed regulations to hardworking farmers, ranchers, and business owners in West Texas and the Big Country. These regulations are incredibly expensive and can greatly harm future opportunity in the communities most impacted. Last Friday, I introduced H.R. 2352, the State, Tribal, and Local Species Transparency and Recovery Act. This legislation would require the federal government to disclose to affected states all data used prior to any ESA listing decisions and require that the ""best available scientific and commercial data"" used by the federal government include data provided by affected states, tribes, and local governments. I believe it's time to give communities across America a greater say in the ESA listing process and increase transparency. I introduced similar legislation last Congress that was packaged into a comprehensive Endangered Species Act reform bill that passed the House. You can read more about my bill in the Abilene Reporter-News  . A Funding Blueprint for the Federal Government This week, the House will continue the appropriations process-the process of providing funding for the federal government's operations. At a time when our nation is $18 trillion and counting in debt, this process is all the more important. This week, the House is expected to vote on the Legislative Branch Appropriations bill which funds the U.S. Capitol and Congress' essential operations. Since Republicans gained control of the House in January of 2011, we reduced our own funding by 14% and prevented pay increases for Members of Congress. While this is the smallest of the 12 Appropriations bills, it prioritizes the conservative solutions we must bring to every area of the federal government.  Not a Roundup Subscriber Yet?

,114,Male,N00033310,43640,"Wenstrup, Brad (Rep.) [R-OH2]","It's been a busy week in Congress, with the House of Representatives passing legislation ranging from reforming the NSA to reining in EPA regulations and from protecting the life of the unborn to providing for our military. Take a moment to read more and take part in a short survey at the end of this email: Real Reforms to the NSA This week, the House of Representatives passed the USA Freedom Act, significant legislation to preserve our intelligence gathering capabilities while increasing privacy protections. This legislation is real, significant reform that balances security needs and privacy rights: -Prohibits bulk collection of ALL records under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, the FISA pen register authority, and national security letter statutes. -Prevents government overreach: The bulk collection prohibition is strengthened by prohibiting large-scale, indiscriminate collection, such as all records from an entire state, city, or zip code. -Increases civil liberty protections -Restricts government overreach at the FISA courts In the Senate, this legislation is sponsored by Senators ranging from Mike Lee of Utah and Ted Cruz from Texas to Patrick Leahy of Vermont and Al Franken of Minnesota, demonstrating the wide bipartisan support for these reforms. Defending the Unborn House passes Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.R. 36) Two years ago, abortionist Dr. Kermit Gosnell was convicted of killing numerous pre-maturely born babies by severing their spines immediately after birth, one of many abortion procedures scientifically known to inflict tremendous pain on unborn children as young as 20 weeks. On Wednesday, May 13, the House of Representatives passed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.R. 36), legislation that would put an end to painful late-term abortion in America. I am a proud cosponsor and supporter of this legislation. I believe that life begins at conception and am committed to protecting the lives of the unborn, as well as their mothers. This legislation is a strong, commonsense step in the right direction. Preventing a Bad Deal with Iran For the past several months, the Obama administration has been negotiating a deal with Iran, offering to lift U.S. sanctions in exchange for the promise of a nuclear-free Iran. The Constitution makes clear that Congress has a vital role to play in foreign policy decisions. That's why I supported the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (H.R. 1191), which passed the House on Thursday. This legislation gives Congress the power to review (and possibly reject) the President's nuclear deal with Iran before any Congressional sanctions against Iran can be waived or suspended. We simply cannot allow Iran to develop a nuclear weapon. A bad deal with Iran is a bad deal for the American people and the global community at large. Honoring our Heroes in Blue This past week, we recognized more than 900,000 law enforcement officers across the United States who risk their lives daily to protect and serve our communities. In honor of National Police Week, the House passed a series of bills to help ensure the safety of all officers, and to support officers who have been injured or killed in the line of duty as well as their families. Don't Tax our Fallen Public Safety Heroes Act (H.R. 606) This bill prohibits the federal government from taxing benefits given to surviving dependents of public safety officers who died in the line of duty. Defending Public Safety Employees' Retirement Act (H.R. 2146) H.R. 2146 allows federal public safety officers to access retirement savings at the age of 50 after 20 years of service without facing a 10% tax. Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu National Blue Alert Act (S. 665) In honor of NYPD officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu who were ambushed and killed last December, S. 665 creates a nationwide Blue Alert System that notifies citizens and other public officials when law enforcement officers have been threatened, injured, or killed, so violent criminals can be quickly apprehended. District Travels During the House's last district work period, I made several stops around Ohio's Second District: -Visited the Scioto Career Technical Center in Lucasville to chat with students and teachers about the programs they offer to prepare our young adults for today's workforce. -Stopped by Adena Home Care in Chillicothe to talk to administrators about a variety of issues facing our district's local home healthcare industry. -Attended the EmpowerU spring finale in Cincinnati, where I spoke about the national security threats we face in the 21st Century, from terrorism to cybersecurity, and the future of our military and role in the world. Ensuring a Strong National Defense Answering 21st Century threats with 21st Century capabilities for our military The Constitution tasks Congress with providing for the common defense, a responsibility I take very seriously. That's why I was proud to support the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which passed the House on Friday. The world is not getting any safer. This legislation will ensure the Department of Defense is operating efficiently, and will provide the resources our Armed Forces need to face current threats and prepare for new ones.

[R-AL2]","News from Representative Martha Roby Martha Roby top banner  CONNECT WITH ME facebook  youtube  tweeter  Go to my website  EMAIL UPDATE By subscribing to my email updates, you are authorizing me to send regular email updates from my office to your email account. Sign up  Friends, I'm pleased that in just a little over a week, my friend and colleague Congressman Trey Gowdy will be coming down to Alabama for a visit  . The event will take place in Millbrook at the Civic Center there right near the park on Thursday, May 28, at 10:30 a.m.  You know, Trey and I came into Congress the same year, and he is a great friend. But, since then he has grown such a huge following throughout the country for being a leading conservative voice for government reform. So, I asked him if he would come down to Central Alabama so my constituents could get a chance to meet him and hear from him. So I hope people from the River Region will come out to have a cup of coffee and hear from Trey Gowdy about conservative government reform and the need for strong Congressional oversight. If you're interested in attending, go to my Facebook page  for more details. Hope you can join us! Important Update for Alabama's Farmers, Foresters: If you're a farmer or a forester, you probably know that federal water regulators  have been trying to greatly expand their reach into private lands by seeking to make small ponds, puddles and ditches subject to strict federal regulations. But, many Americans might not be aware of this federal government scheme to erode property rights and encroach private lands. Since its enactment in the 1970s, the Clean Water Act's scope of authority to regulate waterways has been limited to ""navigable waters,"" which are labeled ""Waters of the United States."" Smaller, non-navigable, more remote waters have always been the jurisdiction of state and local governments. But now, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers have proposed a new rule redefining ""Waters of the United States"" to include all manner of small areas where water collects, or could collect, such as ditches, puddles and even decorative ponds. Not surprisingly, this proposal has been met with strong opposition from Republicans and Democrats alike. This past week, the House passed H.R. 1732, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act  , which blocks the proposed rule from going into effect. The bill instructs the EPA and the Corps to abandon their current proposed rule and start the rule making process over, seeking input from those who would be affected: state and local governments, farmers and private landowners, among others. This is a big win for Alabama's farmers and foresters  , and I'm pleased to share this news, especially with so many of you who have contacted my office with concerns. VA Misspends Billions in Waste, Fraud, Abuse: Remember two weeks ago when the President and Veterans Affairs Secretary accused appropriators of cutting VA spending  by $1.4 billion? Well it turns out that at least $6 billion has been misspent annually in waste, fraud and abuse by the Department of Veterans Affairs, according to a report by the Washington Post  .  This just shows how ridiculous and petty the President and VA Secretary's rhetoric has been. While the VA Secretary falsely accused House Republicans  of cutting funding and the President threatened to veto our appropriations bill over $1.4 billion, the VA was actually blowing through 4 times that annually in misspent funds. They need to spend less time on political posturing and more time on correcting the ongoing mismanagement of VA health care systems that is preventing our veterans from receiving timely, quality care. I continue to stay vigilant on this matter and am working on legislation to compel the VA Secretary to takeover VA systems that perpetually fail to meet basic standards. The Week Ahead: We have a busy legislative week ahead of us, and I'm particularly proud of a number of bills passed tonight to support our veterans. Too many of our service men and women struggle to find good-paying, sustainable jobs once they return home. That's why it's important for us to do what we can to support those who have so selflessly served our country. One bill, H.R. 1382  or the ""BRAVE Act,"" does just that by allowing the VA Secretary to give preference to government contractors who employ veterans on a full time basis. Another, H.R. 474  or the ""Homeless Veterans' Reintegration Programs Reauthorization Act of 2015,"" provides grant money for job training programs through community organizations. We also voted on H.R. 1038  , a bill to require the Secretary to keep on file all written reprimands that a VA employee has received as long as they work for the Department. This commonsense legislation will help prevent wrongdoing and mismanagement at VA facilities, like that in Central Alabama, from being continuously swept under the rug. I encourage you to take a closer look at these and other bills on the agenda  for this week: * H.R. 1313  - Service Disabled Veteran Owned Small Business Relief Act * H.R. 91  - Veteran's I.D. Card Act * H.R. 1816  - Vulnerable Veterans Housing Reform Act of 2015 * S. 178  - Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act of 2015 * H.R. 2353  - Highway and Transportation Funding Act of 2015 * H.R. 2250  - Legislative Branch Appropriations Act, 2016 * H.R. 880  - American Research and Competitiveness Act of 2015 * H.R. 1806  - America COMPETES Reauthorization Act of 2015 * H.R. 2262  - SPACE Act of 2015 Stay in Touch You can keep up with the latest news by finding me on Facebook  and Twitter  where I post updates daily.

[R-FL10]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email   Webster Wire Listening to Central Florida Dear Friends:  I was honored to participate in a groundbreaking ceremony for U.S. Army Captain Robert Withers last weekend. This home will be built and paid for by Homes for Our Troops, a not-for-profit organization committed to providing homes for members of the military who were wounded in action. While serving as a Platoon Leader in Afghanistan nearly five years ago, Captain Withers stepped on an anti-personnel mine that launched him into the air and severed large portions of his legs. After multiple surgeries over many long months, and losing his right leg below the knee, Captain Withers has chosen to make his home in Winter Garden. It will be a pleasure to have him in the West Orange community. _________________________  Last week was National Police Week, and I was honored to recognize the brave men and women who enforce our laws and keep our communities safe. I have made it a point to sit down with most of the police chiefs and many of the law enforcement officers within our Congressional district to hear about their involvement in our community and thank them for the work they do to uphold our system of law and order. These public servants selflessly dedicate their lives to keep us safe, and I am grateful for their sacrifices for our safety. _________________________  Saturday was Armed Forces Day, and it was a pleasure to thank members of our military who have sacrificed and fought to protect our liberties. For 239 years, the men and women of our Armed Forces have been a shining beacon of freedom throughout the world. Because of their sacrifices, we are able to stand as free and grateful Americans. I was privileged to join the East Lake County Historical Society as they coordinated a heritage festival to remember our history and celebrate Armed Forces Day. _________________________  Graduation season has arrived, and I spoke at two commencement ceremonies this weekend. One was for a homeschool group in Winter Garden that had a group of 8 high school graduates. Thirty years ago, in 1985, I sponsored legislation as a member of the state legislature that ensures the rights of Florida parents to teach their children at home. Following that, I worked to allow homeschool students to participate in the Florida High School Athletic Association, as well as quality for merit scholarships and dual enrollment in Floridas community college system. I was privileged to pilot the program that became Florida Virtual School, and continue to be a strong advocate for homeschool issues and further academic choice and opportunity. _________________________  On Saturday, the Town of Oakland hosted their Celebration Among the Oaks, including a ribbon cutting for their new water plant and planting trees in honor of Arbor Day. The Bloom and Grow Garden Society donated the trees, and it was a pleasure to help shovel the dirt for them as Oakland continues to look forward to the growth and success of their community in West Orange County. _________________________  During my time in Washington last week, I met with several groups to hear about issues that are concerning to members of our community. Some of the constituents that traveled to Washington included: *  Members of the Florida, Orange and Polk County Farm Bureaus * Joe Lewis, the General Manager of Mount Dora Boating Center and Marina * Local representatives from the Financial Services Institute * Florida members of the National Association of Realtors * The Florida Trucking Association It is an honor to represent you in the United States House of Representatives. Your servant,  Daniel Webster Member of Congress     Constituent Corner Recently, a constituent from Polk City contacted my office regarding an issue with the Social Security Administration (SSA). Several months ago, the constituent had moved to Central Florida from New York, but was experiencing issues updating her residency, resulting in a loss of eligibility for her Medicaid benefits. My office reached out to SSA on her behalf, and they were able to update their records to reflect her Florida residency. When we followed up with the constituent, she confirmed that her issue with SSA was resolved, and was thankful for our assistance. Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you. Survey Last week, a jury delivered the death sentence to Boston marathon bomber, Dzhokhar Tsarnaev. Given the danger of lone wolf terrorist threats, do you support the use of the death penalty in federal capital cases involving domestic terrorism? * Yes, I support the death penalty in federal cases involving domestic terrorism  . * No, I don't support the death penalty in federal cases like this  . Submit your Response  Response from the previous survey question  , ""Do you believe that the IRS should continue to be thoroughly examined and held accountable, specifically for the way they treat non-profit entities seeking tax exemption?"" Yes - 88% No - 11% I don't know - 1% Legislative Update There were several substantial pieces of legislation in Washington this week, including: * Restricting the National Security Agencys collection of American phone data, H.R. 2048  , Uniting and Strengthening America by Fulfilling Rights and Ensuring Effective Discipline Over Monitoring (USA FREEDOM) Act of 2015 * Authorizing our military and Department of Defense programs, H.R. 1735  National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 * Protecting babies during late term pregnancy and final development, H.R. 36  , the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act The House also considered H.R. 1191  , the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015, which I voted against. When addressing a joint meeting of Congress earlier this year, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu argued passionately that when it comes to ongoing U.S. negotiations with Iran over their pursuit of a nuclear weapon, no deal is better than a bad deal.

POLL OF THE WEEK Country of Origin Labeling (COOL) is a requirement signed into American law under Title X of the Farm Security and Rural Investment Act of 2002  (known as the 2002 Farm Bill). This law requires retailers to label fresh beef, pork, and lamb so as to tell the consumer which country the meat came from. The Canadian federal government argued before the WTO that American ""country of origin"" labelling rules (COOL) actually worked to the detriment of the meat industry on both sides of the border by increasing costs, lowering processing efficiency, and otherwise distorting trade across the Canada-U.S. border. Mexico made similar claims. On Monday the World Trade Organization again sided with Canada and Mexico in their final challenge of the COOL law, allowing these countries to seek retaliation for billions of dollars in damages and paving the way for these countries to impose steep tariffs on our goods. Canada has issued a preliminary retaliation list targeting various commodities and manufactured products that would affect every state in the U.S. Missouri alone could face tariffs ranging from $623 million on exports  including beef, spirits, machine parts, and prepared foods COOL supporters have called for a more generic North American label or legislative changes to make it WTO compliant, arguing the law is about a consumers right to know where their food is produced, allowing Canada and Mexico to impose heavy tariffs on American products going forward. Those who have been opposed to the law have called for a quick repeal of COOL to avoid costly retaliatory tariffs that could impact billions of other U.S. agricultural products and result in an even costlier prolonged trade war with our two largest partners. Question of the Week: Should Congress repeal the COOL law? Yes, Congress should repeal the COOL law. No, Congress should not repeal the COOL law.

On Sunday, the Philadelphia Inquirer ran a joint op-ed I coauthored with by my colleague  Rep. Ryan Costello. The op-ed lays out some of the issues rampant within the Philadelphia VA benefits office, and some of the steps weve taken to address them. We learned Tuesday of the tragic Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia, which cost eight lives and injured many more. We also saw the heroism of so many on the scene, not just the first responders but also the passengers on the train who put themselves at risk to help their fellow travelers escape the wreckage. I shared some of my thoughts on the tragedy with the Delaware County Daily Times.  The end of the week saw passage of two more measures important to Americas security. A bipartisan defense bill provides our men and women in uniform the resources necessary to protect our interests, and it improves the pay and benefits for our troops. It also contains a provision at my request that will expand the role of the V-22 Osprey  , built by workers at Boeings facility in Ridley Park, Delaware County. The Senate is expected to take up companion legislation in the coming weeks. The House also approved a bill that will give Congress the opportunity to review any final nuclear deal with Iran. A nuclear Iran would be a grave threat to American security, our Israeli allies and the entire region and this bill will give Congress the chance to stop a bad deal. The Senate passed mirroring legislation two weeks ago with an overwhelming 98-1 vote, and it now goes to the President for his signature. Thank you for the honor of serving you.

[R-CA23]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email   Home  Help Center  Our District  About Kevin  On the Issues  Media  Majority Leader  Contact  Dear Lindsey, Former CIA Deputy Director Mike Morrell recently said that, I've never seen more threats to our country at any one time in my 33 years in the business. Unfortunately, as America has pulled back from the world stage, other nations that often reject our values have filled the void. That has led to instability from Russia to the Middle East. Now is not the time for America to withdraw and approach national security as a second priority. One of Congresss most important constitutional responsibilities is to provide for the common defense. That is why the House of Representatives last week passed three major bills to support and reform our military, provide oversight on Iran nuclear negotiations, and extend and reform our national intelligence capabilities. *** Last summer we watched in horror as ISIS brutally murdered innocent American journalists and aid workers. Since then, their terror has spread to numerous countries throughout the region as they have preyed on vulnerable and disenfranchised individuals to travel and join their delusional fight. This has led to an unknown number of ISIS fighters that hold western passports. Even here at home, there have been a number of instances of Americans seeking to join ISIS. In the face of these threats, it is imperative our national security agencies have the tools necessary to identify and thwart potential terror threats. The USA Freedom Act balances privacy and security to make sure civil liberties are protected while our intelligence community still has the tools it needs to protect our homeland from terrorism. As we stay vigilant at home and abroad against the war on terror, there is a larger and more global threat to peace and freedomIrans ability to build a nuclear bomb. Right now, I believe this Administration is barreling toward an agreement with Iran that disregards the will of our greatest ally in the region, Israel, as well as our partners in the Gulf region such as Saudi Arabia. I have said that any nuclear deal with Iran must guarantee peace AND freedom. You cannot have one without the other. That is why it is critical Congress have the ability to approve or disapprove a potential deal. The House approved this check and balance on the President last week. But as we address these threats in addition to Russias aggression in Eastern Europe and Chinas provocative actions in the South China Sea, our military must have the resources, flexibility, and capabilities it needs to keep America safe and defend our interests abroad. This responsibility falls to Congress every year and last week, the House passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), which authorizes full funding of our military while cutting needless waste by instituting reforms to the Department of Defenses costly acquisitions process. Our communities play an integral role in our military readiness and this bill supports our installations and the men and women who serve on them. The world is a more dangerous place than it was just a few years ago. Our allies dont trust us and our enemies dont fear us. Now, we must do everything we can to keep America safe and strong. These bills will strengthen our ability to protect our homeland from those who would attack us and defend our interests abroad in an even more uncertain world.

,114,Male,N00027523,43440,"Sires, Albio (Rep.) [D-NJ8]","Dear Friend, I advocated for the people of the 8th District last week by attending several committee hearings, discussing important topics with several industry groups from the Garden State, and meeting with government officials. I am deeply saddened by last week's derailment of the regional Amtrak train that occurred just outside of Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, which tragically killed eight people and injured over 200. As a frequent rider of this Amtrak route, I understand how horrifying this incident is for those in New Jersey and for everyone who uses this line for their own transportation. My thoughts are with the families of those affected by this tragedy. I commend the first responders for their quick response and have faith that the National Transportation Safety Board will proceed with a thorough investigation to provide the public with answers. On Wednesday, I attended the Transportation and Infrastructure's Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials hearing regarding the Staggers Rail Act. This law enabled individual railroad lines to adjust their rates and tailor their services to meet shippers' needs. As a result of this legislation, the health and vitality of the railroad industry has improved significantly since 1980. The transportation industry plays an important role in the 8th District's economy: 1 in 8 jobs is directly affected by the shipping industry. The Foreign Affairs Committee held several hearings last week regarding important international issues. The first hearing discussed the state of religious minority communities in Iraq and Syria where ISIS has unjustly taken over. The Committee then held a hearing on U.S. economic interests in Asia. Important questions were asked regarding human rights concerns in the region, how China is influencing American business interests in the area, and how to increase American exports to the region. Finally, I attended a Western Hemisphere Subcommittee hearing to examine the current opportunities and challenges regarding energy policy in the Western Hemisphere. I had the pleasure of meeting with Hoboken Mayor Dawn Zimmer last week to discuss ongoing infrastructure projects in Hoboken, notably the ""Complete Streets"" redesign of Washington Street. Mayor Zimmer discussed the city's application for a Transportation Investment Generating Economic Recovery (TIGER) grant to complete the Washington Street project. TIGER grants are awarded by the U.S. Department of Transportation to fund capital investments in surface transportation infrastructure and have a significant impact on crucial roadways across the United States. Visiting last week from the Economic Development Administration (EDA) was Assistant Secretary Jay Williams, who briefed me on the EDA's plans for the coming year. The EDA is an agency in the United States Department of Commerce that provides grants and technical assistance to economically distressed communities in order to generate new employment, help retain existing jobs, and stimulate industrial and commercial growth through a variety of investment programs. A few groups representing residents of the 8th District visited last week. The International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers (IAM) from Local Lodge 914 in Newark stopped by to discuss the importance of protecting American workers. Also visiting last week were members of NORPAC, who came to discuss the importance of preventing Iran from having the ability to create a nuclear weapon and the importance of our nation's strong relationship with Israel.

[R-MI10]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email  News from Representative Candice Miller  May 18, 2015 In Case You Missed It: Macomb Daily: A-10s too vital to decommission  By Rep. Candice Miller  spacer The U.S. House of Representatives has again approved legislation sparing the A-10 Thunderbolt (aka Warthog) from extinction, voting Friday to continue funding for the A-10 fleet through 2016. Thats the good news. The bad news is that powerful forces, including the Obama administration and top officials from the U.S. Air Force, still want it gone. Without identifying any suitable replacement to fill its role as the pre-eminent close air support (CAS) aircraft in the American arsenal. If only our leadership was as indefatigable, resolute and reliable as the A-10 itself. The National Defense Authorization Act approved with bi-partisan support Friday should send a clear message to the naysayers that until the Pentagon demonstrates it has developed an alternative to the A-10, and its unparalleled ability to protect ground troops engaged in close combat, the Warthog isnt going anywhere (except, when required, to the battlefield). I adamantly supported the A-10 authorization in this years defense bill, as I have repeatedly in recent years. The reasons for my advocacy are readily articulated. Some might suggest they are provincial, related to the presence of an A-10 unit at Selfridge Air National Guard Base in Harrison Township. They are correct; I am fiercely proud of the men and women who make up the 107th Fighter Squadron, 127th Aircraft Maintenance Squadron, 127th Maintenance Squadron and 127th Operations Support Squadron, currently on deployment to combat the vile and nihilistic forces of the so-called Islamic State in Iraq and Syria. But my support has less to do with their geographic location than a heartfelt awe at the willingness of our fellow citizens to answer their nations call to defend civilization and liberty. More importantly, the A-10 is, at the present time, uniquely qualified to provide a key component of that defense. As U.S. Rep. Martha McSally, R-Arizona, herself a former A-10 pilot and the first female combat fighter pilot in U.S. history, has pointed out there are currently no other aircraft available to perform the duties tasked to the Warthog. With its weaponry, maneuverability and capacity to operate in adverse weather and battlefield conditions, the A-10 is the best support aircraft for ground troops on the planet. In 2013, McSally, who flew 325 combat hours in the A-10 in Iraq and Afghanistan, said: When American troops find themselves in precarious position on the battlefield, there is no better sound than the rumbling engines of an A-10 bringing its 30 mm guns to bear. Pumping out 1,174 rounds with incredible accuracy, it can literally mean the difference between life and death for troops who are pinned down. As I suggested to my colleagues in the debate over mothballing the A-10 a year ago, dont make a decision yes or no before speaking to someone who served on the ground in our recent wars. For now, the House has assured the preservation of our most reliable ground support aircraft. I remain hopeful that bi-partisan support in Congress for the A-10 will prevail. Michigans two Democratic senators have both said they oppose efforts to retire the A-10 before an adequate replacement becomes available. I am also encouraged that Republican U.S. Sen. John McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, has expressed support for the A-10. Until legislation preserving the Warthog is signed by the president, however, we should heed the words of former Air Force pilot Tony Carr, who pointed out the irony of all this is that the nations foremost enemies are actually hoping the Air Force wins this debate. Theyd like nothing more than to have A-10 off the battlefield. Candice Miller is the U.S. Representative for Michigans 10th district. ###   CONNECT WITH US     Washington D.C.

,114,Male,N00027462,43461,"Bilirakis, Gus (Rep.) [R-FL12]","21st Century Cures     facebook  twitter  you tube  3/17/2015 1 in 10  This week, I voted in favor of the 21st Century Cures draft legislation in the Health Subcommittee. This draft includes a number of provisions I have authored and supported, and I am happy to say the bill passed unanimously. We need to find new ways to drive innovation in health care. In addition to adequately funding the National Institutes of Health, which is included in this draft bill, we need to think critically and make structural changes to our health care system. It is imperative to reexamine what weve been doing and how were doing it, and this is what 21st Century Cures is giving us: an opportunity to address some of the structural barriers to new cures and fresh ways to incentivize developments. This bill has the potential to save and improve the lives of tens of millions of Americans, and I am pleased we have come together to get this done. I am proud to have sponsored the OPEN Act, a bill to incentivize drugmakers and innovators to repurpose major market drugs for life-threatening rare diseases and pediatric cancers, opening the door to the development of hundreds of safe, effective, and affordable treatments for rare disease patients. This bill is one of the main provisions in the 21st Century Cures legislation. Individually, each rare disease impacts less than 200,000 people. With such a small patient population, rare diseases hardly gain the attention that more widespread diseases such as cancer or heart disease garner. When viewed collectively, however, 30 million Americans suffer from a rare disease. Thats about 1 in 10 people. That is more people than the entire population of Florida, which has nearly 20 million residents. Rare diseases are not a rare problem, and they cannot be overlooked. There are over 7,000 rare diseases, 95 percent of which have no FDA-approved cures or treatments. This leaves rare disease patients with little hope and few, if any, alternatives for treatments and cures. The OPEN Act can help millions of people by ensuring medications are safe and effective for rare conditions. If you want to know more about it, click here to read an op-ed I wrote  about the OPEN Act, published on Thursday. You can click here  to watch a video in which my colleagues Chairman Pitts and Ranking Member Pallone join me in speaking in support of the OPEN Act. Other initiatives I authored in the 21st Century Cures draft legislation include: * A provision based on H.R. 2298, the Medicare Patient Safety and Drug Abuse Prevention Act, to establish a drug management program, which prevents high-risk beneficiaries from abusing controlled substances. This drug management program will monitor the prescribing and dispensing of controlled substances for at-risk beneficiaries to prevent prescription drug abuse and drug diversion. It is a commonsense measure utilized by private industry, TRICARE, and state Medicaid programs; * A provision based on H.R. 2299, the Medicare Site of Service Price Transparency Act, to provide seniors with transparency in Medicare Parts A and B, by allowing seniors to better identify the out of pocket costs they might face for a given treatment or service, and site of services that is right for them and their budgets; and * A provision based on questions Representative Bilirakis asked FDA  , which would require FDA to conclude overdue guidance on combination products. I am also an original cosponsor of a provision, authored by Representative Burgess, which would create a national data collection system for neurological diseases, including Parkinsons disease. Nearly 1 million people in the United States live with Parkinsons disease, and better data would pave the path to better treatments. I proudly serve as the Co-Chair of the Parkinsons Caucus, and Parkinsons Action Network has endorsed this provision. COVER Our Veterans  This week, the House Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Health passed my bill, the Creating Options for Veterans Expedited Recovery (COVER) Act unanimously. While it is vital that Veterans receive the care they need, it is equally important to recognize that one size does not fit all when discussing treatments for Veterans. The invisible wounds they sustained serving our country are just as serious as the physical ones. Many Veterans may thrive under traditional plans and medical care, but some may not be as responsive. We need to provide Veterans with choices, and easy access to alternative forms of therapies that work best for them. The COVER Act provides a pathway forward that will eventually allow Veterans to have a range of options for mental health treatments such as outdoor sports therapy, hyperbaric oxygen therapy, accelerated resolution therapy, and service dog therapy. This bill is a top priority of mine. I will continue to work to see it passed in the full VA Committee and in the House of Representatives. Police Week  This past week was National Police Week. Every day law enforcement officers put their lives on the line to keep our communities safe. Sadly, in my District, Tarpon Springs Police Officer Charles ""Charlie K"" Kondek was shot and killed right before Christmas as he patrolled the streets on the midnight shift, while the rest of us slept securely in our homes. I spoke about the importance of law enforcement officers and the loss of Officer Kondek on the House floor, and you can watch that here.  Melanoma and Skin Cancer Detection and Prevention Month  May is Melanoma and Skin Cancer Detection and Prevention Month. One person dies of melanoma every hour. There will be over 73,000 new cases of invasive melanoma in the US this year. Early detection is crucial to prevention. This week, I took the opportunity to highlight a very brave constituent of mine, McKenna Fitzpatrick.  She is a brave fourth grader, melanoma survivor, and a testament to the virtue of early detection. Williams Syndrome May is also Williams Syndrome Awareness Month. According to the Williams Syndrome Association, there are between twenty-five and thirty thousand individuals living with this rare disease  at least one of whom is a constituent of mine, Brian Weaver. In addition to seeing the OPEN Act included in legislation that passed the Health Subcommittee, I spoke on the House floor about the importance of studying Williams Syndrome.  Research into Williams Syndrome could lead to advances in treating Americans with high blood pressure, diabetes, autism, and anxiety disorders.

This month marks two years after Kermit Gosnell was found guilty for the senseless and horrific actions of delivering and then killing infants born alive. And as a lifelong supporter of the unborn, I was proud to support legislation that would ban abortions past 20 weeks. The legislation, which overwhelmingly passed the House, would ban abortions past 20 weeks, with an exception for instances of rape, incest, or when the life of the mother is at stake. Last Congress, the Congressional Budget Office estimated this bill, if enacted, would save 2,750 lives each year. That is a staggering number of lives that could be saved with the enactment of this bill. What is even more alarming is the United States is one of only seven nations that allow elective, late-term abortions. That puts the United States in the same category as countries like Vietnam and North Korea. As a society, I believe it is our duty to speak for those who cannot speak for themselves and allow them the right to be born into the world. This legislation would ensure there are no more so-called doctors, like Gosnell, in offices who have no respect for the right to life. H.R. 36 isnt the only pro-life legislation the House has supported in the 114th Congress. In April of this year, I was proud to cast my vote in support of H.J.Res. 43, which would disapprove of the Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Act (RHNDA) passed by the District of Columbia Council, which would require all D.C. employers to provide health-care coverage for contraceptives and elective abortions. The House of Representatives is, and will continue, to work to protect human life and religious freedom. Ive said this time and again that I firmly believe that all human life is significant and deserves to be treated with the highest dignity and respect. As your voice in Congress, I will continue to limit the incidence of this cruelty by denying federal dollars to fund abortion procedures, ensuring pregnant women are fully informed on the development of their unborn child and supporting alternatives to abortion like counseling and adoption services.

Helping Nebraskans Deal With Federal Agencies Each year, my office helps thousands of Third District residents who have questions or need help cutting red tape at federal agencies. If you need assistance from my office, I encourage you to attend one of the constituent service events being hosted by my staff next week. A mobile office allows constituents to meet with my staff about federal issues and take advantage of the constituent services available through my office, such as assisting individuals with challenges they face while working with a federal agency, ordering flags flown over the U.S. Capitol and booking tours in Washington, D.C. Caseworker in Your Community is an opportunity for constituents to meet directly with one of my congressional caseworkers. Caseworkers may be able to assist constituents who are having problems dealing with a federal agency such as the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs, Social Security, Medicare, passports and visas through the U.S. Department of State, U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, or the Internal Revenue Service. Here are the dates, times and locations for next week's events: Monday, May 18: Mobile Offices Sheridan County Courthouse 301 East 2nd Street, Rushville, NE 69360 10:00 a.m. to 11:00 a.m. (MDT) Scotts Bluff County Courthouse 1725 10th Street, Gering, NE 69341 5:30 p.m. to 6:30 p.m. (MDT) Tuesday, May 19: Mobile Offices Banner County Courthouse 204 State Street, Harrisburg, NE 69345 9:30 a.m. to 10:30 a.m. (MDT) Kimball County Courthouse 114 East 3rd Street, Kimball, NE 69145 11:30 a.m. to 12:30 p.m. (MDT) Thursday, May 21: Caseworker in Your Community Falls City Library & Arts Center First Study Room 1400 Stone Street, Falls City, NE 10:00 a.m. to 12:00 p.m. (CDT) Auburn Memorial Library Meeting Room 1810 Courthouse Avenue, Auburn, NE 1:00 p.m. to 3:00 p.m. (CDT) For additional information, please contact my Grand Island office at (308) 384-3900 or my Scottsbluff office at (308) 633-6333.

There is still much to do in Washington for you, my constituents. At the same time, it is so important to stay in touch with each corner I am honored to represent, from Kansas City, Independence, Lee's Summit, Raytown, Grandview, Sugar Creek, Blue Springs, Grain Valley, Oak Grove, North Kansas City, Gladstone, Claycomo, to all of Ray, Lafayette, and Saline Counties. Let me share with you a few highlights from this busy, bustling district work period. On Monday, I was honored to join CLARCORP at the groundbreaking of their finished plant expansion project in Lee's Summit. Together with Keith White, President of CLARCORP; Chris Ferraro, VP CLARCORP; John Reuss, VP CLARCORP and Mayor of Lee's Summit Randy Rhoads, I helped cut the ribbon to mark this new beginning. The Lee's Summit CLARCORP plant manufactures packing materials for military and public applications. This truly fits into what we need to be doing in our district and around the country  making it in America. We must strengthen American manufacturing and help businesses grow and create jobs here. This way, we can set our country on a solid path toward greater economic competitiveness, job creation, and long-term economic growth. On Wednesday, this year's National Bike to School Day, I visited Whittier Elementary in the Historic Northeast to highlight bike safety and student health. I rode up 10th street with Dr. Green, KCPS Superintendent, Jermaine Reed, 3rd District Councilman, Luis Hinojosa, Whittier Elementary Principal and several students from Whittier. As a father and grandfather, I could not help but share a bit of advice: always eat healthy foods and wear helmets when you ride your bikes. The first-ever National Bike to School Day took place on May 9, 2012, in coordination with the League of American Bicyclists' National Bike Month. Together, we can maintain a healthy lifestyle, protect our environment, and enjoy the outdoors. And yesterday, on Thursday, I was delighted to be with my friends at The Crown in Odessa to celebrate the National Day of Prayer. Presidents Harry Truman, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton signed laws to designate and recognize the National Day of Prayer. This year, President Obama followed that tradition and designated May 6, 2015, as our National Day of Prayer. As an ordained United Methodist Minister, it will be no surprise to you that I was in my element. In this day and age it is important for all of us take time to pray and reflect.

It sounds ridiculous, but each year the federal government spends BILLIONS of dollars making improper payments to the deceased. All because agencies don't have full access to the complete list of who has died. I've introduced a common-sense plan to put a stop to this ridiculous practice once and for all. The Stopping Improper Payments to Deceased People Act would allow all federal agencies access to the Death Master File, the most complete information on who has died. Currently, only a small number of federal agencies have access to this official list, and most federal agencies rely on a slimmed down, incomplete and less timely version of the file. For example, the Office of Personnel Management Inspector General reported that $601 million in improper payments were made to federal retirees found to have died over the previous five years. And that's just one agency! I believe firmly that cutting government waste like this is a good place to start strengthening our nation's fiscal footing.

,114,Male,N00033720,43686,"Allen, Rick (Rep.) [R-GA12]","Friend, Today, the House acted to carry out Congress' first constitutional responsibility of providing for the common defense. It was an honor to cast my vote in favor of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2016, which supports our troops and their critical missions, including operations at Fort Gordon in Augusta. This NDAA will help keep our military strong and Americans safe. Americans deserve to feel secure in their homes. This bill supports our military to bolster national defense at home and abroad. I also spoke on the House floor this week in support of legislation to stop the EPA's flawed ""Waters of the United States"" (WOTUS) rule. If not stopped, the WOTUS rule would give the federal government authority to regulate virtually any place where water flows in the United States. This is unacceptable overreach, and I'm pleased the House passed legislation, which I cosponsored, to stop this rule from taking effect. We have a responsibility to defend innocent lives of the most vulnerable. Thats why I proudly cosponsored the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which the House passed this week. This bill protects unborn children from abortion after five months, the point at which they can feel pain. I will always fight for the right to life from conception and am grateful the House approved this bill to stop painful late-term abortions, save lives, and give a voice to those who cannot speak for themselves. Another national security bill the House approved this week is the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. After its recent passage in the Senate, the measure is on its way to becoming law, ensuring any potential nuclear deal with Iran is reviewed by Congress. Not only will this allow Congress to stop a bad deal with Iran, it also gives the American people the opportunity to weigh in. This week brought strong progress in advancing solutions that protect Americans and hold the federal government more accountable. With your help and input, I look forward to continuing to work on these and other issues important to Georgians in the 12th district. Sincerely, Rick Rick W.

,114,Female,N00031539,43577,"Black, Diane (Rep.) [R-TN6]","   Contact Me  | Serving You  | Media Center  | Legislative Work  | Our District  | Resources  They Can't Ignore the Facts from The Washington Times  By Diane Black May 14, 2015 When I became a nurse more than 40 years ago, I took a vow to ""devote myself to the welfare of those committed to my care"" but, initially, our understanding of science limited the extent to which I could fulfill that promise. During my first years of nursing, if a woman came into my hospital in labor at 32 weeks of pregnancy, our odds for saving her child were slim. However, today babies are being saved as early as 22 weeks into fetal development, according to a study cited just last week in The New York Times. What's more, there is significant evidence that by 20 weeks of development, unborn children have the capacity to feel pain. This is why anesthesia is used in fetal surgeries and special care is given to reduce the pain of premature infants placed in neonatal intensive care. Sadly, while we celebrate advances in technology that prove life has value and worth before leaving the hospital, we also continue to be one of only seven nations that allow elective, late-term abortions - putting the United States in the same category as countries like Vietnam and North Korea. It is difficult to imagine a more important measure of a society than how it treats its most innocent and defenseless population. By condoning the destruction of unborn life that could otherwise live outside the womb, the United States tragically fails to meet this most fundamental human rights standard. Basic decency and human compassion demands that something has to change. Polls consistently show that upward of 60 percent of Americans support putting an end to the dangerous and inhumane practice of late-term abortions. Those numbers will only increase as hearts and minds are made aware of the pain that these babies experience during abortion and the evidence supporting their viability at increasingly early stages of development. To that end, the House of Representatives voted to pass the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act this week, which will provide federal legal protection for unborn children at 20 weeks, with exceptions to save the life of the mother or in cases of rape and incest. The House passage of the bill coincides with the anniversary of the conviction of the infamous abortionist Kermit Gosnell. This is the man who savagely killed babies born alive in his ""clinic"" and is responsible for the death of an adult woman. Americans were rightfully outraged when told of his crimes, but the truth is that innocent, unborn children routinely suffer the same fate as Gosnell's victims through ""normal"" late-term abortions and the government does not bat an eye. The only difference between these casualties and the loss of life that resulted in Gosnell's murder conviction is location. While Pain Capable garnered some bipartisan support, too many of my colleagues across the aisle still continue to side with the big-abortion lobby over the innocent lives at stake in this debate. Knowing that premature babies are being saved as early as 22 weeks into fetal development, there is no legitimate reason to oppose this bill. After all, Democrats are quick to brand conservatives as ""science deniers"" on a host of other issues, so why would they choose to ignore the overwhelming scientific consensus in this debate? If we cannot appeal to Democratic lawmakers' sense of compassion when it comes to late-term abortion, then surely we can at least appeal to their sense of logic and fact. In the year 2015, the United States has no business aborting the lives of babies who can live outside the womb. Science agrees, and so do the majority of Americans. The Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act will right this wrong. Read Congressman Black's op-ed as it originally appeared in The Washington Times HERE  .

,114,Male,N00031377,43535,"Labrador, Raúl (Rep.) [R-ID1]","Congressman Raul Labrador, Representing the 1st District of Idaho Dear Friends, Today, I spoke on the floor of the U.S. House of Representatives in memory of Sgt. Greg Moore, who was shot and killed while doing his job to protect the citizens of Coeur dAlene. Sgt. Moore is among 71 Idaho peace officers who have died in the line of duty. His name will be added to the Idaho Peace Officer Memorial in Meridian at next years Peace Officers Memorial Day ceremony. Here is the tribute I submitted into the Congressional Record: I come to the floor today on Peace Officers Memorial Day to acknowledge and honor the life and service of Coeur dAlene Police Sgt. Greg Moore.Sgt. Moore was shot and killed in the line of duty May 5, 2015. Gregory King Moore was born in Walla Walla, Wash. He attended Walla Walla High School and Walla Walla Community College before moving to Idaho to attend the University of Idaho.After graduating from the University of Idaho he joined the Asotin County Sheriffs Department before transferring to the Coeur dAlene Police Department. During his tenure at the Coeur dAlene Police Department he served as a Patrol Officer, Field Training Officer, and School Resource Officer. I did not have the pleasure of knowing Sgt. Moore personally.But the outpouring of support from his community tells me much about his character and service.More than 4,000 people attended his funeral, including officers from across Idaho, as well as Washington, Montana and Canada.This outpouring of support warmed my heart and reminded me of the goodness of the people of Idaho. I hope this public support was comforting to Sgt. Moores family. Sgt. Moores 12-year-old son Dylon wrote these words to honor his father: My dad was the best. He would tell me anything, and was always there for me. All the times I was sad or lonely, he would be right by my side to comfort me. Dad would also reassure me that he was OK going to work by telling me he was Batman, because he worked at night, had lots of gadgets, was skilled and charming. Also, wherever we went, he would know someone that was there. I would always wonder how and why he knew those people. Dads favorite place to eat was Qdoba. It ended up being my favorite place as well. He was a Boston fan and he has gone to a couple of games, but I know he would have liked to see more. Every day, though, almost like tradition, we would wrestle on the ground, and try to beat each other. Ive only won once, but I have learned so many things from him. I love him so much because he was a good dad, always helping people. And I want everyone to know that he is the best. Coeur dAlene Police Chief Lee White said, Greg was part of a proud profession, and an even prouder police department. Greg did things right. He was a leader, he was a supervisor, and he was not satisfied sitting at a desk. In the end, and the reason were here today, is that he personified the oath that we take when we raise our right hand and were sworn in. Greg was killed protecting the life and property and way of life of the citizens of Coeur dAlene, Idaho. He will never be forgotten. Throughout Idaho hundreds of vehicles are now displaying a decal that reads K27 in honor of Sergeant Moores call number.I would like to add my voice to those that honored Sergeant Moore by closing with phrase that had passed over the lips of those thousands who have honored Sergeant Moore over the past week. K27 rest in peace. Sgt. Moore is among 44 U.S. officers killed in the line of duty in 2015. Last year, 133 died. I hope youll join me in praying for Sgt. Moore, his family and the families of all fallen officers who sacrifice themselves in the name of public safety.

Most Americans were unaware that their own government was trampling on their Fourth Amendment rights. We've also learned that the NSA was acting far beyond the scope of what Congress authorized in the Patriot Act (Section 215) and in the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (Section 702). To address some of the misuse and abuse, the House passed H.R. 2048, the USA Freedom Act, this week. But, while this bill is an improvement over current law and a step in the right direction, it's not enough-that's why I voted against it. Under Section 702 of FISA, the government collects the content of an individual's calls, texts and emails - all without a warrant - and then later searches that information again without a warrant. Congress can and must do more to stop bulk data collection and protect the Fourth Amendment. I've introduced H.R. 2233, the End Warrantless Surveillance of Americans Act  , to prohibit warrantless searches of government databases for information that pertains to U.S. citizens. It also works to close loopholes (like ""back door"" searches) that allow government agencies to use commercial products for surveillance. In another effort to protect individual privacy, I introduced H.R. 2255 that would make the American Community Survey voluntary.  Under the Constitution, the federal government must conduct a census every ten years to account for the population, but that is all that is required. The Census Bureau has gone further, sending a mandatory survey called the American Community Survey to 3 million Americans each year. This survey asks intrusive, personal questions - like does anyone in your home have a mental illness? And what time do you come to and from work? -questions that if not answered, carry the weight of a criminal penalty. It's an abuse of power for the Federal Government to force Americans to divulge information that they feel uncomfortable providing and to penalize them if they refuse to respond.  This week is National Police Week, a week in which Americans gather to pay tribute to men and women who wear the badge and keep us safe. On Monday, I joined the City of Humble, Texas to host the first annual North Houston Police Memorial Day Ceremony. We gathered to remember the heroes we lost and to honor the heroes currently serving. Thank you to peace officers everywhere for the daily sacrifices you make to keep our communities safe.

senior,"112,113,114",Male,N00003845,402675,"Coats, Daniel (Sen.) [R-IN]","A message from Senator Dan Coats  Dear Friend, Thank you for signing up to receive my email newsletter. These newsletters will cover a variety of topics, including events happening in Indiana, legislation being considered in Congress, and my perspective on current issues. My hope is to keep you updated and informed on how issues in Washington may impact Hoosiers. I welcome your feedback. Thanks for reading, Dan Coats _____ Cutting Federal Spending on Printing and Travel In this week's installment of Waste of the Week, I discussed how federal agencies can achieve $10 billion in savings by reducing non-essential printing and travel costs. In remarks on the Senate floor, I called on all federal agencies and Congress to examine what is spent on printing, travel and vehicles. According to the National Commission on Fiscal Responsibility and Reform, we can achieve at least $10 billion in future savings by requiring federal agencies to eliminate and reprioritize spending in the areas of printing, travel and vehicles. When I served on the Senate Appropriations Committee, I secured appropriations language that encouraged federal agencies to submit a plan for reducing operating expenses by placing greater scrutiny on overhead costs. I asked these agencies to consider how savings could be achieved by reducing non-essential travel, office supplies, rent, and utility costs. While I have been heartened to see recent reductions in printing costs by some federal agencies, much, much more can be done. Indiana is a great example of success in this area. When Mitch Daniels was Indiana's Governor, he had an aide place pennies on the back tire of state-owned vehicles. Months later, the aide went to back see which of the pennies were still on the tires. If a penny remained, it indicated that the cars had not been driven. Roughly 2,500 unused state vehicles were sold off. This totaled about 1/3 of the state's fleet. As Congress begins working on fiscal year 2016 appropriations bills, I am proposing that Congress place language in these appropriations bills requiring all federal agencies to reduce spending in the areas of printing, travel and vehicles by ten percent. This effort is about prioritizing and economizing. Trimming waste and excess in these areas through a ten percent reduction will save at least $10 billion. _____ Commission to Fill Judicial Vacancies This week I called for the establishment of an Indiana Federal Nominating Commission to make recommendations on judicial vacancies in the Hoosier state. There are currently three such vacancies in Indiana: the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit, the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of Indiana and the United States Attorney for the Southern District of Indiana. An additional vacancy will arise on the U.S. District Court for the Northern District of Indiana upon Judge Robert Miller's transition to senior status in January 2016. Judicial selection commissions have a long history in Indiana. On November 21, 1980, Indiana Senators Richard Lugar and Dan Quayle formed the ""Indiana Merit Commission on Federal Judicial Appointments."" This commission recruited, interviewed, investigated and made final recommendations for federal appointments for over 20 years. At the state level, the seven member Judicial Nominating Commission currently recommends applicants to the Governor to fill vacancies on the Indiana Supreme Court, the Court of Appeals, and the Tax Court. We need to ensure that fair and qualified public servants with Hoosier common-sense are chosen for these important roles. The citizens of Indiana will be best served by a nomination process that is taken completely out of politics. I hope we can establish an equitable process for the remainder of this Congress that focuses on vacancies where workloads are most urgent.

[R-NC5]","Foxx Report for the Week of May 15, 2015 The right to life is the most fundamental of rights, and this week the House showed it will not sit idly by while the innocent and voiceless are subjected to the grotesque and brutal procedure that is late-term abortion. The science is clear. Unborn children at 20 weeks of development are individuals capable of experiencing great pain, and I was proud to support passage of the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would prohibit elective abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy. We go to extraordinary lengths in this country to save the lives of our fellow human beings because we value life so much. However, there are many who do not hold the unborn in the same esteem and that is tragic. Every life matters. It is my hope that a culture of life will take hold and all children will be protected in law in the near future. Telephone Town Hall On June 9th, I invite you to participate in a telephone town hall meeting where you will be able to get an update on my work in Washington and where I will take questions from residents of North Carolinas 5th Congressional District. Constituents will have the opportunity to participate either by calling in to the event or registering in advance to receive a phone call. Below are the details if you would like to join in the conversation: What: Telephone Town Hall Meeting Host: Congresswoman Virginia Foxx When: Tuesday, June 9, 7:15 p.m.  8:15 p.m. Call-In Number: 1-877-229-8493 (Passcode: 114272) Website Registration: Telephone town halls are one of the opportunities where the people I represent can share directly with me their concerns and ideas. I look forward to hearing your thoughts and questions. Waters of the United States In 2014, the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers issued a rule that would significantly broaden the federal governments power to regulate waters and adjacent lands under the Clean Water Act. The rule would have given the federal government jurisdiction over puddles, roadside ditches, irrigation ditches and storm and wastewater systems. Federal agencies frequently place burdensome regulations on the American public, and the Waters of the United States rule is no exception. On Tuesday I voted for legislation that would require the agencies to start over and develop a new rule in consultation with state and local governments and other stakeholders. This common sense legislation prevents an out-of-touch administration from threatening the livelihood of North Carolinas farmers and saddling local governments with exorbitant compliance costs. Providing for the Common Defense of the United States Providing for the common defense of the United States of America is the federal governments primary responsibility. This week the House passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, which maintains the nations defense readiness and ensures the continued success of our military personnel by providing them with the best equipment, skills development and compensation. During debate, I supported an amendment by Congressman Mo Brooks that removed language from the bill encouraging the Secretary of Defense to waive enlistment requirements for illegal aliens. The NDAA is not the place for a debate on immigration, and its unfortunate that Democrats used the committee mark-up to advance a partisan issue on what should be bipartisan legislation supporting our troops. Protecting Civil Liberties and Strengthening National Security The House also passed legislation to reform the nations intelligence-gathering programs operated under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). H.R. 2048, the USA FREEDOM Act, would end bulk data collection and specifically prohibits large-scale, indiscriminate collection of data such as all records from an entire state, city or zip code. Congress should be vigilant in ensuring that the government doesn't infringe upon the constitutional rights of individual Americans, and I believe this legislation renews a focus on the civil liberties of our citizens while providing appropriate, narrow authorities to meet the countrys national security needs. Congressional Oversight of Iran Nuclear Agreement On Thursday the House passed legislation that would give Congress an opportunity to review any final international agreement on Iran's nuclear program before the president could waive or suspend congressionally-imposed sanctions. Our work on these issues is vital to ensure Iran does not gain a nuclear weapon with which to threaten the U.S., Israel and her other allies. With my colleagues in Congress, I will continue to do all in my power to provide oversight of these negotiations and ensure Irans compliance with the terms of any agreement. Whats Coming Up Next week the House will consider the America COMPETES Act, which would ensure that federal science funding is targeted at basic research and not presidential pet projects such as climate change or biofuels.

,114,Male,N00000267,43283,"Capuano, Michael (Rep.) [D-MA7]","Dear Friend, Thanks for signing up to receive this periodic correspondence. We hope you find the information useful. As always, let us know if you have any questions, comments or concerns. Office contact information is provided at the end of this e-mail. This is an unattended mailbox. Please do not reply directly to this e-mail. Instead, if you wish to e-mail us, please use the Write Your Rep account at May 15, 2015 Amtrak I am deeply saddened by the precious lives lost as a result of the Amtrak train derailment on the Northeast Corridor in Pennsylvania. My thoughts and prayers are with the families and friends who mourn. Many passengers suffered injuries and I wish them a speedy recovery. As the Ranking Member on the Transportation Committees Subcommittee on Railroads, Pipelines and Hazardous Materials, I traveled to the crash site Wednesday evening, along with Subcommittee Chair Rep. Jeff Denham. In addition to expressing our condolences and thanking first responders, we thought it was important to connect with investigators and understand more fully some of the challenges they are facing. Questions have already been raised about speed, track conditions and the effectiveness of existing safety measures. At this writing, we do not yet have a clear picture of the circumstances surrounding this tragedy. The investigation is underway although far from complete. The House was already in the midst of a debate about future funding for Amtrak and I expect those discussions to continue with some urgency. Trade Congress is expected to soon consider several trade agreements and I wanted to take some time this week to share my general thoughts on these upcoming votes. Trade agreements between the United States and other counties, or a group of countries, are negotiated by the President and Executive Branch officials. Like all treaties with foreign nations and the laws that implement them, these agreements are subject to Congressional approval. Historically, Congress has had the authority to agree, reject, or amend any proposed trade agreements submitted for ratification. If Congress amended the agreements, the President was then required to re-negotiate them in order to incorporate the changes. In the recent past, however, Presidents have requested Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), more commonly known as Fast Track. TPA significantly limits the voice of the legislative branch. A vote on granting the President TPA is expected soon in the House. TPA limits Congressional action on a trade agreement to a simple up or down vote. By approving TPA, Congress agrees to give up its right to amend the agreement, and we are being asked to do so before any agreement is even finalized. Trade Promotion Authority, or Fast Track, was first approved for deals negotiated between 1975 and 1980. It was extended from 1981 to 1988; and then again for trade agreements between 1989 and 1994. Fast Track was later re-adopted for deals negotiated between 2002 and 2011. Once again, Congress is expected to consider TPA or Fast Track. I think it is unwise for any Member of Congress to surrender our constitutional responsibilities without knowing exactly why this step is necessary and what specifically Congress is agreeing to. I voted against Fast Track Authorization in 2002 and I fully expect to vote no again this year. The reason TPA is being considered is because the Obama Administration is currently negotiating two trade deals. Details are very limited but here is a brief overview of them: Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)  * This is a trade agreement being negotiated between the United States and Australia, Brunei, Canada, Chile, Japan, Malaysia, Mexico, New Zealand, Peru, Singapore, and Vietnam. It is notable that China, Taiwan and South Korea are NOT part of this agreement. * The agreement is not yet finalized. * The President has declared the draft agreement CLASSIFIED. This means that Members of Congress, unaccompanied by staff, are allowed to read it under very specific conditions. It must be reviewed only in a secure location and we cannot make a copy. If we take notes, they must be surrendered before leaving the secure location. The draft agreement cannot be discussed with anyone for any reason, with the exception of other Members of Congress. In my early professional life, I was a tax lawyer and considered myself a tax law expert. Even then, I always tried to discuss tax issues with other professionals. I thought these discussions were important for many reasons. I wanted to hear the perspective of others and make sure I wasnt missing some aspect of an issue. This process always helped me to more fully understand the issue at hand. I am not a trade expert. In order to learn as much as I can about these issues, its important for me to discuss them with as many knowledgeable individuals as possible: business and labor leaders, human rights and environmental activists, economists and historians, as wide a variety of practitioners as possible. To render this sort of research illegal because all of the details are classified makes no sense to me. I am instead forced to discuss the deals in broad strokes and generalities and, remember, the deal isnt even finalized yet so no one can really speak with authority about what it will ultimately look like. Given these circumstances, it is highly unlikely I will get to a point where I feel my understanding of the complicated issues involved in TPP is adequate to cast a responsible vote on the treaty. When I am unsure about any issue, I walk a careful path and tend to listen much more closely to people I usually agree with, people who see the world as I do and share my principles. Therefore, since I am legally prohibited from discussing any details of the TPP now available to Members of Congress, AND because the agreement is not yet in final form, I will likely vote NO on TPP. If the Administration makes the full text of the deal public and it seems reasonable to me and to others whose judgment I respect, I may reconsider. At this writing, however, no such document is available. The second trade deal expected to be considered under TPA or Fast Track Authority is the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership (TTIP). This trade agreement is being negotiated between the United States and the 28-member European Union. All of the restrictions in place for TPP are in place for TTIP. That agreement is not finalized yet either. But unlike with TPP, there is no draft or outline of TTIP available to Members of Congress. Once a draft is ready for review, it will probably be classified and subject to the same restrictive rules as TPP. Our Constitution gives Congress serious foreign policy responsibilities, including the ratification of treaties. I have long been troubled by the unwillingness of administrations, both Republican and Democratic, to recognize this constitutional requirement and the wisdom of involving Congress in foreign policy. If you are interested in learning more about these trade issues, the Congressional Research Service (CRS) has prepared a thorough review: Clean Water Act On Tuesday the House considered H.R. 1732, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act. This legislation prevents the Administration from updating rules making it easier to assess which bodies of water are subject to the Clean Water Act. The Administration has been finalizing a rule and H.R. 1732 would require them to stop working on it, even though it is almost complete. This is nothing more than an effort to weaken the Clean Water Act. The Administration has already stated that H.R. 1732 will be vetoed. I voted NO. H.R. passed and the entire vote is recorded below: YEA NAY PRESENT NOT VOTING REPUBLICAN 237 0 0 7 DEMOCRAT 24 155 0 9 TOTAL 261 155 0 16 MASSACHUSETTS 0 8 0 1 Womens Health This week the House considered H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. This legislation prohibits abortions after 20 weeks. The legislation does not go far enough to protect the health of the mother. Many serious medical conditions can develop after 20 weeks, including heart conditions and some types of cancer. H.R. 36 does not contain an exemption if a womans doctor determines continuing the pregnancy will result in serious medical consequences for her. H.R. 36 also requires adult rape victims to either seek counseling or report the rape to authorities before obtaining an abortion. Documentation must be provided that this requirement was fulfilled, which would be placed in their medical file. Victims of incest and minors who are raped must comply with similar restrictions. H.R. 36 is nothing more than an attempt to undermine Roe v. Wade. The Administration has previously indicated that H.R. 36 would be vetoed. I voted NO. H.R. 36 passed and the entire vote is recorded below: YEA NAY PRESENT NOT VOTING REPUBLICAN 238 4 0 1 DEMOCRAT 4 180 0 4 TOTAL 242 184 0 5 MASSACHUSETTS 0 9 0 0 Patriot Act On Wednesday the House considered H.R. 2048, the USA Freedom Act. In part, this legislation reauthorizes Section 215 of the Patriot Act, which is set to expire in June. This is the section of the law that allows for the collection of any tangible thing. It has been the basis for bulk collection of phone records and other metadata. I have voted against the Patriot Act every time it has come before the House due to my concerns over individual liberties and privacy. H.R. 2048 represents an important step in the right direction, but only, in my opinion, if one accepts the premise that keeping the Patriot Act in place is good for America. I do applaud the authors of this legislation because it limits the collection of data under section 215. I hope it is a first step in re-asserting the right to privacy for all Americans. However, since I deeply fear that H.R. 2048 is offered as the LAST change to the Patriot Act, I could not support it. I will continue doing all I can to restore our right to privacy from both government and corporate intrusion. I voted NO. H.R. 2048 passed and the entire vote is recorded below: YEA NAY PRESENT NOT VOTING REPUBLICAN 196 47 0 1 DEMOCRAT 142 41 0 5 TOTAL 338 88 0 6 MASSACHUSETTS 5 4 0 0 Defense Authorization Today the House considered H.R. 1735, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016. H.R. 1735 authorizes funding for the Department of Defense and related programs. This funding comes in higher than allocated under sequestration, although domestic funding is still subject to that limit. Although this legislation does contain some provisions that I do support, such as those strengthening the militarys response to sexual assault and pay raises for military personnel, there was too much in H.R. 1735 that I do not support. I am concerned that defense spending continues to be exempt from sequestration. I continue to be concerned about the unequal treatment of defense and nondefense spending. If the sequestration caps are lifted for defense, then non defense spending should get the same consideration. I voted NO. H.R. 1735 passed and the entire vote is recorded below: YEA NAY PRESENT NOT VOTING REPUBLICAN 228 8 0 8 DEMOCRAT 41 143 0 4 TOTAL 269 151 0 12 MASSACHUSETTS 0 9 0 0 Iran Yesterday the House considered H.R. 1191, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. This legislation requires the President to present any agreement reached on Irans nuclear program to Congress within 5 days of its completion. It also prevents the Administration from lessening in any way the current sanctions on Iran for a specified period of time, giving Congress an opportunity to review the agreement. I voted YES.

,114,Male,N00027649,43542,"Huelskamp, Tim (Rep.) [R-KS1]","Congressman Tim Huelskamp ----------------------------------- Dear Friends, It has been a fantastic week legislatively for Kansas in many ways. On issues of Life, over-regulation, and promoting basic common sense, critical bills I cosponsored and promoted actually passed the House. Let me dive into some of the best news. * Pro-life** This week, we voted forH.R. 36 [link 1], the bipartisan Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act which will restrict abortion of 5-month-oldunborn babies capable of pain, which passed 242-184. This week marked two years since late-term abortionist Kermit Gosnell was convicted of three first-degree murders of newborns in his filthy abortion complex. One clinic worker estimatednearly 100 additional living babies werealso murdered after birth by Gosnell. Because of Gosnells House of Horrors, one of the first legislative actions I took this year was sponsoring the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. I also cosponsored similar legislation in the two previous congresses. I took to the House floor to speak to my colleagues and the country urging them to pass the bill. You can find the whole videohere [link 2]. I was proud to join my colleagues in passing this long-awaited Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. Kermit Gosnells horrific acts bring to light the gruesome violence against the most vulnerable among us every day. It is no less violent, gruesome, or painful to perform these barbaric abortions on unborn children than the murder of born children. All human life is precious, and we should protect it from conception. This bill significantly advances the cause of Life. * Ditching the EPA** After more than a year of efforts, we also passedH.R. 1732, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act of 2015 [link 3]. I cosponsored this legislation to stop the burdensome Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule from being implemented. Proposed by the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers, the WOTUS rule would dramatically expand the Clean Water Act, imposing costly and uncertain new permitting requirements for standard farming, ranching and other business activities. This bipartisan legislation demonstrates that lawmakers on both sides of the aisle are working to limit D.C.s growing over-regulation. The next step for reeling in the Presidents overreach will be for Senator Mitch McConnell and Senate Republicans to send this bill to the Presidents desk. Know that I will continue to work to protect Kansas farmers and ranchers, cities and counties, home builders and our other small businesses who have all vocalized strong opposition to the WOTUS rule. * *Delisting the Lesser Prairie Chicken** On Friday, the House also passed my cosponsored amendment to delist the Lesser Prairie Chicken (LPC). The amendment requires the United States Fish and Wildlife Service to delist the LPC, relieving Kansas farmers, ranchers, realtors and nearly every rural industry of this burdensome, job-killing over-regulation. It would return responsibility of LPC conservation to where it belongs: with local farmers, ranchers, and state, county, and local governments  not Washington bureaucrats who live thousands of miles away. Since 2011, I have been working hard to get the federal government off the backs of my fellow farmers, ranchers, small business owners and our rural economy. With passage of this amendment, we begin ending the massive regulatory threat to our rural way of life from the ill-conceived listing of the Lesser Prairie Chicken. It is high time that we place a greater value on the citizens of rural America than the Lesser Prairie Chicken. After years of work, its great to be able to help deliver this victory. * ACU Award** I am happy to announce that Tuesday I received the American Conservative Unions Award for Conservative Excellence for 2014.It is an honor to be recognized for voting for conservative principles.

I trust this finds you and your family well, as we work together to bring Hoosier common sense to Washington. For daily updates, please take a moment to ""Like"" my Facebook page by clicking here  or follow me on Twitter if you prefer  @ToddRokita. _____ In this week's Rokita Report * Arsenals of Democracy Flyover * Standing For Life * Preventing A Nuclear Iran * Indianapolis Angelman Syndrome Walk * Rokita Readings _____ Arsenals of Democracy Flyover Internationally, May 8th is known as Victory in Europe (VE) Day. On that day in 1945, Germany unconditionally surrendered to the Allied Powers, ending World War II (WW II) in Europe. This year was the seventieth anniversary of VE Day and a special flyover served as the finale of a commemoration ceremony held at the National WWII Memorial in Washington, DC. I was honored to be asked to participate as a co-pilot in the flyover. My friend and colleague Representative Sam Graves was the lead pilot. I can think of no better way to mark such a historic day, and the countless sacrifices that were made by our men and women in uniform, than roaring down the National Mall in the very aircraft that helped secure victory over Nazi Germany. I was honored to recognize the hundreds of WWII vets attending the ceremony, along with the thousands of others that could not make it to the event. It truly was a special occasion.  Arsenals of Democracy Flyover - Video from the Air  We flew aboard a TBM Avenger. From 1941 to the 1960's, nearly 10,000 Avengers were built. The Avenger was a torpedo bomber first used at the Battle of Midway, and flown in combat by former President George H.W. Bush. President Bush even signed the propeller on this plane with a message of support to all our WWII veterans. Our warbird led the last of the historically sequenced formations known as the Missing Man formation. The formation pays tribute to those lost in the war. Over 400,000 Americans lost their lives in World War II fighting for freedom. _____ Standing For Life As a pro-life Hoosier, I strongly believe in defending the most vulnerable of us. This week, the House passed H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. H.R. 36 is one of the strongest pro-life bills to ever pass the House. It is now pending before the Senate. Our Declaration of Independence states that we are all created equal and endowed by our Creator with certain unalienable rights  the first of these rights is life. H.R. 36 provides for this right, by protecting unborn children from abortion after five months. The overwhelming scientific consensus is that after twenty weeks an unborn baby can feel pain. Thanks to modern medical developments, children born at this point are also surviving in ever-increasing numbers. Many of these children are living normal, healthy lives and are living testaments to the life that unborn children can live. _____ Preventing A Nuclear Iran I strongly support Congressional oversight over the President's dangerous negotiations with Iran. On Thursday, I supported the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. This bill passed the House of Representatives with a strong bipartisan vote of 400 to 25. This bill gives Congress the right to review any international nuclear agreement with Iran. If necessary, thanks to this bill, Congress can reject the agreement. As I cast my vote, I remembered that just two months ago Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu spoke to a joint session of Congress regarding the threats posed by Iran and radical Islam. His warnings were all the more relevant because President Obama's disastrous policies in the Middle East have led to the rise of terrorist organizations like the Islamic State of Iraq and Syria (ISIS). The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act allows Congress to stand up to the President's disastrous policies and stop a bad deal with Iran. The bill also passed the Senate 98 - 1 and now heads to the President's desk. Both the House and Senate passed the bill with such overwhelming support that President Obama is expected to sign the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act into law, in the days ahead. _____ Indianapolis Angelman Syndrome Walk Tomorrow, May 16th, will be the Second Annual Angelman Syndrome (AS) Foundation Walk in Indianapolis. My wife, Kathy, is the organizer of the walk and has spent countless hours to ensure that the event is a success. She was recently profiled by the foundation. You can read her profile here  . When our oldest son, Teddy, was diagnosed with Angelman Syndrome, Kathy and I spent many hours researching AS. It is a rare nuero-genetic disorder that impacts about one in 15,000 births. Those with AS are known as Angels. There are hundreds of Angels like Teddy. Tomorrow, the Angelman community will be walking for all of these Angels. To learn more, please visit   . _____ Rokita Readings A clickable offering of books and articles that I've read recently and highly recommend, as we strive together to ""Keep the Republic."" In Indiana, the state legislature recently adjourned following a successful session. Governor Mike Pence had called for a focus on education and the results are in  it was a success. This week's Rokita Reading  is a piece that the Governor penned reflecting on the success of the 2015 legislative session. During this year's legislative session, the state boosted funding for education and expanded bonuses available to great teachers. As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Early Childhood, Elementary, and Secondary Education, I have led on legislation that gives states flexibility in their education programs. Hearing of the successes at home reinforces my belief that Washington bureaucrats don't know best and taking back powers from the federal government is a prudent course of action. As Secretary of State, I saw first-hand the success of Hoosier outside-the-box thinking that led to the largest infrastructure program in this states history  Major Moves  which funded critical projects to advance the Hoosier economy. As a Member of the House Transportation & Infrastructure Committee, I was excited to read Governor Pence's support for Major Moves 2020, Indiana's next plan to invest in expanding interstates and building on Major Moves. I look forward to helping lead on renewing our nation's federal infrastructure. _____ Thank you for your continued interest in Congress and for supporting my efforts to bring Hoosier common sense to Washington.

[R-TX11]","May 15, 2015 Conaway Chronicle: Stopping WOTUS, Challenging the President's Amnesty Plan, Protecting Pain-Capable Children, Time to Lift the Oil Export Ban __________________________________________ Thank you for reading The Conaway Chronicle, a review of my activities in Congress and in the 11th District. Stopping WOTUS This week, I spoke in support of H.R. 1732, the Regulatory Integrity Act of 2015. The bill, which would force the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers to stop moving forward with the proposed Waters of the United States rule, passed the House by a vote of 261-155. This rule, in its current form, is a massive overreach of EPAs authority and will impact nearly every farmer and rancher in America. It gives EPA the ability to regulate essentially any body of water they want, including farm ponds and even ditches that are dry for most of the year. The EPAs defense of this rule is that it provides clarity to producers regarding what is and is not regulated, but in reality, this rule will allow nearly every body of water in the United States to be controlled by federal regulators. To watch my remarks on the bill, please click here. Challenging the President's Amnesty Plan The President disregarded the Constitution when he implemented his illegal amnesty plan last year. As a result, the State of Texas stepped up to lead a lawsuit against the Administration to stop the Presidents executive action from becoming our nations new immigration policy. I joined 112 Members of the House and Senate to sign an amicus brief in that lawsuit. The President himself said over 20 times that he did not have the authority to act on immigration in the manner that he ultimately did, and in February, a U.S. District Court agreed and halted implementation of the Presidents executive action. Im confident that the courts will continue to find the Presidents actions illegal and unconstitutional as this suit moves forward. To read the amicus brief, please click here. Protecting Pain-Capable Children Wednesday, the House of Representatives voted to pass the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act by a vote of 242-184. I cosponsored this legislation because every child deserves to be protected and right now, thats not always the case. This legislation takes on the important task of defending the defenseless: pain-capable unborn children. There is nothing more important than respect for the sanctity of life and after 20 weeks, babies are able to feel pain and are increasingly able to live outside the womb. While I am saddened that this legislation will not protect all unborn children, it is a start. I would urge the Senate to take up this legislation quickly so that all children capable of feeling pain are protected under our law. Time to Lift the Oil Export Ban This morning, I once again spoke in favor of lifting the oil export ban. I submitted an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act this week that would repeal the oil export ban. While the amendment did not ultimately make it into the final bill, this is an important issue that is gathering nation-wide support. It has become an antiquated policy that is now only serving to harm Americans. For example, right now we allow Iran to export more oil than we do our own country. I will continue to fight to get this outdated ban lifted. To view my remarks on the House Floor, please click here.

I was glad to join the National Mail Handlers Union once again to talk about issues related to the United States Postal Service (USPS). Our communities need a strong and reliable 6-day delivery system in place and cant afford the sale of postal historic properties at a bargain rate. These are the two areas that I have focused on and will continue working on in the 114th Congress, said Congressman Jos E. Serrano.  Congressman Serrano at the National Mail Handlers Union Annual Conference (5/12/2015). Congressman Serrano Presented with Standing Tall for Zoos and Aquariums Award On Thursday, Congressman Serrano was presented with the Standing Tall for Zoos and Aquariums Award for his work in support of AZA- accredited zoos and aquariums all across the United States, and in particular the Wildlife Conservation Societys Bronx Zoo. I am truly honored to receive the Standing Tall for Zoos and Aquariums Award. Zoos and Aquariums not only serve as important recreational and educational sites, they play a key role in research and conservation efforts. We cant underestimate their value and need to continue investing in and supporting their work. In the Bronx, the Wildlife Conservation Societys Bronx Zoo has played an instrumental role in the cleaning and restoration of the Bronx River. Thanks to their work, Bronx residents enjoy today beautiful open green spaces and a cleaner environment in the midst of an urban setting, said Congressman Jos E. Serrano.  Congressman Serrano is presented with the 2015 Standing Tall for Zoos and Aquariums Award by Jennifer Keaton, Vice President for Congressional Affairs of the Association of Zoos & Aquariums. (5/13/2015) Congressman Serrano, Senator Schumer Send Letter to DHS to Extend TPS Registration Deadline for Individuals from Ebola-Affected Nations Today, Congressman Serrano and Senator Schumer led several of their colleagues in sending a letter to the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) asking them to extend the Temporary Protected Status deadline for eligible individuals from the ebola-affected nations of Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone. DHS announced the availability of Temporary Protected Status for individuals from these three nations as part of the response to the ebola outbreak there last year. With the registration deadline approaching next week, the Department of Homeland Security has not done enough to let individuals from ebola-stricken nations know about their eligibility for Temporary Protected Status or how to apply. That is why we are asking the Department to increase its outreach efforts and extend the deadline. The situation in the region remains fragile and they are not prepared to welcome a surge of residents back to their shores. We must ensure that everyone who is eligible for TPS knows about it and is able to apply, said Congressman Serrano. The letter was signed by both New York Senators, and by eight New York Members of the House of Representatives. Click here  for a full text of the letter. In the Bronx _____ Congressman Serrano Rallies in Support of Fast Food Minimum Wage Increase Last Friday, Congressman Serrano joined Governor Cuomo to rally in support of raising fast food workers minimum wage in New York. Last week, Governor Cuomo announced a proposal to impanel a wage board for fast food workers. Our states fast food workers need and deserve a raise,"" said Congressman Serrano. ""An industry that earns billions and compensates its top executives with million-dollar salaries every year should be required to pay its workers a fair hourly wage that allows them to meet their basic needs and to provide for their families. I fully support Governor Cuomos efforts to raise the fast food industry minimum wage in New York by setting up a Wage Board, and I applaud him for taking the lead and not giving up on this issue. The Governors action will help workers in the Bronx and across the state.  Congressman Serrano stands in support of raising fast food workers minimum wage to $15 an hour. (05/07/2015) Congressman Serrano Announces $130,000 in Funding for Arts Organizations in the Bronx Last week, Congressman Serrano announced $130,000 in federal funding from the National Endowment for the Arts (NEA) for six arts and cultural organizations in the Bronx that will be doing work in the 15th Congressional district. The six organizations are: the Bronx Council on the Arts, the Bronx Documentary Center, Dancing in the Street, Eugenio Maria de Hostos Community College Foundation, the Pregones Touring Puerto Rican Theatre Collection, and the Women's Housing and Economic Development Corporation. Arts and culture projects enrich our community and allow our artists and performers to develop their talents and showcase their creative work. They also serve as an important tourism magnet and job creator. This federal funding will help make possible the successful completion of six unique projects in a wide range of areas. Many of these programs will be free to the public, giving local residents the opportunity to enjoy engaging performances at no cost, said Congressman Serrano. Our community artists and cultural organizations have so much to offer, and play a critical role in preserving and developing our community's cultural identity.

[R-TX12]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email  News from Representative Kay Granger  ABOUT KAY  | 12TH DISTRICT  | CONSTITUENT SERVICES  | ISSUES  | MEDIA CENTER  | CONTACT KAY  Dear Friend, I wanted to let you know about a recent piece of legislation that has a big impact on the 12th District and our country. The National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2016 authorizes funding for Department of Defense personnel, equipment, operations and programs. The world is an increasingly dangerous place and the United States faces a number of diverse threats at home and abroad. This bill ensures that our military is ready to combat these threats and also provides for our service members and their families. Many residents of the 12th District serve in the military or build the weapons and aircraft used to defend our freedoms. The NDAA authorizes funding for six additional Joint Strike Fighters for a total of 63 planes. It also fully funds 19 V-22s and 29 H-1 Helicopters. In addition, the bill rescinds the Presidents ability to transfer detainees from the prison at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba without the approval of Congress. The detainees at Guantanamo Bay are enemy combatants who present a significant danger to the United States and our allies, and the President should not be able to unilaterally decide to transfer detainees to prisons in the U.S. or into the custody of other countries. Furthermore, the Act prohibits the transfer of detainees to combat zones, as was done during the Taliban 5 swap for Sergeant Bowe Bergdahl. As Vice-Chair of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee, I have a strong appreciation for the service and sacrifice of our men and women in uniform and their families. It is critical that Congress ensures that veterans and military retirees receive the benefits they have earned by virtue of their service. The bill includes a provision allowing new service members to contribute to a portable retirement savings plan similar to a 401(k). Currently, 83% of service members leave the armed forces with no retirement benefits because they have not completed 20 years of service. This provision provides all service members with retirement savings which can be transferred to their new employers retirement program.

It is a great duty and privilege to meet with my constituency and businesses to hear how legislative activity in Congress is affecting the Fifth District. I want to assure you that I place great value on the thoughts and views expressed to me and keep them in mind as I engage in the legislative process on your behalf. Please feel free to forward this e-newsletter to share pro-life and pro-family news in your community. It is my great honor to serve as your Member of Congress and it is my number one priority to represent you and the best interests of the Fifth Congressional District. Please do not hesitate to call, write, or e-mail me in the future with any of your concerns or questions. For federal-related issues, you may reach my Washington, D.C. office by phone at (202) 225-6405, or my District office at (800) 541-6446 for constituent services. I also encourage you to visit my website at HOUSE PASSES BILL TO PROTECT LIFE On May 13, 2015, the House of Representatives passed H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, with my support. This legislation would prohibit any person from performing an abortion if the age of the unborn child is 20 weeks or greater, with an exception for instances of rape, incest or when the life of the mother is at stake. Medical advances in recent decades have provided a greater understanding of the development of unborn children and their capacity to feel pain at various stages of growth. The legislative findings in H.R. 36 demonstrate that unborn children respond to painful stimuli after 20 weeks. Additionally, over 60 percent of people surveyed by Quinnipac support a ban on abortion after the first 20 weeks of pregnancy. A similar bill passed the House last Congress and the Congressional Budget Office conservatively estimated the bill, if enacted, would save 2,750 lives each year. Please be assured that I will continue to be vigilant in protecting the life of the unborn. HOUSE VOTES TO DEFEND CONSCIENCE PROTECTIONS On April 30, 2015, the House of Representatives passed a resolution to disapprove and prevent the implementation of the Reproductive Health Nondiscrimination Act (RHNDA) that was adopted by the Washington D.C. City Council late last year and was transmitted to Congress on March 6th for a Congressional review period of 30 legislative days. RHNDA could restrict the First Amendment freedoms of pro-life organizations in two ways: (1) force a religious or pro-life advocacy group to make personnel decisions inconsistent with their sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions about the sanctity of human life; (2) mandate that religious and pro-life advocacy organizations provide insurance coverage for surgical abortion. I am proud to have voted in support of this resolution to defend the conscience protections rights of organizations in the District of Columbia. GAO REPORTS ON FUNDING FOR ABORTION ADVOCATES The Government Accountability Office (GAO) recently revealed in a report that over the course of three years (fiscal year 2010-2012), six abortion advocacy groups received $481 million in federal funding, as well as about $1.2 billion in combined federal and state funds under federal health programs that require shared funding. The majority of the federal funding for the six abortion groups was disbursed through the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) and the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). Its unfortunate to see the use of taxpayer funds going to groups that openly advocate in support of abortion. That is why I am a cosponsor of H.R. 217, the Title X Abortion Provider Prohibition Act, which would ensure that Title X family planning grants are used for their intended purpose and are prohibited from being used by organizations that provide funds for abortions or to entities that perform abortions, such as Planned Parenthood. While not all of reported federal funding was distributed as Title X, a portion of the funds were through the family planning grants. The report states that during FY2010-2012, Planned Parenthood received $201 million in Title X family planning grants. Please be assured that I am committed to upholding the sanctity of life and forbidding the use of taxpayer funds to pay for abortion. PROTECT RELIGIOUS FREEDOM AT HOME AND ABROAD Our Nation was founded on the principle of religious liberty and freedom of expression. I believe that every individual regardless of religion should have the opportunity to practice his or her religion without fear of discrimination or retribution. Furthermore, the United States should stand as leader to advance and promote the ideas of religious liberty across the world. Therefore, this past month I cosponsored H.R. 1150, the Frank R. Wolf International Religious Freedom Act of 2015. This bill would seek to improve the ability of the United States to advance religious freedom globally through enhanced diplomacy, training, counterterrorism, and foreign assistance efforts, and through stronger and more flexible political responses to religious freedom violations. As your Member of Congress, I pledge to never support the persecution of any faith and work with my colleagues to ensure the protection of religious liberty.

Dear Friends, This week I returned to Washington, D.C. after leading a Congressional delegation overseas to examine security threats to the U.S. homeland. The focus of the trip was the surge in Westerners traveling to Syria and Iraq to fight  with terrorist groups like ISIS. The delegation assessed U.S. government and foreign partner efforts to shut down the flow of foreign fighters, many of whom return to their home countries in the West armed with combat training, extremist connections, and the desire to launch terror attacks. We met with government leaders and counterterrorism officials in Israel, Iraq, Turkey, Germany, Belgium, and France. The delegation identified gaps that make it easier for terrorists to travel across borders undetected, and we will be working to address those issues over the coming months in a bipartisan manner. In sum, extremists are riding a 'jihadi superhighway' through Europe, via Turkey, to get to and from the conflict zone. We need to shut this highway down. Our allies are waking up to the grave danger from foreign fighters. But more needs to be done. I spoke about the trip and what we found on Fox and Friends and The Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer, you can watch the clips below. McCaul on Fox and Friends  McCaul on the Situation Room with Wolf Blitzer  I also joined the Chris Salcedo Show on KSEV 700 AM radio to discuss the CODEL as well as stopping Obama executive amnesty and other topics. You can listen to the interview below.  This week the House passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)  for the upcoming fiscal year. Our nation needs a strong military in order to defeat terrorist organizations that seek to attack America at home and abroad. The NDAA helps create an agile, efficient, ready, and lethal military. It reforms the costly acquisition process and cuts wasteful, inefficient, or poorly budget programs. It also ensures our forces are ready to meet an unprecedented array of threats, and ensures our military technology is the best in the world. Within the NDAA, I offered an amendment, along with Congressman Carter (R-TX) and Congressman Rigell (R-VA) that would help keep our troops safe on our own military bases  . The amendment would allow base commanders to authorize concealed carry or personal firearms on military installations for personal protection or as a force multiplier. Texas has twice mourned deadly shootings at Ft. Hood including the terrorist attack in 2009 by Nidal Hassan. Enough is enough. Hundreds of thousands of Texans responsibly exercise their second amendment rights; it is time our troops are allowed to do the same on our military bases. Congress also passed, with overwhelming majorities, the Iran Nuclear Review Act which gives Congress oversight over the Iran nuclear agreement the President is currently negotiating. Instead of accepting our help with tougher sanctions the Homeland Security committee passed last year, the President has opted for an agreement that allows the world's leading state sponsor of terror to maintain a vast nuclear infrastructure. Even the Iranian President admits that the centrifuges will ""never stop spinning."" I spoke on the House Floor about this issue; you can watch the video below.  With Best Regards,  Michael T.

,114,Male,N00000684,43311,"Frelinghuysen, Rodney (Rep.) [R-NJ11]","Congressman Rodney Frelinghuysen, Representing the 11th District of New Jersey *e-News 5/15/15* - *The Week: National Security in Focus* - *Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act* - *Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act* - *National Defense Authorization Act* - *Playing Politics with Defense * - *Dutch Connection* - *Salute: The Thin Blue Line *  *The Week: National Security in Congress Focus* Under the Constitution, the first duty of each and every Member of Congress is to guarantee the security of the United States of America and its citizens. Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution of the United States, grants Congress the power to provide for the common defense; to raise and support an Army; to provide and maintain a Navy. In an era of growing and evolving threats to our safety and security, the House this week lived up to those responsibilities by passing several notable pieces of legislation: *Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act *which ensures that Congress will have a role in approving or disapproving of any final deal that emerges from ongoing negotiations between the Iranian regime, President Obama and various world powers. There are few national security priorities for our country more important than preventing Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon, and any agreement that seeks to do this must include Congress participation up front. The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act (a) prohibits the administration from lifting any sanctions over a two-month review period, (b) forces the White House to turn over every single page of the finalized deal's text, and (c) establishes a recurring 90-day review cycle that persists throughout the duration of the deal. I understand that work continues on a final agreement with Iran. But frankly, given many of the statements I have heard coming out of the Obama Administration AND Tehran, I am very skeptical that we will see a verifiable, transparent and enforceable agreement. Read the bill here [link 1]. *Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act*which aims to prevent Hezbollah and associated entities from using the international financial system to fund its global terrorist activities. ISIL has rightly claimed much of the spotlight recently, but Hezbollah, a whole-owned subsidiary of the government of the Islamic Republic of Iran, has historically killed more Americans than just about any other terrorist organization. That is why I have been a cosponsor of this important legislation. Read the bill here [link 2]. *National Defense Authorization Act*is one of the key bills that fund our national security operations, along with the Defense Appropriations bill I am currently drafting with my Subcommittee. I voted in favor of the NDAA this morning and was pleased that it passed the House. Because politics should never taint our support for our troops and their families, these bills have ALWAYS been the product of bi-partisan construction and receive strong bi-partisan support. It is, therefore, extremely regrettable that Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi disregarded this honorable tradition and prodded most democratic members of the House to vote no on the bill, simply because she did not like the manner in which the bill funded our overseas war on terror and the troops that support them. The **Washington Post** took her to task, writing, ""National Defense is a Clear Constitutional Responsibility of the Federal Government; Fully Funding it Should Take Priority."" Read the Post editorial, Playing Politics with Defense""here [link 3]. Read more of H.R. 1735, the National Defense Authorization Act for FY 2016 here [link 4]. Ten things to know about H.R. 1735: 1. It provides the resources for a strong national defense. The bill reflects both Congresss balanced budget planandthe presidents budget request, and it does so in a fiscally responsible way to ensure Americans get the most defense for the dollar. 2. It improves pay and benefits for our troops and their families, including allowing servicemembers to contribute to a portable retirement plan, cutting the backlog for military childcare, and implementing a joint formulary for medications between the VA and the Department of Defense. Amid calls forbetter careat the VA, this is an important step to ensure servicemembers receive the best and most consistent treatment as they leave military service. 3. It initiates landmark reformsto the Department ofDefensesbroken acquisition systemby streamlining the process, improving accountability, and eliminating outdated regulations. This will help ensure our military has the agility and technological edge to respond to the evolving security threats we face. 4. It calls for greater protection of our troops from sexual assault, including recommending expansion of sexual assault prevention training to ROTC and Junior ROTC programs, and enhancement of sexual assault prevention for male victims in the Armed Forces. 5. It reinforces the mission to defeat ISIL, including authorizing resources for security assistance to Iraqi forces, training and equipping Syrian rebels, enhancing Jordans military capabilities, and approving a pilot program to counter propaganda efforts. ISILs sophisticated use of social media was a frequent topic of discussion during Speaker Boehnersvisits with key partners in the Middle East, and he considers this kind of program vital to an overarching strategy to defeat this threat. 6. It imposes greater restrictions on transferring terrorists.In addition to continuing a bipartisan policy that keeps terrorists out of the United States, the bill rolls back the presidents authority to unilaterally transfer terrorists to other countries. This provision addresses the administrationsunlawful transferof five top Taliban leaders from Guantanamo Bay in exchange for Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl  an action that was taken without notifying Congress. 7. It strengthens oversight of terrorist transfers and communications, withholding 25 percent of funding for the Secretary of Defenses office until he fulfills Congresss request for documents related to last years unlawful transfer of five top Taliban leaders. The bill also requires the Department of Defense to report to Congress when former detainees attempt to re-engage and communicate with terrorists. 8. It strengthens the nations cyber defenses,including fully authorizing all U.S. Cyber Command and Military Service programs, and boosting incentives for companies to share information on threats and defensive measures with the Department of Defense. The House recently passed a series ofcybersecurity reforms. 9. It provides for lethal aid to Ukraine, so that Ukraine can better defend itself against Russian aggression. In March, a bipartisan group of House leaderswroteto President Obama urging him to approve lethal aid based on authority he has already been given, but he has yet to act. 10. It improves our missile defense capabilities, including authorizing resources for the planning and design of an East Coast missile defense site. As the committeenotes, this follows the presidents concessions to the Russians on missile defense, and a recent test showing that Iran continues to develop its capabilities. *Dutch Connection* I was honored to accept the *""*Ambassador C. Howard Wilkins Jr. Award for Outstanding Accomplishments in Politics, Government and Diplomacy** last night from the Netherlands-America Foundation. The formal partnership between our two nations dates back to the American Revolution, which, of course, the Netherlands supported. Our excellent bilateral relations are based on close historical and cultural ties as well as a common dedication to individual freedom and human rights. *Salute: The Thin Blue Line. *We mark National Police Week. The job of a police officer is not easy. Its very dangerous and often requires great personal sacrifice. So we say a heartfelt thank you to all of our police officers and their families for their dedicated service and daily commitment to our communities. We owe a special debt of gratitude to Patrick P.

After six full years of the Obama administrations weak commitment to our military readiness, now is the time reclaim a strong national defense as a top priority. That's why I voted for the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, which authorizes the resources necessary to protect our nation today and prepare for the threats of tomorrow. Additionally, this critical legislation will strengthen Georgias military installations, along with the communities they support. With more than 100,000 active-duty soldiers, reservists and guardsmen in Georgia  the fourth largest military population in the nation  I am proud to support our men and women in uniform by voting for this legislation. Protecting America From a Bad Deal A nuclear Iran is unacceptable, and thats why I voted for the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. Without this legislation, Congress would have no say in the Obama administrations agreement with Iran, leaving the administration to make whatever deal it wants. This bill, however, gives Congress the ability to conduct oversight on behalf of the American people, and to vote to approve or disapprove of the administrations deal before it takes effect. I will not support any plan that provides a path to a nuclear Iran. Protecting Innocent Life Years ago, my wife Julie and I worked with many concerned citizens to keep an abortion clinic out of Northwest Georgia. The mission to protect innocent life, born and unborn, has been at the core of my public service. Accordingly, I voted this week for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which bans abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, the point at which an unborn child can feel pain. My vote for this legislation is a vote to protect unborn lives, and the conscience of millions of people around the country who, like me, believe every unborn baby has the right to life. While we must continue fighting to save unborn babies in every stage of pregnancy, this bill represents a critical step forward.

,114,Male,N00009738,43294,"Culberson, John (Rep.) [R-TX7]","Dear Neighbor, In my new assignment as Chairman of the CJS Appropriations Subcommittee, I am working to ensure that federal agencies under my jurisdiction uphold the law as written by Congress  not as the President wishes they were written. If federal agencies want our hard-earned tax dollars, they will have to carry out the law as Congress intended, respect the Constitutional authority granted to the States, and live within their means. This week, my Subcommittee passed a fiscal year 2016 funding bill for the Departments of Commerce and Justice, NASA, NSF and other related agencies that ensures our hard-earned tax dollars are spent where they are needed most and cuts funding from programs where the federal government has no role. We cut 35 programs that are no longer necessary and we froze or reduced funding for more than a dozen bureaus, agencies and programs that can operate more efficiently. These savings allowed us to provide funding for 55 new immigration judges and support staff along the southern border. This will reduce the growing backlog of immigration cases and protect the rule of law by ensuring people who are here illegally are quickly adjudicated and sent back to their home countries. It also allowed us to increase investment in our U.S. Attorneys, Marshals, DEA and ATF agents and others who sit on the front lines of our immigration and criminal justice systems. The FBI earned the biggest increases in funding because they are often the first line of defense against terrorists, cyber criminals, and other criminals who wish us harm. Our enemies have discovered you can hard-wire Trojan horses into communications equipment, modems, routers, computer systems, and they are very difficult to detect. The FBI has become expert in spotting these threats, and the bill contains language that requires federal agencies to consult with the FBI before they invest in new computer systems. By using the power of the purse, we can prioritize spending where it matters most, reduce the size and scope of the federal government and stop President Obama and his damaging policies. Rest assured that I will continue to use my position on the Appropriations Committee and my seat in Congress to protect our rights and defend the rule of law.

This is just another God-given reminder of what we all are fighting for. In Congress, I wake up each morning with a focus on doing all I can to ensure our children and grandchildren have the bright future that they deserve. Listening to You In last weeks constituent poll, I asked for your input on two issues concerning small businesses and growing jobs. First, I wanted to know if you thought the federal government was overregulating small businesses. An overwhelming 73 percent of you said yes. And when I asked if you think the federal government should be spending more stimulus money to create jobs, 52 percent said no, while 29 percent said we should be spending more to create jobs out of Washington. Thanks to the more than 1,500 of you who participated in the survey. Protecting the Homeland and Preserving Thousands of Local Jobs After I testified before the House Armed Services Committee in support of the U.S. Navys request of funding for the production of twelve F/A-18 aircraft, the House passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) with the full funding I requested included. This funding will ensure that the Boeing production line in St. Louis will continue operations, thereby preserving thousands of jobs in the region. A Big First for Me, and a Win for Small Business My first piece of legislation, the Stronger Voice for Small Business Act, passed the House this week. The bipartisan bill, introduced with Rep. Gerry Connolly (D-VA), was attached as an amendment to NDAA legislation. It permits job creators to directly appeal to the Small Business Administration (SBA) when they believe they have been assigned an inappropriate SBA size standard, a mistake that could cost small businesses the ability to apply for financial assistance or to compete for federal contracts. Without my legislation, the only option available to a family business is to engage in a costly and time consuming litigation process. Standing Up to EPAs Overreach I am pleased my House colleagues joined me in passing a bill that would stop the EPA from expanding its federal regulatory power to cover most of our nations waters  including puddles, ditches, culverts, and farmland ponds. The EPAs unprecedented power grab over Americas waters would upend the balanced, federal-state partnership that has regulated U.S. waters for over 40 years. And it would put Southern Illinois agricultural heritage at risk. The Congressional Listening Tour Rolls On I recently conducted the fifth stop on my 12-county Congressional Listening Tour, this time in Chester, where I was glad to be joined by nearly 30 Randolph County residents. These sessions provide constituents an opportunity to share their thoughts and ask me questions on issues that are important to them.

,114,Male,N00030717,43599,"Bera, Ami (Rep.) [D-CA7]","As you may know, its National Women's Health Week. Ensuring women have access to high-quality, affordable health care is a deeply personal issue to me as a doctor, husband and father. I took an oath to give my patients the best options available to them, and to explain the risks and benefits of these choices. Women should be free to make the choices that are best for them, and respect their faith, family and personal situation. So I was especially alarmed by what some Washington politicians chose to focus onespecially during a week thats supposed to be focused on womens health. Instead of promoting access to care for all women, they pushed H.R. 36 - a radical assault on women's health care. This bill threatens a womans access to health care, even in cases of rape and incest. Please click here to see me speak out against this bill on the House floor: H.R. 36 also has no meaningful exceptions to protect the health of the mother. And it would force doctors to withhold possibly life-saving care or go to jail. This is a massive government overreach. I want my daughter to grow up in a country where she is in charge of her own health care decisions. A womans health care choices should be between her and her doctor  not Washington politicians. Especially during Womens Health Week, we should work to empower women and protect the doctor-patient relationship. Thats why I introduced a new bill today  the Womens Preventive Health Awareness Campaign Act: My bill calls for a national public awareness campaign on the importance of women's yearly doctor check-ups, or wellness visits. Encouraging women to see their doctors helps keep our wives, mothers, and daughters healthy. Wellness visits are a chance for women to see their doctors and prevent health issues from happening in the first place. It's also a chance to find and treat health problems early before they become more serious. Thats not only good medicine it can save lives and cut costs. But according to the Kaiser Family Foundation, in March of 2014 only 43 percent of Americans knew they could access no-cost preventive services. This includes yearly wellness visits for women. If you or someone you know is due for their wellness visit, please make sure to call your health provider. You can also click here to learn more about wellness visits from the National Women's Law Center: As always, I'm honored to work for you.

,114,Male,N00031681,43585,"McKinley, David (Rep.) [R-WV1]","David McKinley, Proudly Representing the 1st District of West Virginia *Are the Taliban terrorists?* On Thursday morning, America learned about another attack by the Taliban in Afghanistan that killed an American civilian. The President of Afghanistan immediately called the Taliban terrorists and enemies. Meanwhile, the White House refuses to designate the Taliban as a foreign terrorist organization. Earlier this year, I introduced a resolution calling on President Obama to speak straight with the American people. Just hours after the news came of the attack, the resolution was scheduled for a vote in the Judiciary Committee. It passed, and the pressure is on the President to name our enemies. Watch my speech from the House floor by clicking below: [image = floor.PNG] [link 1] *Securing Our Nation, Strengthening Our Military* Our American military should not be dependent on other countries for our safety. We must be able to build the weapons, gear, and vehicles for our servicemen and women here in America. And when we meet with folks across West Virginia, they tell us how important it is to protect and rebuild our manufacturing base. That is why I am proud the House passed a National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) this week that ensures our safety while helping American manufacturers who are the key to a strong middle class. A new provision in the bill requires at least one potential American supplier of rocket motors for tactical missiles be considered by the Department of Defense. In addition, two amendments I offered were included in the final legislation. One encourages research cooperation between the military and universities and the other establishes a program to help Reservists keep track of their service time. *Fighting EPA Overreach* Every week, it seems, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is attempting to control more and more of our lives. On Tuesday, the House voted to stop their latest destructive measure, an attempt to regulate puddles and ditches on farms and at construction sites. These are not the navigable waters EPA is allowed by law to regulate, instead this is an abuse of their power. For example, here is one of the waters they want to regulate just as if it were a lake or stream: [image = land.PNG] It defies common sense to punish farmers and homeowners for something Mother Nature controls. *Protecting the Most Vulnerable* I am proudly pro-life and have been my entire life. That is why I voted on Wednesday to protect unborn children capable of feeling pain. H.R. 36 strikes a common-sense balance to defend the most vulnerable members of our society. This bill is similar to West Virginias own law, which strikes a common-sense balance supported by sound science and a majority of the American people. *Congratulations Graduate* Anthony Brutto will graduate from WVU this Sunday along with 4,500 other students. Mr. Brutto deserves a special mention though because he will earn his degree 70 years after beginning his studies. A war (World War II), raising a family, and a few different careers sidetracked him, but it was always important to me to graduate, he says. Read Mr. Bruttos full story here [link 2].

Issues  Press  Schedule a Meeting  facebook  you tube  tweeter   May 15, 2015 Dear Cormack, In eastern Connecticut, our small towns often need creative and affordable financing solutions to provide the level of services their residents need -including water treatment infrastructure, police and fire department equipment and facilities, and other municipal assets. Investing in these projects is important for town residents and our regional economy, and in order to help local governments  afford these investments, I have worked to help secure low cost loans  and grants available through the U.S. Department of Agriculture's Rural Development program. Last year, as the Farm Bill was being debated in Congress, a rewrite of the ""rural"" definition threatened eastern Connecticut's access to the Rural Development program. Having seen the successful projects in towns around the Second District completed because of Rural Development financing, I led the charge to maintain the current definition-ensuring that towns like Bolton and Putnam would have access to low cost financing for critical community facilities. For Bolton, USDA provided $5.9 million in grants and loans used to construct sewers for the Bolton Lakes area that straddles Bolton and Vernon. In Putnam, the East Putnam Fire Station was built utilizing USDA funding, dramatically upgrading the outdated facility that hindered that department's public safety mission.  Congressman Courtney recently visited Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam, where a USDA Community Facilities Grant supported the purchase of critical monitoring equipment for emergency department patients. Additionally, I am supporting a state effort by Senator Cathy Osten to enable towns to apply for Rural Development funding, by removing restrictions in state law on the length of borrowing terms. Because federal Rural Development loans may be paid back over a 40-year period, instead of the usual shorter terms for Connecticut municipal construction bonds, they are more affordable on a year-to-year basis for small towns. Currently, state law caps the maturity of most of these bonds at 30 years, and Senator Osten's proposal would align the state requirements with the federal program - ensuring that more communities in our region can benefit from this critical investment. The Rural Development Community Facilities program provides financing and grants for a range of towns' needs, from purchasing police and fire vehicles to roads, bridges, and infrastructure. Recently, non-profit Day Kimball Hospital in Putnam received a $50,000 grant to purchase bedside physiologic monitoring equipment to improve patient safety and quality of care in the Emergency Department. Rural non-profits are eligible to apply for Community Facilities grants-learn more about eligibility and availability of grants by clicking here.

[R-MI1]","News from Representative Benishek  May 15, 2015 Dear Friend, This week in Washington, we have addressed a number of issues, from keeping our military well funded to protecting the lives of the unborn. It was also National Police Week, and it was great to meet with cops from Michigan who are working hard to keep us safe. Schools are starting to close for summer, and I had the opportunity to meet with students from Cheboygan and Suttons Bay this week as well. Next week, Congress will again be in session in order to deliver on the priorities of the American people. In the News Benishek: COOL Standards Threaten MI Jobs  Benishek Questions VA on Waste at Hearing  Benishek Opposes Nuclear Waste Storage Plan  Protecting Life  Having served as a doctor for over thirty years, I see the value of every human life. At 20 weeks of a pregnancy, a fetus can feel pain. I believe that these lives deserve protection, and that is why I co-sponsored and voted for H.R. 36, the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. This bill prohibits abortion after 20 weeks and successfully passed the House this week. Click here to watch me speak on the floor in support of this bill!  Holding the VA Accountable  At a Veterans Hearing this week, it was revealed that the VA has squandered billions of dollars through an inappropriate use of ""purchase cards"" intended for small items. Every year since I have been in Congress, VA officials have come before this Committee claiming that a lack of funds prohibits them from properly fulfilling their duty to care for vets. Every year, in response, we have increased the annual funding of the VA to ensure our veterans get the care they have earned. Now we learn that the billions of dollars we appropriated to fix the problems at the VA have instead been wasted by bureaucrats. The entrenched culture of lawlessness and corruption at this Department has to stop. Demanding Answers  This Administration never wants to give straight answers about the thought processes that go into their decision making. This fact was crystal clear at a Natural Resources Hearing this week when the Director of the Council on Environment Quality refused to say whether or not the President has been briefed on the appalling lack of environmental safeguards in place in China and India, our foreign economic competitors.

[D-CA12]","#WomenSucceed A Secure, Stable Retirement With this years celebrations of the 80th anniversary of Social Security and the 50th anniversary of Medicare and Medicaid, House Democrats are proud to announce the inclusion of retirement security as a pillar to our economic agenda, When Women Succeed, America Succeeds. Our economic agenda stands on four pillars of progress for Americas women and working families: fair pay, work and family balance, affordable, quality child care, and retirement security - the newest pillar of our economic agenda -which will ensure that after a lifetime of hard work, women can depend on a secure and enjoyable retirement. Together, we will set the foundation for a strong, vibrant, and resilient economy that will define the future of our country. Together, we will ensure that every generation of American women can enjoy the equal rights, equal treatment, and equal opportunities that they deserve. Joined @RepRubenGallego & Dem leaders to defend our countrys #DREAMers and reject the Republican assaults against them! Screen shot: Another Assault on Womens Health This week, House Republicans voted once again to restrict womens access to health care services by banning abortions after 20-weeks, with no exception for the health of the mothers. This vote is just the latest measure in an unprecedented series of assaults on womens health care this Congress, from restricting how women can spend private money in purchasing coverage to enabling D.C. employers to fire women for buying birth control. Republicans should stop wasting time with radical assaults on womens health, and start spending that energy to accomplish the things Americans really want and need, like providing good paying jobs, investing in infrastructure, and building an economy that works for everyone. Casework Spotlight: This week, a constituent contacted my office regarding her passport renewal application that she submitted in April so that she could travel to Europe in June. After six weeks, she had not received any response from the Passport Agency, which caused uncertainty for her upcoming travel plans. My staff contacted the Passport Agency and was able to confirm the passport application had been received and processed. We provided a tracking number to the constituent, and soon after, she confirmed that she had received her passport. For more information on how my office may be able to assist you with a federal agency, you may visit my website. Amtrak Northeast Regional Train 188 Our hearts go out to all of the passengers and crew caught in the horrific Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia on Tuesday and our thoughts and prayers remain with the family members of those who were killed and the victims still in critical condition. No words can console those who lost loved ones in this terrible derailment. But we can take steps to prevent future tragedy. We must have a thorough investigation and assessment of what went wrong, and I am pleased the NTSB and FRA have deployed teams. Now, it is time for Congress to work in a bipartisan way, as we have done in the past, to pass a fully funded Highway Trust Fund bill and ensure that Amtrak receives the resources it needs to transport its passengers safely throughout our nation.

,114,Male,N00009154,43313,"Goodlatte, Bob (Rep.) [R-VA6]"," Rep. Bob Goodlatte USA Freedom Act Protects Civil Liberties and National Security Almost two years ago, we learned that the National Security Agency (NSA) was collecting, in bulk, Americans' telephone records. Twenty-four hours a day, seven days a week, countless telephone metadata records are flowing into the NSA. Since then, the American people have made it clear that we need to rein in our nation's intelligence-gathering programs and end this assault on civil liberties. I wholeheartedly agree that this program threatens Americans' civil liberties and privacy. Despite President Obama's announced changes to this NSA program last year as well as the Second Circuit Court of Appeals' recent ruling that the government's bulk collection program exceeds what is authorized under the law, the bulk collection of records has not ceased and will not cease unless Congress acts to shut it down. Last year, the House passed legislation to do just that, but the Senate failed to act. Allowing the NSA's bulk collection program to continue operating in this way is not an option. This past week, the House acted once again to put an end to it. The USA Freedom Act, which passed overwhelmingly by a vote of 338 to 88, contains the most sweeping set of reforms to government surveillance practices in nearly 40 years. This strong, bipartisan bill ends bulk collection once and for all, enhances civil liberties protections, increases transparency for both American businesses and the government, and provides national security officials targeted tools to keep America safe. The terrorist threat is real and ongoing - we must always be aware of the threats we face. We cannot prevent terrorist attacks unless we can first identify and then intercept terrorists. At the same time, Congress must ensure that the laws we have enacted are always protecting our civil liberties. The USA Freedom Act takes both of these concerns into account. For example, it closes loopholes that make it difficult for the government to track suspected foreign terrorists, such as members of ISIS, as they enter and leave the United States. It also creates a panel of legal experts on matters of privacy and civil liberties to advise the court as it reviews the government's requests for information. Americans' liberty and America's security must co-exist. These fundamental concepts are not mutually exclusive. They are embedded in the very fabric that makes this nation great and that makes this nation an example for the world. The USA Freedom Act is essential in maintaining high levels of civil liberties protections and national security. Reforming our nation's intelligence-gathering programs is not a partisan issue, it's an American issue. Republicans and Democrats in the House and Senate as well as President Obama have come together in support of this historic legislation. The Senate should not delay reform again.

National Police Week 2015 This week, as we marked National Police Week, the House of Representatives also passed the Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu National Blue Alert Act of 2015. Last year, 127 men and women gave their lives while protecting Americans' public safety, including 3 officers in Virginia. I thank the law enforcement community for their service and sacrifice. It was an honor to speak in support of this bill on the House floor. Click here. The National Blue Alert Act reaffirms Congress' commitment to ensure the safety of the men and women in our nation's law enforcement communities and the citizens they serve and protect every day. This bill is named after New York City police officers Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu who, in December 2014, were murdered in cold blood by a malevolent killer who traveled from Baltimore to Brooklyn with the stated intention of shooting police officers. This bill - a tribute to their service and sacrifice - will hopefully spare other families from the pain of losing a loved one. House Acts to Protect Life As a father who recently became a grandfather, I know that the gift of life must be protected. This week, the House passed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy, post-fertilization -- the point at which scientific evidence shows the unborn can experience great suffering. This bipartisan bill is a victory for the most innocent and defenseless among us, our children. The majority of the American people support a ban at 20 weeks or earlier. Delivered or not, babies are babies, and they can feel pain at least by 20 weeks after conception. It is time to welcome young children who can feel pain into the human family. These babies deserve to live. Your Weekend Read: How can we force Congress to tackle real tax reform? By putting an expiration date on the current tax code.

King. Keep reading to learn more about what happened this week, or if youd like to receive the updates in this eNewsletter (and more) as they happen, simply like my Facebook page  . Be sure to check it regularly, as it will be updated often with news, pictures, and videos. My Plan to End Police Excessive Force  Improving Our Nations Decaying Infrastructure Remembering B.B. King and Kathryn Bowers Protecting a Womans Right to Choose  Welcoming Memphians to Capitol Hill Helping Children like 3-Year-Old Memphian Chloe Grauer  Grants for Memphis  My Plan to End Police Excessive Force America received a sobering wake-up call last year in Ferguson, followed by other tragic events in Staten Island, Cleveland, North Charleston, and more recently in Baltimore. The need for reform is as clear as it is urgent. Read about the plan Congressman Lacy Claywho represents Fergusonand I proposed this week to help end excessive force by police here  . The recent excessive force tragedies are not just instances of police brutality. The problem is deeper than that. We also have a flawed criminal justice system urgently in need of reform. Click here  to read my op-ed in Blue Nation Review on what we can do to help address the root problems. Improving Our Nations Decaying Infrastructure This New York Times editorial  gets it right. Our transportation infrastructure is decaying and I am very disappointed that just hours after this weeks deadly train derailment, which could have been prevented by an already-installed safety system that hadnt been turned on because of funding and other issues  , House Republicans voted to slash Amtraks budget. We should support our nations infrastructure, not starve it of needed funding that could help save livesnot only on Amtrak, but on our highways and bridges too. The Highway Trust Fund expires in just 4 legislative days, as Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx reminded us during this weeks visit to Memphis, but Republican leaders still havent proposed a plan to reauthorize it. Remembering B.B. King and Kathryn Bowers  I was saddened to learn this morning that B.B. King has passed away. He was from the Delta, but his career started at WDIA Radio in Memphis as the Beale Street Blues Boy disk jockey. B.B. was a legendary musician and gifted guitarist, but more than that he was simply a very, very, very nice man. He will be missed all over the world, especially in Memphis on Beale Street. You can watch the eulogy I gave commemorating his life on the House Floor this morning here  . We also lost Kathryn Bowers, who was a great warrior for justice and fairness and for Memphis, this week. She served more than a decade in the Tennessee General Assembly as a state representative and state senator and was always right on the issues. She was a tireless advocate for women, the poor and underserved, and those not represented by powerful interest groups. She was not afraid to speak truth to power. Kathryn was a friend who will be missed by many. Protecting a Womans Right to Choose  This week, the House passed an unconstitutional assault on a woman's right to choose under the guise of protecting fetuses from pain. But, as a Republican colleague of mine admitted, their bill isn't about fetal pain at all; it's about making an end run around the Supreme Court's Roe v. Wade ruling and ending abortion. Republicans couldnt name a single group in the medical community that supports their bill. Women should the right to make decisions with advice from those she trusts. Medical experts, not politics, should help women with these difficult decisions. Watch me speak out against this attack on womens rights here  . Welcoming Memphians to Capitol Hill   This week I was pleased to welcome several groups of Memphians to Capitol Hill. Two groups of students met with me on the steps of the United States Capitol: Whitney Achievement Elementary Schools 5th grade class arrived with questions about working in Congress and the daily schedule of a Congressman, and St. Francis of Assisi Schools 8th grade class spoke with me about issues including college affordability and improving collegiality in Washington.  I also met with film and television actor David Winston. David was in Washington along with representatives from the Delta Leadership Institute to discuss their efforts in the economic development of the Delta region. I was pleased to have the opportunity to learn more about the work of the Delta Leadership Institute, and am thankful for their efforts to improve our home of Memphis, and the state of Tennessee.  Finally, I also enjoyed meeting Anita Curry-Jackson, Leslie Jackson, Pamela Mitchell and Memphis Vietnam veterans Adrian Kilgore and Roy Jackson in the Capitol's Rayburn Room, where I thanked them for their service and talked about their trip to Washington as well as shared memories of the late B.B. King. Mr. Kilgore was my postman years back, and he recalled B.B. King's first show on WDIA radio as well as sang the Pepticon ditty that B.B. was known for in his first WDIA stint. As always, it was my pleasure to welcome Memphians to Washington. Helping Children like 3-Year-Old Memphian Chloe Grauer Three-year-old Chloe Grauer suffered from debilitating seizures that could have been alleviated by cannabidiol (CBD), but the treatment was denied to her because of out-of-touch state and federal drug laws. CBD does not contain enough THC to produce a high, and it has been shown to work for similar medical conditions. I am pleased that a healthcare issue like this is becoming more bipartisan by the day, and I commend Senators Gardner, Wyden, Isakson, Merkley, Hatch, and Bennet for introducing a bipartisan bill in the Senate to help children like Chloe, who passed away late last year, have access to this vital treatment. Read more about their bill here  . Grants for Memphis The Memphis Health Center provides important health services and high-quality, affordable care to citizens throughout the Ninth District. I was pleased to announce more than $3.7 million in federal funding for the Health Center today which will help it reduce health inequalities and disparities in Shelby County.

[D-HI]"," OHANA NEWSLETTER: Senator Hirono Welcomes Deputy Secretary Harden to Hawaii & Prime Minister Abe to the United States May 2015  Aloha Hirono Ohana, Welcome to the first edition of the Ohana Newsletter, a monthly update on issues facing Hawaii and our nation, and the latest developments in the U.S. Senate. There's a lot to do to make sure that the unique voices and concerns of our island communities are heard almost 5,000 miles away. From connecting Hawaii businesses with federal officials by hosting the annual ""Hawaii on the Hill"" event, to fighting for the U.S.'s only domestic coffee industry by pushing for funding and resources to fight the coffee berry borer, Hawaii always comes first for me and I'm proud to be your voice in the United States Senate. Last month, Deputy Secretary of Agriculture Krysta Harden, the second-in-command at the U.S. Department of Agriculture, traveled to Hawaii. I was proud to have the opportunity to show Deputy Secretary Harden firsthand how the Department of Agriculture is an important partner in serving Hawaii's unique agricultural needs- and also how we can continue to build on that relationship to promote a more sustainable future in Hawaii. Over the course of three busy days, the Deputy Secretary and I visited coffee farms in Kona facing the impact of the coffee berry borer. We met with community members to learn more about the impacts of albizia and how USDA is helping with community rebuilding after Hurricane Iselle. We also visited a training program for Hawaii's next generation of farmers on Oahu, and programs that encourage Hawaii's growing agricultural economy. _____  John and Eric Tanouye of Green Point Nurseries have built a thriving small business in Hilo _____  Deputy Secretary Harden and I visited farmers at the Kunia Village AgriBusiness Complex on Oahu _____ While meeting with the next generation of Hawaii farmers and visiting programs that foster and encourage Hawaii's growing agricultural economy, I was able to show Deputy Secretary Harden how the Department of Agriculture can be a partner in serving Hawaii's unique agricultural needs. Stay tuned for more updates on how the Department of Agriculture will put lessons learned from Deputy Secretary Harden's trip into action. I am privileged to serve the people of Hawaii in the United States Senate and it is important for your voices to be heard in Congress. Please contact my Hawaii office at 808-522-8970 or leave a comment on my website with any concerns or ideas you may have. Sincerely,  Mazie K. Hirono U.S. Senator _____ Washington, D.C. Update Senator Hirono Introduces College Affordability Plan Senator Mazie K. Hirono rolled out her college affordability package to permanently protect and expand the Pell Grant program. For over 40 years, the Pell Grant program has been foundational to putting higher education within reach for students from low-income backgrounds across the country. Today, over 8 million students use Pell Grants to help pay for college, including over 23,000 in Hawaii. The Senator's package of four bills would protect allow students to use the program for summer classes, increase grant amounts to keep up with rising college tuition, and allow DREAMers who were brought to the United States at a young age and attend high school in the United States to utilize the Pell Grant program.

That point isn't lost on U.S. Sen. Mazie Hirono. Serving as a member of the Senate Select Intelligence Committee - in her freshman term, it should be noted - she has paid particular attention to the Freedom of Information Act, the venerable 50-year-old law that requires the public disclosure of records held by the federal government..We commend Sen. Hirono's understanding of that principle and encourage her and her colleagues to remove this overreaching, unnecessary FOIA exemption before the bill goes before the full Senate.""

I would like that thank all of the Arkansans who were a part of it by visiting my office during their visits to our nations capital, including Major Josh Baker, the Arkansas Paper Recycling Coalition, Jennifer Necessary of Rogers, the Arkansas Realtors, the Rollene family of Elm Springs, Arkansas Tech students and faculty, the Cole family of Roland, the Arkansas Chapter of the American Heart Association, Gene O'Nale of the Arkansas National Guard, Arkansas State Representative Matt Pitsch, Carlette Metcalf of Springdale, the Arkansas Pharmacists Association, Arkansas Veterans Affairs Assistant Secretary for Benefits Allison Hickey, Carolyn Philpot of Fort Smith, Jeff Frisby of the Arkansas National Guard, the Arkansas Oil Marketers Association, Paul Coates of Thornton, the Arkansas Rheumatologists, and Anthony Sanders of the Arkansas National Guard. Safe travels back to Arkansas! [image = On Tuesday afternoon, *Senator Boozman, Senator Cotton, and I announced* [link 1] that the Fort Smith Regional Airport will receive nearly $592,000 in grant money from the Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) to be used for firefighting equipment. In an area with as much economic promise as Fort Smith, a thriving regional airport is key, and I am proud to join with my colleagues to celebrate this grant. It is yet another building block to continued prosperity for Fort Smith. Tuesday evening, the House passed two bills under suspension  the Dont Tax Our Fallen Public Safety Heroes Act (*H.R. 606* [link 2];* **Roll Call #216* [link 3]) and the Defending Public Safety Employees Retirement Act (*H.R. 2146* [link 4];* **Roll Call #220* [link 5])  and the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act of 2015 (*H.R. 1732* [link 6]) by a vote of 261-155 (*Roll Call #219* [link 7]). H.R. 1732 requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to withdraw its Waters of the U.S. proposal, which greatly expands the federal governments power over waterways without stakeholder input. [image = Heart Assoc (1).JPG] On Wednesday, the House passed the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 (*H.R. 2048* [link 8]) by a vote of 338-88 (*Roll Call #224* [link 9]). The bill includes numerous reforms to the nations intelligence-gathering programs operated under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) by building on legislation (H.R. 3361) passed in the 113th Congress to reform surveillance authorities and strengthen privacy and civil liberties protections. Ultimately, H.R. 2048 ensures that the U.S. Intelligence community has the necessary tools it needs to protect our homeland from an array of terrorist threats, while also increasing transparency and civil liberty protections for Americans. [image = Tech (5).JPG] Additionally, the House passed the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (*H.R. 36* [link 10]) by a vote of 242-184 (*Roll Call #223* [link 11]). H.R. 36 generally prohibits the abortion of unborn children at 20 weeks after fertilization or later with certain exceptions. Unborn lives matter, and making sure our unborn that can feel pain are protected from abortion is long overdue. As a cosponsor, I applaud the passage of H.R. 36, which not only prohibits abortion after the 20th week of pregnancy  the point at which fetuses feel pain  but also provides compassionate care for mothers coping with traumatic, stressful, and emotional decisions about abortion. I will continue to support policies that protect life and human dignity. On Thursday, the House passed two bills under suspension  the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 (*H.R. 1191* [link 12];* **Roll Call #226* [link 13]) and the Hezbollah International Financing Prevention Act of 2015 (*H.R. 2297* [link 14];* **Roll Call #227* [link 15]). [image = ALS MAY15.JPG] We wrapped up the week by passing the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for (FY) Fiscal Year 2016 (*H.R. 1735* [link 16]) today by a vote of 269-151 (*Roll Call #239* [link 17]). The NDAA authorizes and prioritizes funding for the Department of Defense (DoD) and other select national security programs within the Department of Energy for FY 2016. Specifically, the bill authorizes $515 billion in spending for national defense and an additional $89.2 billion for the Overseas Contingency Operations fund (OCO), for a total of $604.2 billion, which is equal to the Presidents overall budget request. Regardless of the gridlock in Washington and our countless disagreements, there is one commitment that both sides of the aisle must come together to uphold  our commitment to our men and women in uniform. I commend Chairman Thornberry for his leadership and on the passage of the fifty-fourth consecutive National Defense Authorization Act and join my colleagues in sending the Senate a bill that provides for our military in a way that is both fiscally responsible and mindful of the growing threats across the globe. From ISIL to Boko Haram, our enemies are becoming bolder and more numerous, but defending our nation and defeating terrorist threats is one place where politics should not  and cannot  interfere.

[R-CO5]","U.S. Congressman Doug Lamborn, Colorado's 5th Congressional District *Climatologist Denies Connection Between Emissions and Extreme Weather* 5/15/15 This week in the House Natural Resources Committee, Congressman Doug Lamborn engaged in a fascinating dialogue withMr. John Christy Professor of Atmospheric Science and State Climatologist National Space Science and Technology Center, University of Alabama. During their exchange, Professor Christy categorized the impact that a single project (such as a coal-fired power plant) would have on the climate of the planet would be, ""like spitting in the ocean."" The professor also pointed out that real world atmospheric climate data collected by balloons and satellites over the last three decades has not matched up with the predictions laid out by the last three decades of climate modelling. *""We must always strive to be good stewards of our environment. However, we must not cripple our economy and potential for growth and development with hugely expensive costs based on assertions that are being disputed and questioned within the scientific community. I commend Professor Christy for his courage in speaking up on this very important issue.""* - Congressman Doug Lamborn (CO-05) *Please click HERE [link 1] to watch the dialogue* [image = EMR.jpg] *Text of Professor Christy's Testimony* I am John R. Christy, Distinguished Professor of Atmospheric Science, Alabamas State Climatologist and Director of the Earth System Science Center at The University of Alabama in Huntsville. I have served as a Lead Author, Contributing Author and Reviewer of United Nations IPCC assessments, have been awarded NASAs Medal for Exceptional Scientific Achievement, and in 2002 was elected a Fellow of the American Meteorological Society. It is a privilege for me to offer my analysis of the impact that proposed regulations might have on the climate system. My research area might be best described as building datasets from scratch to advance our understanding of what the climate is doing and why. I have used traditional surface observations as well as measurements from balloons and satellites to document the climate story. Many of our UAH datasets are used to test hypotheses of climate variability and change. Impact of Single (or many) Federal Projects on Climate The basic question under consideration here is to understand whether there is a causal relationship between the carbon emissions generated by a single proposed federal project and possible climate change related to those emissions. It is obvious that the emissions generated by a single project would be vanishingly small in comparison to the current emissions of the global economy or even of the United States as a whole. Because of the minuscule nature of the relative size of its emissions, the impact of a single project on the global climate system would be imperceptible. To demonstrate any impact at all on the climate system, we must scale up the size of the emission changes to a much larger value than that of a single project. By doing so, our tools would then be able to provide some results. Let us assume, for example, that the total emissions from the United States are reduced to zero, today, 13 May 2015. In other words as of today and going forward, there would be no industry, no cars, no utilities, no people  i.e. the United States would cease to exist as of this day. With this we shall attempt to answer the question posed by the NEPA statement which is, essentially, what is the climate change through GHG emissions. [Note: There seems to be some confusion here. The NEPA statement appears to call for the calculation of the amount of climate change brought about by the emission levels proposed for each project. However, the CEQ guidance states, the potential effects of a proposed action on climate change as indicated by its GHG emissions. The CEQ guidance, in effect, claims that any GHG emissions in some sense relate to all of the alleged consequences of extra GHGs. Thus, the guidance apparently seeks to claim emissions are a direct proxy for negative impacts of climate change (which as shown below has not been established) while skipping any calculation of that effect from the individual projects. Then, inconceivably, the guidance does not even consider the inarguably positive consequences of increases in GHG emissions which are quantifiable as well: (1) the enhancement of the length and quality of human life through affordable energy, and (2) the invigoration of the biosphere (specifically plant material used for human food).] Using the U.N. IPCC impact tool known as Model for the Assessment of Greenhouse-gas Induced Climate Change or MAGICC, graduate student Rob Junod and I reduced the projected growth in total global emissions by U.S. emission contribution starting on this date and continuing on. We also used the value of the equilibrium climate sensitivity as determined from empirical techniques of 1.8 C. After 50 years, the impact as determined by these model calculations would be only 0.05 to 0.08 C  an amount less than that which the global temperature fluctuates from month to month. [These calculations used emission scenarios A1B-AIM and AIF-MI with U.S. emissions comprising 14 percent to 17 percent of the 2015 global emissions. There is evidence that the climate sensitivity is less than 1.8 C, which would further lower these projections.] Because changes in the emissions of our entire country would have such a tiny calculated impact on global climate, it is obvious that single projects, or even entire sectors of the economy would produce imperceptible impacts. In other words, there would be no evidence in the future to demonstrate that a particular climate impact was induced by the proposed regulations. Thus, the regulations will have no meaningful or useful consequence on the physical climate system  even if one believes climate models are useful tools for prediction. How well do we understand the climate? It is important to understand that projections of the future climate and the specific link that increasing CO2 might have on the climate are properly defined as scientific hypotheses or claims, not proof of such links. The projections being utilized for this and other policies are based on the output of climate model simulations. These models are complex computer programs which attempt to describe through mathematical equations as many factors that affect the climate as is possible and thus estimate how the climate might change in the future. The equations for many of the important processes are not exact, but represent the best approximations modelers can devise at this point. A fundamental aspect of the scientific method is that if we say we understand a system (such as the climate system) then we should be able to predict its behavior. If we are unable to make accurate predictions, then at least some of the factors in the system are not well defined or perhaps even missing. [Note, however, that merely replicating the behavior of the system (i.e. reproducing what the climate does) does not guarantee that the fundamental physics are well-known. In other words, it is possible to obtain the right answer for the wrong reasons, i.e. getting the what of climate right but missing the why.] Do we understand how greenhouse gases affect the climate, i.e. the link between emissions and climate effects? A very basic metric for climate studies is the temperature of the bulk atmospheric layer known as the troposphere, roughly from the surface to 50,000 ft altitude. This is the layer that, according to models, should warm significantly as CO2 increases. And, this CO2-caused warming should be easily detectible by now, according to models. This provides a good test of how well we understand the climate system because since 1979 we have had two independent means of monitoring this layer  satellites from above and balloons with thermometers released from the surface. I was able to access 102 CMIP-5 rcp4.5 (representative concentration pathways) climate model simulations of the atmospheric temperatures for the tropospheric layer and generate bulk temperatures from the models for an apples-to-apples comparison with the observations from satellites and balloons. These models were developed in institutions throughout the world and used in the IPCC AR5 Scientific Assessment (2013). The information in this figure provides clear evidence that the models have a strong tendency to over-warm the atmosphere relative to actual observations. On average the models warm the global atmosphere at a rate three times that of the real world. Using the scientific method we would conclude that the models do not accurately represent at least some of the important processes that impact the climate because they were unable to predict what has occurred. In other words, these models failed at the simple test of telling us what has already happened, and thus would not be in a position to give us a confident answer to what may happen in the future and why. As such, they would be of highly questionable value in determining policy that should depend on a very confident understanding of how the climate system works. There is a related climate metric that also utilizes atmospheric temperature which in models has an even larger response than that of the global average shown above. This metric, then, provides a stronger test for understanding how well models perform regarding greenhouse gases specifically. In the models, the tropical atmosphere warms dramatically in response to the added greenhouse gases  more so than that of the global average atmospheric temperature. In the tropical comparison here, the disparity between models and observations is even greater, with models on average warming this atmospheric region by a factor of four times greater than in reality. Such a result re-enforces the implication above that the models have much improvement to undergo before we may have confidence they will provide information about what the climate may do in the future or even why the climate varies as it does. For the issue at hand, estimates of how the global temperature might be affected by emission reductions from the halting of projects would be over done and not reliable. As such greenhouse gas emissions cannot be used as a proxy for alleged climate change because our capability to demonstrate how greenhouse gases influence the already-observed climate is so poor. Alleged impacts of human-induced climate changes outlined in the CEQ Guidance As stated in the bracketed paragraph earlier, the CEQ guidance attempts to equate any GHG emissions with all alleged impacts of these emissions, which as mentioned earlier is apparently not consistent with NEPA. In other words, CO2 is assumed to be a direct proxy for alleged climate change due to human activities. However, these claimed impacts are not even consistently backed up by observational evidence: from the CEQ, observed to date and projected to occur in the future include more frequent and intense heat waves, more severe wildfires, degraded air quality, more heavy downpours and flooding, increased drought, greater sea-level rise, more intense storms, harm to water resources, harm to agriculture, and harm to wildlife and ecosystems. (Section II.B pp 6- 8.) A simple examination of several of these alleged observed to date changes in the climate indicates the CEQ has evidently disregarded the actual observational record. I shall offer several examples which indicate these claims are misrepresentative. In terms of heat waves, below is the number of 100 F days observed in the U.S. from a controlled set of weather stations. It is not only clear that hot days have not increased, but it is interesting that in the most recent years there has been a relative dearth of them. Forest and wild fires are documented for the US. The evidence below indicates there has not been any change in frequency of wildfires. The two figures above demonstrate that fire events have not increased in frequency in the United States during the past several decades. The claims that droughts and floods are increasing may be examined by the observational record as well. The two figures above demonstrate that moisture conditions have not shown a tendency to have decreased (more drought) or increased (more large-scale wetness). Such information is rarely consulted when it is more convenient simply to make unsubstantiated claims that moisture extremes, i.e. droughts and floods (which have always occurred), are somehow becoming even more extreme. Over shorter periods and in certain locations, there is evidence that the heaviest precipitation events are tending to be greater. This is not a universal phenomenon and it has not been established that such changes may be due to changes in greenhouse gas concentrations as demonstrated earlier because the model projections are unable to reproduce the simplest of metrics. It is a simple matter to find documentation of the ever-rising production of grains. One wonders about the CEQ allegation that there has been harm to agriculture from human-induced climate change because when viewing the total growth in production, which appears to be accelerating, one would assume no harm has been done during a period of rising greenhouse gases. With the evidence in these examples above, it is obviously difficult to establish the claims about worsening conditions due to human-caused climate change, or more generally that any change could be directly linked to increasing CO2. This point also relates to the issue of climate model capability noted earlier. It is clear that climate models fall short on some very basic issues of climate variability, being unable to reproduce what has happened regarding global temperature, and therefore not knowing why any of it happened. It is therefore premature to claim that one knows the causes for changes in various exotic measures of weather, such as rainfall intensity over short periods, which are not even explicitly generated in climate model output. In summary, the information above indicates that preventing individual projects from going forward or even shutting down entire sectors of the energy economy will have no impact on the global climate system. Further, the information above indicates that the scientific understanding (i.e. climate models) of how increasing greenhouse gases are affecting the climate is rather poor, with no quantified and established link between emissions growth and specific changes in climate or disruptive weather.  ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- [link 1] Contact Information: Website: WASHINGTON OFFICE 2402 Rayburn HOB Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-4422 Fax: (202) 226-2638 DISTRICT OFFICE 1271 Kelly Johnson Blvd. Suite 110 Colorado Springs, CO 80920 Phone: (719) 520-0055 Fax: (719) 520-0840 DISTRICT OFFICE 415 Main Street Buena Vista, CO 81211 Phone: (719) 520-0055 Fax: (719) 520-0840 Privacy Policy: Unsubscribe: ",2015-01-06,5,Rep.,Representative,true,CO,doug.lamborn@houseenews.net,05/15/2015,Republican,2698,,http://lamborn.house.gov,Representative for Colorado's 5th congressional district,Doug,RepDLamborn,,Lamborn,L000564,202-225-4422,1954-05-24,https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/doug_lamborn/412191,CongressmanLamborn,,representative,1022846,Representative,2017-01-03,Rep.

Developing a new treatment for a disease currently costs over $1 billion, takes 10 to 15 years, and requires researchers to overcome mountains of red tape to obtain approval from the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to market a drug. In the last year, the Committee has held over a dozen hearings and forums  to gather input from federal agencies like the FDA and the National Institutes of Health (NIH), scientists and doctors from leading medical research institutions like Johns Hopkins University and the Mayo Clinic, as well as patient-advocates who live with these diseases and participate in the clinical trials to develop new cures and treatments. Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee Chairman Tim Murphy held a local roundtable  last fall with disease advocates from more than 15 different organizations, including Pittsburgh chapters of the Multiple Sclerosis (MS) Society, the Juvenile Diabetes Foundation, the Alzheimers Association, and the American Cancer Society, to gain insight into the patients perspective of the drug approval process. A representative from Canonsburg-based generic drug developer Mylan Institutional and Dr. Pamela McInnes, the Deputy Director of the NIHs National Center for Advancing Translational Sciences (NCATS), also attended the discussion. Chairman Murphy reported the findings of the meeting back to the Committee as it was drafting the 21st Century Cures legislation. Last Friday, Chairman Murphy continued this dialogue with Mary Crist and Maureen Durkin, Mt. Lebanon representatives of the Leukemia and Lymphoma Society. Ms. Crist, one of the participants in the Congressmans October forum, and Ms. Durkin discussed with Rep. Murphy new developments  in the 21st Century Cures Initiative, as well as Rep. Murphys cosponsorship of the Patients Access to Treatment Act (H.R. 1600). H.R. 1600 limits drug tier systems in health insurance plans that cause patients who need the most expensive medications to pay a percentage (or co-insurance) of the total cost of the drug, rather than a standard co-pay, which is the case for most inexpensive and generic drugs. In many cases, this co-insurance quickly adds up to hundreds or thousands of dollars per prescription, which these patients must pay out-of-pocket. The bill, which Congressman Murphy also cosponsored in the last session of Congress, was reintroduced on March 27th, and it is currently awaiting review by the Health Subcommittee.

Murphy A group of sophomores, juniors, and seniors studying computer science at Robert Morris University traveled to Washington D.C. this week for a two week-long seminar entitled National Security 2015. The underclassmen, who stayed at the Washington Center for Internships and Academic Seminars in D.C., were interested in pursuing cyber security careers. During their time in the nations capital, the college students were able to attend and participate in classroom lectures and hear from the best cybersecurity professionals in the country. The seminar provided the group with insight into emerging cyber threats to national security and Americas largest industries  and how to combat them. On the U.S. Capitol steps, Congressman Murphy spoke with the college students about how vital their work in cybersecurity is for future generations, stressing that thwarting cyberattacks is crucial to protecting national security and the American and global economies. The visit capped off a week that began with another higher education event. Rep. Murphy paid a visit to Wheeling Jesuit University over the weekend to deliver a commencement speech for the class of 2015.

[R-PA]"," On The Ground My heart goes out to the families of those who were killed and those injured in the train derailment in Philadelphia Tuesday night. It was a terrifying tragedy but thankfully the city's dedicated first responders went quickly to the scene and were able to free some passengers from the wreckage and provide medical help. I appreciate their ongoing efforts. In addition to reaching out to Amtrak and the National Transportation Safety Board, my office has been and continues to be in contact with Mayor Nutter and Governor Tom Wolf. I visited the site of the derailment on Wednesday with Senator Casey to receive updates from local, state, and federal officials. Considering the importance of Amtrak's Northeast Corridor for many Pennsylvanians, I am urging a thorough investigation so we can determine what led to this terrible crash and what can be done to prevent such tragedies in the future. You can watch coverage from my visit here and here. National Police Week This week is National Police Week -- a time to show our support and appreciation for the brave men and women who put on the uniform each day to protect us. Recently, I visited the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, D.C. to pay my respects to our fallen officers, especially Pennsylvania State Trooper Corporal Bryon Dickson. Corporal Dickson was killed last year in the line of duty, and his name was recently etched into the stone at this important memorial. You can see his name in the photo above, just above my hand. Our police men and women are dedicated public servants who put their lives on the line every day in the name of serving and protecting. Our police have incredibly difficult and important jobs to do. I am grateful for our law enforcement officials, and next time you see a police officer, I encourage you to thank him or her. You can watch my video address on National Police Week here. Cutting Government Waste This week, I spoke at a press conference hosted by Citizens Against Government Waste (CAGW) to call for an end to wasteful government spending. We have made progress in the last few years, and more in the last few weeks, including passing legislation that balances the budget in nine years. I also introduced bipartisan legislation earlier this year to permanently end earmarks. I will continue to work toward a government that is more effective and more accountable. My efforts to rein in spending and reduce deficits will put our country on a sustainable fiscal path, grow the economy, and help create jobs. We need a government that does not burden future generations with massive debts and is also accountable to those who pay the bills - the taxpayers. You can read more about this press conference here. Groundbreaking Discoveries In Pennsylvania On Monday, I visited the Perelman School of Medicine at the University of Pennsylvania. I met with Dr. Carl June, M.D., a professor of immunotherapy. The work he is doing at UPenn is groundbreaking. His research is producing some astonishing results by harnessing the body's immune system to rid patients of their cancer. Senator Roy Blunt (R-Mo.) was in Philadelphia and joined me on campus. I was proud to show my colleague the state-of-the-art facilities and research being done in our state. Photo Journal I met with a group of women this week dedicated to public service. We discussed ways we can work together to ensure our communities continue to grow and thrive, and I updated them on the many accomplishments of the Senate so far this year including passing a balanced budget, the Keystone pipeline, the Clay Hunt Veterans Suicide Prevention bill, and a long-overdue bipartisan fix for Medicare's payment formula for doctors.  I got the chance to meet with representatives from the Pennsylvania Asian Indian Community from Central Pennsylvania. It was a beautiful day, and one of the participants told me he wants to run for office! I sat down with folks from A Second Chance - an organization dedicated to strengthening and preserving healthy families for children.

[R-CO6]","Congressman Mike Coffman - Serving the 6th District of Colorado ========================================================= [image =  Dear Friends: The Aurora VA hospital, which readers of this newsletter are well aware has long been a major problem, isnowlooking at even more trouble due totheintransigence of the VA. After the Army Corps of Engineers came on the project a few months ago, at my insistence,itdeterminedthat theVAs plans actually costaboutthreetimes the original budgeted amount. Once that was announced,Ifullyexpected the VA would find ways to bring down the cost from the newly-estimated $1.73 billionbut to date it has not done so. In fact, the VA was asked at numerous Congressional hearings to identify ways to bring the cost downand warned that doing so was essential to the project moving forward. Unfortunately,theVAhasso far refused to cut a penny from the project, anditsrefusal hasnowput future funding to complete the hospital at risk. Not only that, but the VAs solution is a proposal topay for the nearly billion dollars in cost overruns by delaying other veterans projects around the country. My colleagues in Congress have made it clear, repeatedly, thatdivertingfundsmeantfor theirstatesveterans to pay for the VAs mismanagementof the hospital inAurorais a non-starter. This is unfortunately not the first time the VA has kept itshead lodged firmly in the sand. It took theVAover two years to even acknowledge that the Aurora VA hospital was over budget,despite my efforts since 2013 to makeits leadershiprealize how out-of-control the hospital construction project had become. The VA only admitted it even had a problem after the general contractor forced the VA into litigation where it was dealt a stinging rebuke and lost on all of the contractors claims. Now the VA is refusing to acknowledge what Congress has been tellingitfor months. The entire Colorado delegation has been urging the VA to adapt to the realitiesit hascreated. With the project expected to run out of funds at the end of the month, I urge the VA to wake up and get Congress a plan, and fast. This time the plan needs tolower the cost of the completing the project and find ways to pay for the remaining cost overruns through reforms that lead to cost savings within the VA instead of shortchanging veterans in other states. It remains my top priority to make sure that this hospital is completed to serve those who have served us but I cant do this alone and the VA has to do its part.

The hearing Thursday was based on a whistleblower's letter which said the Department of Veterans Affairs illegally spent up to $6 billion a year using purchase cards without proper contracts. The practice had been going on for years. The improper charge card spending allegations include exceeding authorized purchase limits, inadequate financial controls prohibiting duplicative or split payments, and inadequate recording or reporting of financial information. ""By using the card, the purchasers simply ignore that process they are able to liquidate the unauthorized commitment,"" said whistleblower Jan Frye, VA Deputy Assistant Secretary for Acquisition and Logistics. ""No pain, no stain. Nobody ever knows."" Frye says VA employees were using the charge cards, known as purchase cards, to buy pharmaceuticals or medical devices such as prosthetics without written contracts, and Frye said the card usage opened the process up to fraud, waste and abuse. Edward Murray, the VA's Acting Assistant Secretary for Management, said he was made aware of the allegations just hours before the hearing at the House Veterans Affairs Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. When asked whether the purchase card practices were right or wrong, Murray said, ""A lot of different parts of the organization have looked at this issue, and there are different views on this issue."" ""You are doing absolutely nothing to make a difference on this issue, and I am very disappointed in your testimony today,""* *subcommittee chairman* Mike Coffman*, R-CO, told Murray. *Free for Kids* Starting March 25, general admission to the *Denver Art Museum* *is* *FREE* to all youth 18 and under *every day*. *100 W 14th Ave Pkwy, Denver, CO 80204*  *VA Official: McDonald Silent After Warning of Billions Misspent* *By: Travis Tritten* *Stars and Stripes* [link 7] *Published May 14, 2015* The head of procurement at the Department of Veterans Affairs said Thursday that Secretary Bob McDonald never contacted him after a warning in March that the agency is misspending billions of dollars each year. Jan Frye, deputy assistant secretary for acquisition and logistics, detailed to House lawmakers how he blew the whistle on the agencys questionable credit card purchases and how VA officials testifying along with him planned in advance to hide the wrongdoing. The VA was hit with its newest scandal just before the hearing Thursday when a March letter written by Frye to McDonald was made public. It unveiled that at least $5 billion and as much as $10 billion each year in employee credit card purchases were made without contracts and in violate of federal procurement rules. I have not had any response from the secretarys office, Frye testified to a Veterans Affairs subcommittee. He said an assistant to McDonald and Deputy Secretary Sloan Gibson confirmed both had received the letter. Frye also told members of a House Armed Services subcommittee that VA leadership, including its chief financial officer and its chief procurement officer for the departments health care system, were testifying Thursday in hopes of obscuring the purchase practices. We hope you wont ask us any questions that will force us to tell you about the important pieces weve premeditatedly left out, he testified. If you happen to ask us about what weve failed to tell you, we hope we can answer your questions in such a way as to quickly extinguish potential follow-on questions. In short, obfuscation is our game. About 23,000 VA employees have credit cards designed to streamline smaller purchases, but the cards were also used to buy health care and medical devices such as prosthetics without required contracts, which opens the agency up to overpayments, defective products and fraud, according to Frye. Frye said he wrote to McDonald in March after years of pressing the agency to clean up purchases. The secretary was confirmed by Congress last summer to revive the VA from its biggest scandal  the manipulation of patient wait times at veterans hospitals across the country  and has often spoke publicly about the value of whistleblowers. Edward Murray, acting VA assistant secretary for management and the interim CFO, testified to the House subcommittee that he had never seen Fryes letter to McDonald before Thursday. I just found out about this letter this morning, he testified. Some of Fryes claims had recently been discussed by a working group within the VA, Murray said. He agreed that the VA needs to do more and said that McDonald is also working to change the culture in the agency, which is one of the federal governments largest bureaucracies. I believe I am working with him, and me and my staff are working our very utmost to make the staff more accountable and transparent, Murray said. He said the agency has made tremendous strides in fixing its long-troubled purchase card program, including a list of improvements after a scathing audit by the VA inspector general last year that found 15,600 potentially unauthorized card purchases worth $85.6 million. The testimony raised the ire of some lawmakers. I guess Im dumbfounded, said Rep. Tim Huelskamp, R-Kan. Youre here to speak for the VA  and youve never seen the allegations in Fryes letter. *Rep. Mike Coffman*, R-Colo., chairman of the House subcommittee, said the VA attempted to block Frye from testifying in yet another attempt to avoid responding in a fully open and candid manner but relented at the last moment. *Coffman* said the agency wanted to only send Murray, who has been in his position for about two months and does not have a full grasp of the long-term purchase card problems. The VA purchase card program has been troubled by a lack of oversight since the 1990s, according to various audits, but the claims by Frye would be a massive increase in misuse over the past five years, a period when agency purchases more than doubled. I hope VA is embarrassed and ashamed about the way they treat people who try to bring problems forward, said Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Fla., chairman of the full Veterans Affairs Committee. I am tired of hearing the same thing over and over and over again. Nothing is changing regardless of what leadership is telling this committee. ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- [link 1] [link 2] [link 3] [link 4] [link 5] [link 6] [link 7] ========================================================= OFFICES Washington Office ------------------ 2443 Rayburn HOB Washington, D.C. 20515 Phone: (202) 225-7882 Fax: (202) 226-4623 District Office ---------------- Cherry Creek Place IV 3300 S.

[R-TX]","Greetings, We pray for the people throughout the state, and especially in East, Texas, as they continue to recover from the devastating storms that destroyed homes and businesses early this week. It has been remarkable to see our communities come together to help and support our neighbors. Keep Texas strong, Ted Cruz  Sen. Cruz Introduces Commercial Space Launch Act On Tuesday, Sen. Cruz filedthe Commercial Space Launch Act of 2015 (CSLA) with U.S. Sens. Bill Nelson (D-Fla.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), and Cory Gardner (R-Colo.) that extends the International Space Station (ISS) until 2024 and ensures stability for the continued development and growth of the U.S. commercial space sector, among other initiatives. In 1984, President Reagan ushered in a new era of space exploration when he signed the first Commercial Space Launch Act, which recognized the vital role the private sector plays, along with NASA, that will contribute to continued American leadership in space, said Sen. Cruz. The 2015 Commercial Space Launch Act builds on that legacy, keeps the ISS operational through 2024, and encourages dynamic growth of the commercial space industry both here in Texas and across the country. Various leaders within the space industry have voiced their support for Sen. Cruz's legislation, including the following: Wayne Rast, Executive Director, Texas Space Alliance: The Texas Space Alliance (TXA) and applauds the noble and heroic efforts being undertaken to advance the cause of space, led by Space, Science and Competitiveness subcommittee Texas Chairman Sen. Cruz, with help from the Texas delegation on the vitally needed Commercial Space Launch Act. The TXA unreservedly calls for of passage of the CLSA, and solicits all actors in the space arena to work together to make CLSA a reality. Bob Mitchell, President, Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership: The Bay Area Houston Economic Partnership supports the development of commercial space capabilities, especially those associated with cargo and crew support to the International Space Station, as part of a balanced space exploration program that includes timely development of the Orion spacecraft and the Space Launch System for human deep space missions, as well as extended operations of scientific research aboard the International Space Station. We are very excited to see the strong support of the ISS extension to 2024 and beyond. John Sharp, Chancellor, The Texas A&M University System: We are pleased to see that the draft includes an extension of the ISS through at least 2024, and supports continued research experiments and test bed opportunities. Thank you again for your efforts on this legislation and your leadership on NASA issues. SpaceX: SpaceX supports the Senate's U.S. Commercial Space Launch Act that will help to strengthen overall U.S. commercial space competitiveness, and looks forward to continuing working with Congress as the legislation moves forward. See additional quotes of support here. Sen. Cruz Files Amendment to TPA Legislation On Wednesday, Sen. Cruz filed an amendment to the Trade Act of 2015 to lock in assurances that this legislation cannot be used to change federal immigration law. The Obama Administration has repeatedly assured Members of Congress that there is nothing in the Trade Act of 2015 that would allow the President to unilaterally make changes to federal immigration laws. I agree, and we should put it in writing and make it binding law, said Sen. Cruz. I am a strong supporter of free trade, but I cannot support legislation that would allow the President to once again circumvent Congress to enact his own immigration laws. Since the Obama Administration has emphatically argued that TPA will not affect immigration, it should support this amendment, which makes that promise explicit. The amendment states that nothing in the Trade Act of 2015 or in any trade agreement subject to the Act shall alter or affect any law, regulation, or policy relating to immigration. The amendment also states that any fast-track procedures shall not apply to any implementing bill submitted with respect to a trade agreement that includes any provision that alters or affects any law, regulation, or policy relating to immigration.  Sen. Cruz Sends Letter to Secretary of StateExpressing Concern for Iran Human Rights Violations U.S. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-Texas), along with Sens. Mike Enzi (R-Wyo.), Johnny Isakson (R-Ga.), Mark Kirk (R-Ill.), David Perdue (R-Ga.), and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), today sent a letter to U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry expressing strong concern over the ongoing postponement of the State Department's Iran Human Rights Report. States that routinely oppress their own citizens as a method of survival lack legitimacy and pose security threats to their neighbors, the senators wrote. Accordingly, the question of Iran's nuclear ambitions and its human rights record are inextricably intertwined. Read the full letter here. Sen. Cruz Sends Letter to the CFPB to Ensure Businesses Are Not Unfairly Targeted On Friday, Sen. Cruz sent a letter to Consumer Financial Protection Bureau Director Richard Cordray requesting that he publicly make clear that the agency will not participate in Operation Choke Point or any similar initiative. Operation Choke Point, as the letter explains is an enforcement initiative designed to pressure banks and other financial institutions to terminate the accounts of certain politically disfavored businesses, such as casinos, tobacco distributors, payment processers, and short-term lenders. Even gun stores, which engage in constitutionally protected activity under the Second Amendment, were targeted. Based on this initiative, Sen. Cruz expressed concern that the CFPB may be participating in similar discrimination: The recent lawsuit you filed against various debt collectors and payment processers concerns us greatly, as the suit targets certain payment processors that even you acknowledge did nothing illegal, Sen. Cruz wrote. Read the full letter here.  A Regional Update from East Texas Regional Director Daniel Alders Severe weather has brought unexpected trials to many Texans, and our team has been working hard to assist those in need. From damaging tornadoes in North and East Texas, and severe floods across the state, to a sinkhole in Granbury, many have suffered loss. We lift them up in our thoughts and prayers. The East Texas town of Van was hit especially hard, suffering loss of lives and significant damage to the town. I have been on the ground receiving updates from local officials and offering support for emergency responders and the Red Cross to ensure that Texans have all they need to recover. I want to thank the Red Cross for opening six shelters to families who lost lodging, for sending more than 70 disaster workers to affected areas, and providing roughly 1,000 meals to those who have been displaced. We will keep partnering with the community to restore affected areas.

[R-GA]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email   Homepage  Contact Me  Issues & Legislation  Constituent Services  Newsroom  A Weekly e-Newsletter from Senator Johnny Isakson (R-GA) May 15, 2015 Dear Friends, As chairman of the Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs, I made it a personal commitment to make sure the Department of Veterans Affairs rises to meet the challenge of implementing necessary reforms on behalf of all of America's veterans. In late April, I made a trip with the committee to host a field hearing regarding the Department of Veterans Affairs construction of a new medical center in Denver, Colo. The cost of the facility has climbed to $1.7 billion, which is hundreds of millions of dollars over budget and makes this project the most expensive hospital construction in the VA's history. The committee made it very clear at the April 24, 2015, hearing that we expected a full report from the VA about its plans to address the unacceptable surge in costs, delays and mismanagement of the construction at the replacement Denver VA Medical Center. Because of a near complete and total lack of focus on the project at the highest levels of VA and the department's disregard for congressional oversight, the future of the Denver replacement hospital is unclear. Instead of putting forth a realistic plan for covering the enormous cost overruns in Denver by finding efficiencies in its existing budget and eliminating waste, VA has essentially demanded that taxpayers subsidize the department's incompetence with an $830 million bailout. Incredibly, VA is asking for this bailout in the absence of any accountability whatsoever for the problems in Denver while just today the public learned the department is improperly spending as much as $6 billion on procurements per year. Congress will not tolerate any more empty VA promises. So if the department is serious about getting the Denver project back on track, it needs to show us rather than tell us. I issued a statement along with U.S. Rep. Jeff Miller, R-Calif., who serves as chair of the U.S. House Veterans' Affairs Committee yesterday. To read the entire statement, click here  . Fighting Obama's Unilateral Immigration Amnesty This week, I continued my fight against the president's unilateral amnesty actions. I joined my colleagues in the U.S. House and Senate to file an amicus brief with the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals on behalf of Georgia and 25 other states, arguing that President Obama's unilateral, deferred-action programs for illegal immigrants are unconstitutional.  The amicus brief was filed in the case of Texas v. United States. Oral arguments were heard by the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals on April 17, 2015. The U.S. District Court in Texas said in February that President Obama's action on immigration is illegal.  Any attempt to circumvent Congress and grant amnesty to millions in this country illegally is unacceptable and unconstitutional. The president continues to circumvent Congress by executive action, and if Congress must use the courts to force the president to follow the laws he has sworn to uphold, then so be it. Reigning in the EPA This week, I co-sponsored the Affordable Reliable Energy Now Act to roll back the Environmental Protection Agency's proposed new rule to regulate greenhouse gas emissions from existing power plants. The Affordable Reliable Energy Now Act will ensure reliable and affordable energy, put jobs and the economy first and curb federal overreach. For more information about this legislation, click here  . Providing Quality Care for our Veterans At a Senate Committee on Veterans' Affairs hearing on Tuesday, I expressed my desire to have a partnership between the private sector and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) in its implementation of the Veterans Choice Act. If private contractors and the agency can't work together seamlessly, the Veterans Choice Program will never work.  Also, I questioned Sloan Gibson, deputy secretary of the VA, about what the VA is doing to ensure that each VA Medical Center has implemented the program correctly,  and I shared concerns that the culture in lower levels of the Veterans Health Administration does not support health care choices for veterans. The entire hearing is available to view here  . Truck Rule Would Save Lives On Thursday, Sen. David Perdue and I called on the Obama administration to act expeditiously to adopt a long-overdue and much-needed safety measure that would require large trucks to have speed limit devices to cap maximum speeds  to a predetermined mileage-per-hour. This proposed mandate has the ability to greatly reduce the number of accidents caused by speeding trucks that often result in serious injury or death. In a letter to U.S. Secretary of Transportation Anthony Foxx  , we voiced serious concerns over the numerous negligent delays that have occurred since 2011 on issuance of the Department of Transportation's long-overdue rule to mandate electronic speed limiting devices on the country's heaviest trucks. Had this life-saving measure already been enacted as promised more than six years ago, it could have prevented the deaths of five young nursing students who were run over by a tractor-trailer truck while traveling on Interstate 16 between Statesboro and Savannah, Ga., on April 22, 2015. This is an issue I have been pressing with the U.S. Department of Transportation for some time, and it is time for full implementation. Helping Americans Prepare for Retirement On Wednesday, I introduced the Lifetime Income Disclosure Act, S. 267, to help Americans plan in advance to help ensure they do not outlive their retirement savings.  This legislation would help provide Americans annual statements with their projected monthly income based on the current balance of their 401(k). This information not only helps Americans to plan, but also helps them to save more during their working years. Georgia News  Last weekend, I had the pleasure of hosting one of my favorite annual events, Military Academy Day, at Dobbins Air Reserve Base in Marietta, Ga. More than 1,200 Georgians attended this special opportunity to learn about attending our nation's service academies. I also spoke at a summit on Monday in Atlanta with Sen. Bob Corker, R-Tenn., about ending the scourge of human trafficking. In April, the Senate passed the Justice for Victims of Trafficking Act  by a vote of 99-0. I was also delighted to greet students and families from across Georgia in my Washington, D.C., office this week.

,114,Male,N00026163,43417,"Westmoreland, Lynn (Rep.) [R-GA3]","Congressman Lynn Westmoreland - 3rd District of Georgia May is Military Appreciation Month On the last Monday in May each year, our nation remembers the lives of those brave Americans who gave their lives for our freedom. Memorial Day is a widely known day, but many dont know that back in 1999, the entire month of May was declared Military Appreciation Month. Its a month long celebration to honor those who have given their life, served, or currently serve our nation. We are blessed to have such dedicated soldiers who defend our nation and fight for liberty and freedom for all. As a community, its our responsibility to give back to those who gave their all for us. During Military Appreciation Month, I encourage you to look for ways to thank those who have served or currently serve in our military. You can create a care package to send to our troops, greet service men and women coming home at the airport, or write a thank you note to your grandparent or neighbor for their service. Military Appreciation Month doesnt stop at those who serve, but includes the spouses, children, families, friends, and communities of those who serve. Their love and support provide our soldiers strength for the battles they face coming home.  As your Congressman, I can also assist veterans by serving as an advocate between the veteran and the Veterans Administration. My office can help get a case moving along and make sure the veteran receives the benefits they put their life on the line for. I will also continue to support legislation in Congress that ensures our troops have the tools they need to combat terrorism and to keep our country safe. I will continue to support solutions to reform and improve the Veterans Administration so our soldiers get the mental and physical help they need. Without our brave service men and women, our nation would not be the greatest in the world as it is today. During this month and all the days of the year, may we never forget all those who gave the ultimate sacrifice, and let us be forever grateful for those who fight for our ability to live free. **** House Votes to Protect Farmers From EPA Overreach Tuesday, I voted in support of H.R. 1732, the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act, to protect Georgia farmers from proposed regulations by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA). H.R. 1732 upholds the integrity of the federal-state partnership to regulate our nations waters by preserving existing rights and responsibilities with respect to waters of the United States under the Clean Water Act. The EPA is constantly trying to bypass state and local governments, when they are the ones that know the land and water sources the best. Ive spoken to farmers across the Third District and the state of Georgia, and this overreach onto their property is a huge concern to them. Weve seen the EPA regulating outside its authority time and time again, and we will continue to fight to put an end to it. Under the EPAs proposed rule, the Clean Water Act could regulate waters in ditches, man-made ponds, floodplains, streams, and seasonally-wet areas  burdening and even threatening jobs in the agricultural industry. The Regulatory Integrity Protection Act gives the EPA and Army Corps of Engineers 30 days to withdraw the current proposed rule and requires them to develop a new proposed rule that must take into consideration local and state concerns. The Regulatory Integrity Protection Act requires the federal government to work with state and local communities to find a solution that best fits their needs. By restoring trust, transparency, and integrity to the decision making process, we can find a solution that protects both our water and our jobs, and isnt just in the interest of Washington bureaucrats  but for the farmers and hard-working Americans who provide for our nation. **** Westmoreland Votes to Protect Americas Unborn Children The U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 36, the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. This bill prohibits abortions after 20 weeks  the point at which babies can feel pain in the womb. In addition to supporting H.R. 36, I am an original co-sponsor of H.R. 426, the Sanctity of Life Act, which declares that human life begins with fertilization. As a father of three and a grandfather of seven, protecting the life of an unborn child is my responsibility not only as a member of Congress, but as a Christian. Life begins at conception, and just as we protect those who have already been born we must also do for those who have yet to be born. Expanding the ban on late-term abortions to national policy protects more human lives, and the Sanctity of Life Act will give more innocent children a chance at life. Their lives are the most vulnerable and we must be the voice for the voiceless. H.R. 36, the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is supported by numerous pro-life organizations, including the National Right to Life Committee, and the bill now heads to the Senate for a vote. H.R. 426, the Sanctity of Life Act will be sent to the House Judiciary Committee to be scheduled for a hearing, and I urges the committee to quickly bring it to a vote. **** In Other News Westmoreland: Spring 2015 I've been staying busy both in Washington, D.C. and back home in GA-03.

,114,Female,N00033106,43627,"Wagner, Ann (Rep.) [R-MO2]","A message from Congresswoman Ann Wagner  About  Contact  Services  Media Center  Issues  Dear Lindsey, This was a momentous week in Washington, wherein the House passed historic pro-life legislation, we recognized the courageous service of our countrys police officers and we pause to thank members of the armed forces. Armed Forces Day Today we come together as proud Americans to celebrate the patriotic service of the members of our Armed Forces.  The immense pride I have for my son, who just recently earned his captains bars, extends to all members of our military. Our men and women in uniform work every day to secure our freedom and liberty. So today, as we celebrate Armed Forces Day, I would like to extend my heartfelt appreciation and deepest gratitude to those who serve our country with honor and distinction.  Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act I believe that life begins at conception. In the time since the controversial decision in Roe v. Wade, we have made incredible discoveries about just how advanced unborn children really are. In fact, at 20 weeks after conception, there is strong evidence that these babies can feel the pain caused by an abortion. You can view my floor speech in support of life here:  On May 13, 2015, the U.S. House passed H.R. 36, the Pain- Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, with my support. H.R. 36 makes it illegal for anyone to perform an abortion more than 20 weeks after conception. While I believe that killing an unborn child is unacceptable at any time, it is especially abhorrent at the 20-week mark when a child is able to feel the pain of abortion.  I am for life at all stages. I am for the life of the baby and I am also for the life of the mother. I will continue to work toward the day when abortion is not only illegal, but absolutely unthinkable. National Police Week It was great to speak with St. Louis County Chief of Police Col. Jon Belmar and Deputy Chief of Police Lt. Col. Kenneth Cox, who were in Washington to participate in National Police Week. We owe Col. Belmar, Lt. Col. Cox and all police officers a great debt of gratitude for their service and keeping us safe.  H.R. 1732 Regulatory Integrity Protection Act Last week, the U.S. House of Representatives passed H.R. 1732 in a bipartisan fashion to protect Missouri farmers from the controversial EPA Waters of the United States rule. In true bureaucratic fashion, the Environmental Protection Agency and Army Corps of Engineers have created more problems than solutions for hardworking farmers across our country. Endless rules and red tape hinder the livelihoods of Missouri farmers every day, but last week we fought back, blocking the expanded definition of EPA-regulated waters and preventing yet another power grab from a bloated, overzealous government agency. Constituent Groups Last week I had the opportunity to meet with several great groups from St. Louis. Ann meets with Craig and Janet Mathis with the ALS Society of St. Louis. Ann meets with Craig and Janet Mathis with the ALS Society of St. Louis.  Ann with the ALS Society of St. Louis  Ann speaks about public service with members of the Coros Foundation.

[R-MO4]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email   About Me  | Contact Me  | Serving You  | Media Center  | Legislative Work  | Our District  | Resources  Dear Friend, This was an incredibly busy week in Washington. The House passed a number of bills with great importance to you and the rest of Missouris Fourth. I am particularly happy to tell you the House voted on and passed the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act, a bill of which I was an original co-sponsor. Recently I told you it had passed out of committee, and I shared with you some moments from the press conference I held regarding this bill. This legislation forces the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to withdraw the flawed Waters of the U.S. rule and actually listen to the states and citizens when crafting a new rule to define navigable water.  Congresswoman Hartzler speaks at a March press conference on the need to abolish the EPAs Waters rule (click on the picture to watch the video). The EPA overstepped its bounds when it made this rule, to the detriment of our farmers, county road departments, developers, and the jobs and local economies they support. I am very pleased this bill has passed and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to take it up and pass it quickly so we can return authority of the land back to those who know it best. We also passed a very important piece of legislation to defend the defenseless - H.R. 36, the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act  which I was privileged to help craft. If enacted, the bill would save the lives of unborn babies after 20 weeks of pregnancy where medical evidence shows they can feel pain, and where real life examples have shown they can live.  Congresswoman Hartzler speaks in support of H.R. 36, sharing the story of Miracle Micah. (click on the picture to watch the video) Miracle Micah is a shining example of what this bill is meant to do. Micah, born at 20 weeks post-fertilization, was given a grim prognosis on life. His parents, Danielle and Clayton, did not give up hope, despite the constant reminder from doctors that their son was not viable. Today, Micah is a happy and healthy boy; experiencing all the joys life has to offer. I would encourage you to read this letter  that Danielle sent to the House Values Action Team  , a group of House members I am a co-chair of, which tells Micahs amazing story.  A happy and healthy Micah. H.R. 36 will save other babies who, like Micah, are viable. It will prevent them from being aborted and give them a chance to live. Sadly, America is one of only seven countries in the world that allow abortions at this stage. All life is sacred, and we must protect it. I have long said that one of the fundamental obligations of Congress is to provide for a strong national defense. We took a major step this week to do that as the full House took up and passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2016. This bill provides the resources needed to address existing national security threats as well as developing threats from rogue nations and terrorist groups around the globe. Additionally, through much-needed reforms and significant waste-cutting measures, this NDAA looks to make our military a more agile, efficient, and prepared force.  Congresswoman Hartzler speaks on the House floor in in opposition to an amendment to the FY2016 NDAA which would have closed Gauntanamo. Congresswoman Hartzler is the Chairwoman of the subcommittee investigating the Bowe Bergdahl/Taliban 5 swap. (click on the picture to watch the video) This bill contains a number of provisions I championed that will boost jobs and local economies in Missouri and ensure that Whiteman Air Force Base and Fort Leonard Wood remain the vital national security installations they are today. I look forward to the Senate passing its version so we can finalize the bill and give our troops the resources needed to protect our citizens. Lastly, we passed a measure aimed at making sure our interests are protected in negotiations on a nuclear-armed Iran. The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 passed with strong bipartisan support, 400-25, and would give Congress oversight and approval authority on any deal that may be struck. Americans and our friends and allies, such as Israel, are rightly concerned with the thought of a nuclear Iran and the dangers associated with it Passing this bill gives Americans, through their elected representatives in Congress, the authority to stop a bad deal from happening. On a final note, I wanted to let you know of some of the services my office may be able to offer you. On my webpage, I have a resource center full of handy links, documents, and forms that can help with issues you may be facing.

,114,Male,N00032441,43529,"Nugent, Richard (Rep.) [R-FL11]","News from Representative Richard Nugent  Dear Friends, If you're interested in whether or not the NSA can collect your phone calls, this week's newsletter is for you. And. it's got some good news and bad news. First, the good news. The House passed, in pretty overwhelming fashion, a bill known as the USA Freedom Act. Supporters of the bill, including a great many privacy advocates and news outlets, have hailed the bill as putting an end to the NSA's bulk collection of phone records. In addition, they point out that the bill makes an important move in requiring the presence of a privacy advocate when the secret FISA court reviews NSA requests to gather data on specific people without their knowledge. These are good things. The bad news, at least if you have as little trust in the NSA and its advocates in Congress as I do, there is a very good chance that the records of millions of innocent Americans will remain subject to the federal dragnet. The reasons for that are pretty technical and certainly subject to interpretation, but if past behavior is any indication of what is likely to happen, it's easy enough to explain. In short, the NSA originally based its authority to collect data on most if not all American calls (and mass amounts of email and web traffic as well) on statutory language in the Patriot Act that just about any reasonable layperson would say does NOT give them that authority. Indeed, just in the last couple weeks, a federal court issued a ruling saying that based on the statutory language in question, the NSA did not in fact have that authority. When I look at it, I would tend to agree. Yet the NSA has been doing it anyway for years. So while this new language passed by the House this week does not permit the NSA to store all of that mass data in-house, it does permit them to continue querying it. Indeed, while they will no longer have the data on their own servers, by some interpretations, the restrictions on what can be queried have actually been broadened. In my experience, it's important to maintain a healthy sense of skepticism. For instance, while the NSA itself says it can't monitor electronic communications between Americans on U.S. soil, it does not take the same view of communications that occur overseas. This too gets a bit squirrelly because quite a bit of our web traffic, including email can end up getting bounced across servers overseas before reaching its final destination. Indeed it's quite common for that to happen. Electronic data moves at the speed of light, so it's not nearly as cumbersome as shipping a letter through London to get it from Tampa to Tacoma. That's apparently just the way the internet works. So how restrictive a view do the NSA's lawyers take of these electronic quirks? Is that domestic communication or foreign? Well. it did go overseas, didn't it? You could be forgiven for wondering how far they are likely to push the new statutory language about what they can query. You could also be forgiven for wondering how open and honest are they going to be with your elected representatives in Congress about the actions they are taking based on the ambiguous language Congress passes. Based on my own personal experience, not very. You may recall a hearing a couple years back in which Senator Ron Wyden, a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee asked Director of National Intelligence if the NSA was collecting, ""any type of data at all on millions or hundreds of millions of Americans."" Mr. Clapper's answer? ""No. Not wittingly."" When the Snowden leak came out and uproar ensued, many members of Congress, including myself wanted to know why we had not been briefed that these programs were in place. The NSA sort of shrugged and said that they'd told Congress repeatedly about these programs. Only it was through oblique references in various classified documents that we were only permitted to read in a secure vault without our own staff members present. We couldn't take a copy with us, obviously. And we couldn't bring in our own attorneys, experts, etc. to provide unbiased counsel on what we were looking at. Frankly, even if we could, you'd have to know what you're looking for. And even if you'd found it, you'd have to take them at their word about what X, Y, or Z program name actually did. There's certainly no bold text or highlighted section that says, ""here's where we make very questionable assumptions about what Congress has given us permission to do"". With the benefit of hindsight, when this questionable activity comes to light, it's possible to go back and see the specific verbiage that Congress passed and how that language was stretched to permit activity that most members would not have felt comfortable with. In the rushed days leading up to an authorization vote, particularly in the days after a terrorist attach, it can be tricky to anticipate how language might be used. What looks like very straightforward language restricting the NSA's activities in a reform bill can actually be a very cleverly worded restatement of current law (which the NSA has based their activities on in the first place). The point is, it pays to read carefully and with a very skeptical eye. So, yes, I was a little worried when I saw so many of my colleagues congratulating themselves for having ""put an end"" to the NSA's mass collection of Americans' data. I think it's likely those self-congratulations are a little premature. The fact of the matter is that the NSA has been debating for some time whether it's cost-effective to collect and store all of that data in-house. What they have NOT been debating, and in fact have been fiercely arguing for, is that they need to have access to it. For my money, it doesn't much matter where the physical servers are that hold the data. What matters is can the federal government continue to access, without a specific warrant, the records of millions of innocent Americans - who you talk to, how often you talk, for how long you talk, and so forth. And that's to say nothing of web traffic. If there is one immutable truth, the executive branch will always push the absolute outer limits of what the law authorizes. If you pass a law saying the government may not set foot on my lawn, then they will quickly decide they are gymnasts who can walk on their hands. If you say no part of the government may touch my lawn, then as sure as the sun rises in the east, they will say they can suspend themselves from a tree branch next door just because they aren't physically touching the lawn. So if you feel as strongly as I do that the government has no right to invade your lawn without a warrant, then you better be very careful about how you word permissive language pertaining to vast lawn surveillance programs. I just don't trust them. I don't trust their lawyers. And I don't trust the people in Congress who have backed the NSA's activities - and who, not for nothing, are the same people writing the reform bills. When it comes down to trust without an ability to verify, that's not something I can endorse. Knowing full well that the deadline for reauthorizing these programs was June 1, I don't personally believe they needed to wait until the last minute to show us their new language - wholesome as it may seem. I don't think the bill needed to be rushed to the floor just days before the deadline. I don't think an hour of debate was enough to consider all of the possibilities and concerns. This bill not only made material changes to the NSA's programs, it also extended for several more years some other very controversial authorities under the original PATRIOT Act. None of it was open to amendment. If any of us outside of the room had wanted to change the language on the floor, we couldn't. For something this big and consequential, that's not right. As far as the NSA language is concerned, I can tell you that it does make some meaningful improvements. But what I cannot tell you with certainty is that all of the stories you're reading saying ""it's over"" are even close to correct. It's sad to say, but my gut tells me it's not over. And for all of these reasons and more, I had to vote no.

I wanted to take a minute to make sure that you saw the press release I issued and were able to learn more about the initiative for yourself. You can get more information on my website at  I'll keep you updated as things move forward,  Matt _____ Rep. Salmon Introduces Second Bill to Shrink our Spending Seeks to Defund National Labor Relations Board Washington, D.C.Today, Rep. Matt Salmon (AZ-05) announced his second bill in his newly reintroduced Shrink our Spending Initiative that will highlight and cut wasteful taxpayer-funded programs. Upon introduction of his latest bill to eliminate federal funding for the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), Salmon released the following statement: A great example of government waste is the NLRB, a pro-union labor organization that dictates where businesses can locate, expand, and spend their capital. The U.S. Department of Justice already ensures our labor laws are properly enforced, and does so in a far more professional and nonpartisan manner than the favoritism shown to Big Labor by the NLRB. Congress has many hard choices to make as to where to spend and where to cut, but defunding an agency that does nothing but advance cronyism instead of protecting workers is not one of them. Background: The National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) was officially established in 1935 when President Franklin Roosevelt signed into law Senator Wagners National Labor Relations Act, which, in part, created an independent agency to implement and administer national labor policy. Today, the NLRB has become a vast bureaucratic agency that impedes job growth and economic prosperity. The Department of Justice already oversees a wide variety of civil, criminal, and administrative labor issues, including anti-trust laws, voting rights, and major mergers and acquisitions. In the most recent appropriations legislation, the NLRB received $274,224,000 of your tax dollars. Background on Rep. Salmons SOS Initiative:   Click to watch  Our nation is drowning in debt, over 18 trillion dollars of it. But year after year, our nations leaders continue to approve wasteful spending without a blink, and continue to spend your tax dollars in the most imprudent ways. Enough is enough. We must have the courage to start cutting spending somewhere. Last year, I began a program to identify and cut wasteful spending government-wide, because we know every federal department, office, and agency has wasteful spending within their budgets. I called this program my Shrink Our Spending Initiative and I aimed at finding 1.5 billion dollars in wasteful spendingand it was easy. This year, Im doubling the goal of my SOS Initiative and Ill find 3 billion of your hard-earned tax dollars that the government has decided to fritter away on ineffective, duplicative, or downright wasteful programs.

junior,"112,113,114",Male,N00003682,400325,"Portman, Robert “Rob” (Sen.) [R-OH]","  Constituent Services  Issues & Legislation  Newsroom  About Ohio  About Rob  Connect  Yesterday, U.S. Senator Rob Portman (R-Ohio) participated in his annual turkey hunt, this year in Northeast Ohio.  Portman also visited the Menorah Park Center for Senior Living in Beachwood to announce a pilot project regarding his Better Health Rewards  legislation. Portman and Menorah Park have teamed up to put into place key aspects of this program, which focuses on preventative wellness for seniors.  The Medicare ""Better Health Rewards"" program helps seniors set and reach achievable goals designed to help them get and stay healthy. Unlike the current Medicare system that begins to cost more when a senior actually needs it, the Better Health Rewards program gives seniors who reach their health goals - and help lower overall health costs - a chance to share in the savings. On Monday, Portman, a member of the Senate Homeland Security and Governmental Affairs Committee (HSGAC), appeared on Fox News Channel's The Real Story With Gretchen Carlson  to discuss the latest ISIS terror threats and the Iran nuclear negotiations.  Video of Portman's interview can be found here  . On Tuesday, Portman released the following statement  regarding his vote to allow debate on a package of trade bills: ""I voted to move forward on this package of bills so that I can continue to fight for my priorities of growing American exports, which support good-paying middle-class jobs, while ensuring American workers are competing on a level playing field by putting into place enforceable rules to stop currency manipulation. I told Senate leaders that I need a vote on my currency amendment and I received a commitment that would happen. I will also continue to push for other important enforcement measures that I strongly support, including in the customs bill that passed in committee and would come to the floor separately based on the bipartisan agreement in committee. ""Further, I am pleased that this first package will include an extension of Trade Adjustment Assistance that provides important protections for American workers and families looking to get back on their feet. The TAA bill also includes an extension of the Health Coverage Tax Credit which is vital for Ohio families in Youngstown, Dayton, Sandusky and beyond."" Portman plans to offer his amendment  that puts teeth into addressing currency manipulation by holding countries accountable to International Monetary Fund standards. It would add explicit and enforceable currency language necessary to ensure that foreign competitors don't use their exchange rates to subsidize their exports at the expense of products made by American workers. On Wednesday, Portman and Senator Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) introduced legislation to honor fallen Ohio solider and Bronze Star recipient Daniel Kinnard  by designating the Department of Veterans Affairs Community Based Outpatient Clinic (CBOC) in Newark, Ohio as the Daniel L. Kinnard Department of Veterans Affairs Community Based Outpatient Clinic. A native of Newark, Kinnard served as a medic in Vietnam and was awarded a Bronze Star for selflessly tending to wounded men in his unit while under fire. U.S. Representative Pat Tiberi (R-OH-12) introduced a House version. ""Specialist Kinnard served his country bravely in dire circumstances by caring for and putting his fellow soldiers before himself,"" Portman stated. ""While we can never fully thank him for his service, I'm pleased to introduce this legislation to honor Daniel Kinnard and express gratitude for his extraordinary service to our country."" Text of the legislation can be found here  . Next Monday, Portman will host a roundtable at the Chalmers P. Wylie VA Ambulatory Care Center to focus on mental health treatment for veterans. The Columbus VA Care Center houses a local mental health treatment clinic. As the United States marks National Police Week, Portman on Wednesday joined Senators Chris Coons (D-Del.), Gary Peters (D-Mich.), and Kelly Ayotte (R-N.H.) to introduce bipartisan legislation to close an unintended loophole in the Public Safety Officers' Benefits (PSOB) program and ensure families of fallen and permanently disabled officers receive the benefits they deserve. Families of law enforcement officers, firefighters, and other first responders killed or permanently disabled in the line of duty are entitled to death and education benefits through PSOB, but these benefits are occasionally denied or delayed for the loved ones of officers who suffer severe heat stroke or over-exertion in the course of duty. The Fairness for Fallen Officers Act of 2015 would specify that fatal or permanently disabling climate-related injuries, including hypothermia and hyperthermia resulting from official duties or training in extreme weather conditions, are deserving of full recognition under the law. ""Law enforcement officers make enormous sacrifices to keep our communities safe, and our legislation will ensure that if they tragically fall in the line of duty, their families will receive the benefits they've earned,"" said Portman. ""I'm pleased to introduce this legislation as we recognize National Police Week, and to express gratitude for their continued service."" ""As we recognize National Police Week, the Ohio FOP thanks Senator Portman for helping to ensure that families of fallen officers ?get the benefits they deserve,"" said Ohio FOP President Jay McDonald. On October 9, 2001, Officer Charles McDonald of the Forest Park Police in Ohio tragically died following SWAT training. A medical evaluation later determined that Officer McDonald's death was the result of rhabdomyolosis, a condition caused by extreme overexertion where the skeletal muscles manufacture a toxin that destroys the kidneys. Officer McDonald's family described the process of securing PSOB benefits as long, drawn out, and painful - a process that involved hiring an attorney, obtaining old childhood medical records, and waiting three years for a resolution. The Fairness for Fallen Officers Act of 2015  would guarantee this doesn't happen again, by ensuring climate-related injuries receive full recognition under the PSOB.  Also on Wednesday, Portman urged his colleagues to support his provisions to the customs bill to boost Ohio steel manufacturers and level the playing field for Ohio workers.  Video of his remarks can be found here  . On Thursday, Portman, Chairman of the U.S. Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations (PSI), announced that PSI is investigating mismanagement of the Affordable Care Act health care exchanges  . Working to hold the Administration accountable for Obamacare waste and mismanagement, PSI is reviewing whether adequate verification procedures were in place to ensure that roughly $15 billion in insurance subsidies paid out last year reached the people who actually qualify. Portman expressed concern that reported breakdowns in the process for calculating subsidies have not only been unfair to some consumers who bought insurance through the exchanges but also put taxpayer dollars at risk. ""The Administration assured Congress that the eligibility verification process for the exchanges was working, but millions of Americans are now learning that they received overpayments that they have to repay. I'm concerned that the subsidy eligibility process is so complicated that many consumers believed they were receiving cheaper insurance coverage than they ultimately got. And further verification failures risk wasting billions in hard-earned tax dollars,"" Portman said. In connection with this inquiry, Portman sent a detailed letter to HHS Secretary Sylvia Mathews Burwell raising several important questions concerning the verification-including questions the Administration has failed to answer. PSI also issued a request for documents concerning the reported breakdowns in the verification process for state and federal exchanges so it could conduct its own review. The full text of Portman's letter can be found here  .  Video of Portman discussing the inquiry on Fox News can be viewed here  . Also on Thursday, Portman announced that three of his provisions passed the Senate as part of the customs bill  . Portman welcomed passage of his measure with Senator Brown to ensure steel companies can more easily seek help from illegally undersold and subsidized imports. Portman also welcomed the passage of legislation he's worked on with Senator Ron Wyden (D-Oregon) to crack down on customs duty evasion schemes that hurt American workers through the ENFORCE Act. Finally, Portman welcomed passage of his bill with Senator Claire McCaskill (D-Mo.) that reforms the Miscellaneous Tariff Bill process, building on his efforts to create a level playing field for American manufacturers. ""These measures are crucial to American manufacturers and steelworkers and ensure that they can remain globally competitive,"" Portman stated. ""When competitors cheat they need to be held accountable, and these bipartisan measures will do just that. I'm pleased these provisions have passed the Senate and urge my colleagues in the House to pass this important bill. ""Further, I will be working with Senator Brown to push for enforcement measures to be included next week in the final trade package that will be signed into law."" Portman also urged his colleagues  to support provisions to fight human trafficking in the Trade Promotion Authority legislation. He again called for a balanced approach to trade which includes more exports and stronger trade enforcement to hold foreign competitors accountable when they break trade laws.  Video of Portman's remarks can be found here  . Portman also introduced legislation  on Thursday to ensure that Habitat for Humanity affiliates can continue to receive donated appraisals on the homes they build. The bill makes a technical clarification to a Dodd-Frank regulation that impacts all Habitat for Humanity affiliates. ""This commonsense bill will ensure that all Habitat for Humanity affiliates can fulfill their mission to help qualified families in need without unnecessary government regulations,"" Portman stated. ""I've seen firsthand the good work being done by the organization, and my bill makes a small change that will have a large positive impact for those families relying on Habitat homes.""  On Social Media:    Senate panel probes ObamaCare aid confusion, as customers learn they owe IRS The Senate's top investigative committee has launched an inquiry into the system that's supposed to ensure ObamaCare tax credits go to the right customers for the right amounts - amid concerns that many Americans are getting inflated or improper subsidies. Sen. Rob Portman, R-Ohio, who is leading the investigation, says because of the confusion with the system, millions of Americans are learning after the fact they inadvertently got too much money and now owe the IRS hundreds. ""I'm concerned that the subsidy eligibility process is so complicated that many consumers believed they were receiving cheaper insurance coverage than they ultimately got,"" Portman said in a statement. Portman, chairman of the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations, announced his panel's investigation in a letter sent Thursday to HHS Secretary Sylvia Matthews Burwell. ""I have repeatedly raised questions regarding efforts by the Department of Health and Human Services to prevent improper payments through the exchanges,"" he wrote, saying his prior inquiries were insufficiently answered. Portman cited two investigations into the government's income-verification systems. The Government Accountability Office said in 2014 its investigators secured subsidies using false identities in 11 out of 12 undercover attempts. Also last year, an HHS inspector general report found the department ""did not have procedures or did not follow procedures to ensure"" against government overpayments. Others might have received credits in error because of poor system safeguards, and Portman noted this risks ""wasting billions in hard-earned tax dollars."" Critics say there is still too little known about the effectiveness of the administration's income-verification system. Committee staff is also investigating the state-based exchanges. Portman is requesting HHS name any state running an exchange that has ""stopped attempting to verify applicants' eligibility to enroll in ACA [Affordable Care Act] health care plans or to receive ACA subsidies."" ObamaCare shoppers select insurance plans from state-run exchanges in 13 states and the District of Columbia. Portman's letter to Burwell also references a 2013 federal regulation that allowed, until this year, the administration to rely more on applicants' submitted information than independent verification. That reliance, however, is the foundation of much of the U.S. tax system, noted one ObamaCare supporter and law professor. Portman's letter to Burwell requests responses to more than two dozen questions on the income-verification systems, how they performed during the law's first year and whether any failings were resolved. Only the committee's Republican majority staff is involved in the inquiry, according to Portman. The chairman's letter asked HHS staff to respond by May 29. (""Senate panel probes ObamaCare aid confusion, as customers learn they owe IRS,"" Rich Edson. Fox News  . May 14, 2015.)  Bill proposed to rename VA clinic for fallen native The Veterans Affairs Community Based Outpatient Clinic in Newark may be getting a new name as U.S. Sens. Sherrod Brown and Rob Portman seek to remember one of Newark's fallen heroes. Daniel L. Kinnard, of Newark, died in Vietnam while tending to wounded men in his unit on March 9, 1968. During his time of service, he was honored with a Bronze Star of Valor, a Purple Heart and several other awards. Should the legislation go through, the outpatient clinic at 855 W. Main St. will be named the Daniel L. Kinnard Department of Veterans Affairs Community Based Outpatient Clinic. (""Bill proposed to rename VA clinic for fallen native,"" Staff. Newark Advocate  . May 13, 2015.)  Sen. Rob Portman tours Smale Riverfront Park, gets construction update Senator Rob Portman paid a visit to Smale Riverfront Park Friday to get a firsthand look at the project one day before a new children's play area is set to open. ""I remember growing up, this was an area where there were a lot of warehouses, some of which were abandoned,"" Portman said on his tour. Now Carol Ann's Carousel, Anderson Pavilion, and a children's park occupy the doorstep of Cincinnati. The carousel has 42 hand-carved animal characters. The other hand-painted panels include historic sites around Cincinnati, like Eden Park, the Cincinnati Zoo and Union Terminal. The carousel will be open year-round and cost $2 per ride. The project cost $43 million in donated funds, and $15 million in federal funding. It was also backed by the Army Corp of Engineers. But it is not technically a parks project. Instead, for funding purposes, the project is an erosion control and storm water mitigation project. Much of the development done closest to the river can actually be moved if the Ohio River floods. The projects also have sustainable aspects. ""When you look at the economics of this and you assume you're going to have a million people a year coming down here, the tax revenues that will come from that just from people grabbing burger and a beer,"" Portman said. (""Sen. Rob Portman tours Smale Riverfront Park, gets construction update,"" Staff. WLWT  . May 8, 2015.)  Steadfast ally Israel prompts concerns but offers hope I just returned from a trip to Israel, where I had productive meetings with American and Israeli officials, including Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. My reason for going was to learn firsthand from those on the ground the best way forward in a dangerous and volatile region. Israel's greatest threat resides in Iran, a regime that has been described by the State Department as the No. 1 state sponsor of terrorism. According to the Obama administration, the Iranian regime will be able to produce enough highly enriched uranium for a nuclear weapon in a short period of time, while it supports terrorist groups like Hezbollah and funds other Shi'ite militias as it seeks regional dominance in Iraq, Syria, Yemen, and elsewhere. Like many of my colleagues in the Senate, I have serious concerns about the framework of a possible Iranian nuclear agreement. Our objective must be an enforceable agreement that keeps Iran from becoming a threshold nuclear power. Any deal must include concrete and verifiable steps to prevent Iran from developing nuclear weapons capability. There are many important questions that are raised in the framework agreement. In fact, the Iranian version and the U.S. version of text seem to differ on some of the key details. Attacks on Israel do not always come from rockets, missiles, or other violent means, however. Increasingly, opponents of Israel use economic weapons to target Israel. The boycott, divestment and sanctions movement is an effort to undermine Israel's sovereignty and further isolate it from the international community. Sen. BenCardin, a Democrat from Maryland, and I recently authored the United States-Israel Trade Enhancement Act of 2015. It has a simple purpose. It says that the United States will leverage trade to stop efforts to delegitimize Israel. Finally, I talked to officials at length about the general turmoil in the Middle East and Israel's relationship with its neighbors. This deteriorating regional security environment includes Egypt's battle against radicalism in the Sinai and a volatile Gaza controlled by Hamas, the brutal civil war in Syria, the destabilizing role of Iran-backed Hezbollah fighters in Lebanon and Syria, threats and challenges to our ally Jordan, and the brutality of ISIS. All of this combines to bring me back to the Senate with greater resolve to meet these challenges for our national security and for that of our steadfast ally, Israel.

[R-MO4]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email   About Me  | Contact Me  | Serving You  | Media Center  | Legislative Work  | Our District  | Resources  Dear Friend, This was an incredibly busy week in Washington. The House passed a number of bills with great importance to you and the rest of Missouris Fourth. I am particularly happy to tell you the House voted on and passed the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act, a bill of which I was an original co-sponsor. Recently I told you it had passed out of committee, and I shared with you some moments from the press conference I held regarding this bill. This legislation forces the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to withdraw the flawed Waters of the U.S. rule and actually listen to the states and citizens when crafting a new rule to define navigable water.  Congresswoman Hartzler speaks at a March press conference on the need to abolish the EPAs Waters rule (click on the picture to watch the video). The EPA overstepped its bounds when it made this rule, to the detriment of our farmers, county road departments, developers, and the jobs and local economies they support. I am very pleased this bill has passed and I urge my colleagues in the Senate to take it up and pass it quickly so we can return authority of the land back to those who know it best. We also passed a very important piece of legislation to defend the defenseless - H.R. 36, the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act  which I was privileged to help craft. If enacted, the bill would save the lives of unborn babies after 20 weeks of pregnancy where medical evidence shows they can feel pain, and where real life examples have shown they can live.  Congresswoman Hartzler speaks in support of H.R. 36, sharing the story of Miracle Micah. (click on the picture to watch the video) Miracle Micah is a shining example of what this bill is meant to do. Micah, born at 20 weeks post-fertilization, was given a grim prognosis on life. His parents, Danielle and Clayton, did not give up hope, despite the constant reminder from doctors that their son was not viable. Today, Micah is a happy and healthy boy; experiencing all the joys life has to offer. I would encourage you to read this letter  that Danielle sent to the House Values Action Team  , a group of House members I am a co-chair of, which tells Micahs amazing story.  A happy and healthy Micah. H.R. 36 will save other babies who, like Micah, are viable. It will prevent them from being aborted and give them a chance to live. Sadly, America is one of only seven countries in the world that allow abortions at this stage. All life is sacred, and we must protect it. I have long said that one of the fundamental obligations of Congress is to provide for a strong national defense. We took a major step this week to do that as the full House took up and passed the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2016. This bill provides the resources needed to address existing national security threats as well as developing threats from rogue nations and terrorist groups around the globe. Additionally, through much-needed reforms and significant waste-cutting measures, this NDAA looks to make our military a more agile, efficient, and prepared force.  Congresswoman Hartzler speaks on the House floor in in opposition to an amendment to the FY2016 NDAA which would have closed Gauntanamo. Congresswoman Hartzler is the Chairwoman of the subcommittee investigating the Bowe Bergdahl/Taliban 5 swap. (click on the picture to watch the video) This bill contains a number of provisions I championed that will boost jobs and local economies in Missouri and ensure that Whiteman Air Force Base and Fort Leonard Wood remain the vital national security installations they are today. I look forward to the Senate passing its version so we can finalize the bill and give our troops the resources needed to protect our citizens. Lastly, we passed a measure aimed at making sure our interests are protected in negotiations on a nuclear-armed Iran. The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015 passed with strong bipartisan support, 400-25, and would give Congress oversight and approval authority on any deal that may be struck. Americans and our friends and allies, such as Israel, are rightly concerned with the thought of a nuclear Iran and the dangers associated with it Passing this bill gives Americans, through their elected representatives in Congress, the authority to stop a bad deal from happening.

In November 2013, I was an original co-sponsor of a Senate resolution calling on the government of Iran to immediately release Pastor Abedini.

And now, with the 2016 elections on the horizon, most pundits agree that upward mobility will be the defining issue of this presidential campaign season. And for good reason. It is impossible to ignore the opportunity crisis in America today. Up and down our society we see the symptoms of immobility. At the bottom of the income scale theres the problem of intergenerational poverty, while at the top we see crony capitalism artificially propping up economic and political elites. Caught in the middle are working families struggling just to keep up. Earning the trust of the American people in 2016 will require presidential candidates to have concrete proposals to address each level of Americas immobility crisis. They would be wise to look to Utah as a model. Last week one of my hometown papers, the Deseret News,penned [link 2]an editorial exploring why Salt Lake City is one of the top three most upwardly mobile metro areas in America, according to a recent study. * ""Its time we give the American people the power they need to stabilize their families, strengthen their neighborhoods, improve their schools, expand their transportation networks, grow their businesses, and invest in their civic and religious institutions.""* There are many reasons Utah is such fertile ground for opportunity, but the most important lesson from the study is that inequality of opportunity is more of a local problem than one that needs massive federal intervention. This is something weve known for a long time. Yet policymakers and bureaucrats in Washington, D.C., ever confident in their ability to solve everyone elses problems, continue to insist on taking power away from the American people and their elected representatives at the state and local level. Its time we reverse this trend of consolidating power and resources in Washington. Its time we give the American people the power they need to stabilize their families, strengthen their neighborhoods, improve their schools, expand their transportation networks, grow their businesses, and invest in their civic and religious institutions.  Theres no doubt that the Utah model of upward mobility can be replicated across the country. But to get there, well need presidential candidates who recognize that theres nothing the American people cant do if given the opportunity.  Working together to spread the positive message of conservative reform* [image = Shot 2015-01-16 at 11_28_53 AM.png] [link 3] *To watch the full video CLICK HERE [link 4]*  *Issue In Focus: Fixing Head Start** The history of federal early childhood education policy is a case study in good intentions being used to justify terrible outcomes. No one can object to the intentions of pre-K programs like Head Start, which was created in 1965, as part of the federal government's war on poverty, to provide low-income children with a preschool education. Yet decades of social science research have shown that Head Start has utterly failed to improve the lives of the children and families it ostensibly serves. [image = mountain of evidence includes a 2012 study by President Obama's own Department of Health and Human Services, which showed that whatever benefits children gain from the program disappear by the time they reach the third grade. And this despite commanding an annual operating budget of more than $8 billion. This isnt an indictment of early childhood education. Its an indictment of the failed Washington bureaucracy that has failed to deliver it to Head Start students for more than forty years. We know that a good education starting at a young age is an essential ingredient for upward economic mobility later in life. But we also know that improving the cognitive, social, and behavioral skills of low-income children isnt as simple as appropriating more taxpayer dollars to fund the same broken system. Thats what weve been trying for decades and it hasnt worked. Instead, we need to try something we know will work: empowering parents, educators, and local policymakers to design their early childhood education programs to meet the unique needs of their communities. We could start by eliminating the federal Head Start bureaucracy and block granting its budget to the states. This would allow those closest to the children and families being served to establish their own unique programs and designate eligible public and private pre-schools to receive grants. The data is clear: blindly funding the broken status quo only perpetuates the pattern of failure. We must break this cycle. We owe it to our children and to our nations future.

[R-PA6]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email  News from Representative Ryan Costello  Ryans Report: May 11- May 15, 2015 Thank you for reading my weekly e-newsletter. This week was a difficult one for our region with the tragic derailment of the Amtrak Northeast Regional Train 188 in the Frankford section of Philadelphia. Like many of my constituents, I frequently travel on Amtrak to and from work so this certainly hits home for so many in Southeast Pennsylvania. My thoughts and prayers go out to all of the passengers and crew involved, especially the 8 families who lost loved ones in the wreck. To the rescue personnel who responded to the call, we all extend our gratitude. On Wednesday evening after votes, I took Amtrak back up to Philadelphia where I visited the crash site with Philadelphia Mayor Michael Nutter and House Railroads Subcommittee Chairman Jeff Denham and Ranking Member Michael Capuano. While there, we talked with National Transportation Safety Board Official Robert Sumwalt about the latest update in the NTSB investigation. As like many of you, I remain very attentive to news alerts concerning the investigation. The House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee will be holding a hearing after Memorial Day, and I anticipate communicating with you in the weeks to come on this. As Chairman Shuster noted in announcing this hearing, ""the results of this investigation will be critical to understanding all the circumstances involved in this tragic incident. It's also important for Congress to assess and understand the related safety and infrastructure policies currently in place in order to determine what next steps may be necessary."" Passenger rail is an integral part of the life and economy of Southeastern Pennsylvania and all along the Northeast Corridor (NEC). A safe, reliable passenger rail system is critical to our region's economy. I am also committee to working with my colleagues to provide Amtrak with the resources needed to maintain and improve rail along the NEC. I joined Luke Russert on Friday to further discuss the tragedy. You can view that clip here  . Congressional Art Competition On Monday, I announced that Conestoga High School Senior Tim Herons artwork was awarded the grand prize at the annual Congressional Art Competition. Tims graphite pencil creation entitled Doomed Engagements will be on display in the halls of the U.S. Capitol for the next year. Almost 40 high school students from across Pennsylvanias Sixth Congressional District participated and submitted pieces of artwork. The art was judged by an independent four person panel, and all students are to be commended for their hard work. I also want to acknowledge art teachers from across the district for their encouragement and guidance to all the students. Thank you to the Reading Eagle for joining us at the awards reception  . Congressional Art Competition winners included  Grand prize: Tim Heron, senior at Conestoga High School, teacher: Leanne Argonish, ""Doomed Engagements"", graphite pencil, will be displayed in the halls of the Capitol  First prize: Mike Delice, senior at Exeter Township High School, teacher: Christina Pinkerton, ""Springtime Walkway"", watercolor, will be displayed in the Washington, D.C. Office  Second prize winner: Madison Kochel, senior at Exeter Township High School, teacher: Christina Pinkerton, ""Blue Monarchs"", colored pencil, will be displayed in the Wyomissing Office  Third prize winner: Taylor Melchior, Junior at Phoenixville Area High School, teacher: Kelin Spina, ""Deep Groove"", photography, will be displayed in the West Chester Office Next week, I will be back on Capitol Hill where the House will consider the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act in addition to legislation that will encourage the growth of a 21st century economy. I will provide an additional legislative recap from this week in the coming days. Sincerely,  Ryan Costello Member of Congress    Enjoyed meeting students from Exeter High School at the Congressional Art Competition reception.

,114,Male,N00035346,43683,"Carter, Buddy (Rep.) [R-GA1]","Landmark Pro-Life Legislation I am excited to report that the House passed landmark pro-life legislation this week to extend protections for the unborn. I supported H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, to ban abortions nationwide 20 weeks after conception except in the cases of incest and rape. The legislation is supported by nearly every pro-life organization including the Georgia Life Alliance, the National Right to Life Committee, Concerned Women for America, Family Research Council, Americans United for Life, Christian Coalition, Susan B. Anthony List, National Committee for a Human Life Amendment, and March for Life. As a healthcare professional, father, grandfather and Congressman, I strongly believe life starts at conception. There is overwhelming scientific evidence proving that precious babies are capable of feeling pain after 20 weeks and this legislation would put a necessary end to the excruciating abortion methods used in late term pregnancies. While this legislation is a strong win for the pro-life cause, it's time for the United States Congress to stand up for all those who cannot stand up for themselves and pass permanent federal legislation that will protect innocent lives at any stage of gestation. I have cosponsored H.R. 426, the Sanctity of Human Life Act, which protects human life from conception. I will continue to be an advocate for those who cannot protect themselves. Congressional Oversight of the Dangerous Iran Nuclear Deal This week, the House passed H.R. 1191, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act, to prevent the president from unilaterally lifting sanctions in Iran if Congress does not approve the final nuclear deal currently being negotiated. There is no question that Congress should have oversight and scrutiny over any nuclear deal with Iran. Our president is negotiating this deal and ignoring the reality that Iran has a long-term plan to increase its nuclear capabilities while threatening Israel, one of our closest allies, and the security of the entire world. These negotiations are a ploy to trick the United States and our allies into allowing full freedom for Iran to grow their nuclear presence, implement their plans of terror and provoke a nuclear arms race in the most unstable region. Allowing Congressional oversight is the only way the American people, through their elected representatives, will have the opportunity to voice their concerns. The president must work with Congress to ensure the Iranian regime is held accountable and the threat of their nuclear program is eliminated. Reducing the FOIA Backlog at DHS The Committee on Homeland Securitys Subcommittee on Oversight and Management Efficiency approved my legislation this week to require the Chief FOIA Officer at the Department of Homeland Security to improve and streamline the FOIA request process at the department to reduce their backlog and provide greater transparency on costs associated with the FOIA process. I introduced my legislation, the DHS FOIA Efficiency Act of 2015, after a Government Accountability Office (GAO) report found that DHS has an outstanding number of backlogged FOIA requests due to mismanagement and duplicative efforts between components of the department. At the end of fiscal year 2013, DHS held approximately half of the reported backlogged federal FOIA requests, more than any other federal agency. In what is supposed to be the most transparent administration in history, DHS has an abysmal record when it comes to FOIA requests. It boasts the largest backlog of any federal agency and was given a D+ for its handling of them by an independent watchdog. I am pleased the subcommittee approved this important legislation moving these desperately needed reforms to improve the process, eliminate duplication and significantly reduce the backlog while increasing transparency and accountability to the public one step closer to reality. From our Nation's Capitol XIX Monday, May 11, 2015: I had a great time this past weekend at the Brunswick Blessing of the Fleet Festival. This is a wonderful celebration of cultural heritage and I was honored to give the opening remarks. The celebration honors Our Lady of Fatima, the patron saint of Portugal, as well as the mothers of the St. Francis Xavier Parish. Although we do not have votes until tomorrow, I decided to come up today in order to squeeze in some meetings and get ahead on some of my work. My first meeting of the day is with the Congressional Research Service (CRS), to discuss pending issues. The CRS is a non-partisan service available to members and committees of Congress to provide policy and legal analysis and have been a great resource to me as a freshman. Afterwards, we have our weekly staff meeting to review the previous week and discuss the upcoming week. I am blessed to have an outstanding staff that I have come to depend on as well as trust. Later, I welcome the Georgia Association of Medical Equipment Suppliers (GAMES) to their meeting in Savannah via skype before meeting with Georgia Right to Life regarding upcoming abortion legislation. My final meeting of the day is with the American Chamber of Commerce in Egypt to discuss our mutual commitment of fighting extremist violence in the world through economic cooperation. Tuesday, May 12, 2015: My day begins with a meeting with the American Pharmacists Association to discuss pending issues, followed by taping public service announcements on literacy and support for returning troops. Back in the office, I receive the news that my friend, Denise Sears Moody from Nahunta, has died at the age of 53 from a heart attack. I am literally stopped in my tracks. Denise died Sunday after spending the day with her mother and family. She sat down in a recliner in her home and never got up. Denise was the Administrator at Bayview Nursing Home when I was the Consultant Pharmacist there for many years. She and her family owned a number of nursing homes in South Georgia and allowed my company to service those homes. They played a big part in my businesses success. Denise and her family supported me in my run for Congress and her son Zane is set to be an intern in our DC office this summer. My heart is broken and, after speaking with her mother and Zane, I regain my composure as I know Denise would want me to and continue on with my day. Next, I meet with Ralph and Danielle Drollinger, a wonderful couple who coordinate the members bible study group at the Capitol. Later, I travel downtown to give the keynote address to the National Community Pharmacists Association during their annual meeting before heading back to the office to meet with Eli Gold of the London Center for Policy Research. The goal of this group is to look ahead and forecast future threats across the globe and their impact to the U.S. Later, I meet with Lisa Wilson from Savannah and other members of the American Heart Association who are up here lobbying for an increase in NIH heart and stroke research funding. After meeting with Michael Botticelli, the National Director of Drug Control Policy, about the growing problem of heroin abuse, I head to the weekly Whip team meeting where we review the upcoming weeks schedule and issues. My day ends with a vote series on procedural resolutions. Wednesday, May 13, 2015: I am honored today to welcome Savannah Mayor Edna Jackson to our Washington office. Mayor Jackson, who serves on a number of national boards, is in town today attending a meeting of the National League of Cities, which advocates for our countrys cities. Following our weekly Republican Conference meeting, I head to a Subcommittee on Oversight and Management Efficiency meeting where I am presenting my first bill that I have introduced as a member of Congress. H.R. 1615, known as the DHS FOIA Efficiency Act of 2015, seeks to improve the issue of backlogged Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) requests at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS). The number of FOIA requests at DHS has increased over 65% in the last few years and DHS now has over 50% of all of the pending FOIA requests in the entire government. The bill passes the subcommittee unanimously and next will be heard before the full committee. Afterwards, I head back to the office to meet with Maggie Gill and Becky Keightley from Memorial Health University in Savannah to discuss health and hospital issues of the day. Next, I attend the weekly meeting of the Republican Study Committee, a group of conservative members of the Republican Party who advocate for a conservative agenda within the party. My next meeting is outside the Capitol at the Department of Transportation (DOT) where I meet with DOT staff and officials from the Georgia Ports Authority (GPA), including Jamie McCurry, to discuss a grant application submitted by the GPA. Once back at the Capitol, I meet with a large group of realtors from our district, who are in town to advocate for real estate related issues. This group includes many of my good friends who I have worked closely with over the years while serving as Mayor of Pooler and in the State Legislature. I am particularly glad to see my former Administrative Assistant in the Georgia State Senate, Abigail Thompson, visiting with the group. Abigail now works representing the Realtors and is doing an outstanding job. Next I head to the House Chamber for votes before heading to a reception in honor of my colleague from South Carolina, Representative Trey Gowdy. Thursday, May 14, 2015: I am happy to welcome students from the South Effingham Middle School, including Madelyn Smith, my sisters niece, to the Capitol today and meet them on the Plaza steps for a picture. The weather in DC has been phenomenal this week, with highs in the 70s and lows in the 50s, and it is nice to be able to get outside for a change. My first meeting of the day is with the Education and Workforce committee where we are having hearings on the conditions of our Native American Schools. Next, I head back to the office where I meet with the Southern Crop Production Association about the Clean Water Act and other issues affecting farmers in our district. Following a hearing with the Committee on Oversight and Government Reform and regarding recent lapses within the Secret Service, I head to the House chamber for a long series of votes. My final meeting of the day is with the RSC Health Policy Working Committee where we finalize our proposed legislation to replace Obamacare. Friday, May 15, 2015: I only have time for one meeting this morning- a briefing for members of the Education and Workforce committee to bring us up to date on King v. Burwell- before heading to the House Chamber to vote on a number of amendments and final passage of the National Defense Spending Bill. After passing this important piece of legislation, I rush to the airport to head home. Following a much needed haircut, I attend Bethesdas Scholarship Gala where we honor the graduating class of 2015 of this fine institution that is celebrating its 275th anniversary this year and hear from University of Georgia coaching legend Vince Dooley.

,114,Male,N00033518,43615,"Collins, Doug (Rep.) [R-GA9]","Congressman Doug Collins Dear Lindsey,  My father was a Georgia State Trooper. He instilled in me respect for the law. Last week, during National Police Week, the entire country got a chance to celebrate the men and women who make it their jobs. In Washington, I said thank you, personally, to two outstanding Northeast Georgia sheriffs -- Jackson County Sheriff Janis Mangum [link 1] and Stephens County Sheriff Randy Shirley [link 2].  On Capitol Hill, we participated in a Google video hangout [link 3] with Rep. Dave Reichert, a sheriff himself from Washington State [link 4], as well as police officers from around the country. We talked about some unfortunate episodes of antagonism towards law enforcement and how Congress could help support officers. Just this week, House Republicans passed a national ""Blue Alert"" system to more quickly identify perpetrators of anti-police violence.  Also recently, I introduced two of my own bills. The Federal Law Enforcement Officers Self-Defense and Protection Act would allow federal officers to continue to carry their firearms in the event of a lapse in government funding. The Comprehensive Justice and Mental Health Act would provide more mental health training to local officers to help protect them from harm. It would create special veterans courts and other programs to divert returning soldiers from county jails into treatment for combat-related stress disorders.  Please read more about my mental health bill -- just one of the ways I'm working in Congress to support police -- in Red Alert Politics [link 6]. In addition, I regularly meet with Ninth District sheriffs to learn about their needs. Already this year, I've met with most Northeast Georgia sheriffs.

,114,Male,N00030829,43680,"Buck, Ken (Rep.) [R-CO4]","  Home  About Ken  About Our District  News  Contact  Weekly Newsletter Dear Friend, I just introduced my first bill  to amend  the Antiquities Act of 1906. The Antiquities Act grants the President unilateral authority to designate national monuments. As I explained in the Gazette  , the law once served a valuable purpose when it was originally enacted. It was necessary for Congress to yield power to the president so that he could quickly protect federal interests, and to prevent the looting and and destruction of natural and man-made treasures in the western part of the United States. Thanks to the Antiquities Act, President Theodore Roosevelt preserved some of America's greatest treasures: Devil's Tower in Wyoming; El Morro in New Mexico; Muir Woods in California; the Petrified Forest and Grand Canyon in Arizona. The intent of the law is important. But times have changed. Western states are now populated by private citizens who elect their own local and state governments. Like many outdated laws, the Antiquities Act is now used in harmful ways. If my bill becomes law, presidential declaration of a national monument will be a temporary measure. For a new national monument to achieve permanent status, each designation must be approved by Congress and by the legislatures of the states affected by the declaration. This week, the House of Representatives approved the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act (H.R. 36) by a vote of 242-184  , which would ban abortions, with limited exceptions, in the United States after 20 weeks post fertilization. We are one of only seven nations in the world  on a list that includes known human rights abusers China, North Korea, and Singapore  that still allows late term abortions. These innocent unborn babies deserve our protection. We also passed the USA Freedom Act of 2015 (H.R. 2048  ), which reforms our nations intelligence-gathering programs operated under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA). The USA Freedom Act is a positive step toward protecting Americans right to privacy while simultaneously ensuring their safety. The Act secures important reforms that end bulk data collection, strengthen protection of civil liberties, and prevent government overreach. This bill was the result of a careful compromise between the House Judiciary Committee and the House Intelligence Committee. I appreciate the efforts that went into crafting this compromise. It is because we must act quickly to reform the carte blanche collection of information that we did not adopt amendments that might have improved the bill further.

Passed shortly after the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Patriot Act, specifically Section 215, granted federal agencies, including the National Security Agency, increased surveillance powers to prevent additional terrorist attacks. Some Americans have concerns that the Act does not sufficiently protect our privacy, while others argue that surveillance is necessary in order for the government to effectively investigate terrorist threats. Legislation introduced in both the House and the Senate, entitled the USA Freedom Act [link 1], would reauthorize Section 215 until December 31st, 2020, with one key reform: the bill would prohibit the indiscriminate bulk collection of metadata from domestic phone companies, while maintaining the ability to conduct surveillance beyond our borders.

[R-NY22]","HOUSE PASSES DEFENSE BILL The House of Representatives on Friday passed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, which determined there will be no military base realignments or closures in 2016 and it includes a number of provisions to assist Upstates service members and veterans. The Base Realignment and Closure process, commonly referred to as ""BRAC,"" closes excess military installations. This bill prohibits a BRAC round from being authorized or carried out in 2016. This is especially important for facilities located at the former Griffiss Air Force Base  Rome Lab, the Eastern Air Defense Sector, and the Rome Defense Finance and Accounting Service (DFAS) site. To support the Southern Tier economy, this bill also invests in the multiservice F-35 Joint Strike Fighter, components of which are produced in Owego. Congressman Richard Hanna voted in favor of the NDAA, an annual bill which is necessary to perform some of the most basic and essential responsibilities of Congress  such as funding our Armed Forces and national defenses and paying the salaries of our servicemen and women. This important legislation is a critical measure that will bring security to our Mohawk Valley defense installations, sustain jobs in the Southern Tier, and provide continued support for our service members and their families, Congressman Hanna said. It means no BRAC in 2016 and provides our armed services with the resources they need to respond to a diverse range of national security threats. The NDAA also gives our troops a well-deserved raise and rejects burdensome fee increases to TRICARE for current and former service members. I am especially pleased to have been able to include amendments that will help Upstate small businesses to grow and compete, recognize the valuable contributions of New Yorks Guard and Reserve personnel, and highlight the cutting edge capabilities of Rome Lab.

Miss Wood was in Washington during National Women's Health Week to participate in a conference sponsored by CARE USA. CARE was founded in 1945, when 22 American organizations came together to rush lifesaving CARE Packages to survivors of World War II. Thousands of Americans, including President Harry S. Truman, contributed to the effort. On May 11, 1946, the first 20,000 packages reached the battered port of Le Havre, France. These early packages were U.S. Army surplus ""10-in-1"" food parcels intended to provide one meal for 10 soldiers during the planned invasion of Japan. We obtained them at the end of the war and began a service that let Americans send the packages to friends and families in Europe, where millions were in danger of starvation. Ten dollars bought a CARE Package and guaranteed that its addressee would receive it within four months. Today, CARE works in 90 countries around the world to support more than 900 poverty-fighting development and humanitarian-aid projects. Congressman Hanna and Miss Wood spoke about the International Violence Against Women Act, global food security and child health, among other topics. MOTORCYCLE GROUP HONORS HANNA Congressman Richard Hanna was recently honored by the American Motorcyclist Association with its Supporter Award for his support of motorcyclists' rights and issues of importance to motorcycling. Founded in 1924, the AMA is a nonprofit member-based association whose mission is to promote the motorcycle lifestyle and protect the future of motorcycling. As the world's largest motorcycling rights and event sanctioning organization, the AMA advocates for riders' interests at all levels of government and sanctions thousands of competition and recreational events every year. ""Congressman Hanna has demonstrated an interest in and support for the issues that most directly affect the motorcycling community, and we take great pleasure in honoring him for his efforts,"" said Wayne Allard, AMA vice president for government relations and a former U.S. Senator and U.S. Representative from Colorado.

But often times, our southern border is used as boogeymen of sorts, evoking fear that is used for political purposes. This week in the House of Representatives, an amendment was introduced that played on those fears. The measure proposed to expand a controversial program that provides civilian law enforcement with excess military equipment. The amendments expansion would authorize border patrol agents on Americas northern and southern borders to receive military-grade weapons and vehicles, as well. Treating our borders and the communities there like war zones in this way is unnecessary and poses potential risks.

We had some really amazing pieces in the competition this year  thanks to all the students who participated! * National Police Week * Protecting the Joint Base * Reining in the EPA * Around the District National Police Week This week was National Police Week, and several of our local police officers marked the occasion by participating in the Police Unity Tour, where they biked from New Jersey all the way to the Law Enforcement Memorial in Washington. I'm so impressed by the dedication of these officers and grateful for the service of all our law enforcement officers. Take some time to thank the police men and women in your neighborhood! Protecting the Joint Base On the floor this week, we had a long discussion about this year's defense spending bill. I even took to the floor to share my thoughts on why the bill was important, which you can watch in the video below. Like I said in my remarks, this defense bill would prevent another round of base closures from happening next year. The Administration has already signaled that they'll do anything possible to close military installations like Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst  and we can't let that happen. I'll continue to stand against these closures and protect the 100,000 local jobs supported by the Joint Base.  Reining in the EPA It's no secret that the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) is a fan of regulations. While they do good work ensuring that we have clean water and air, sometimes their rules and requirements can be ridiculous. For example, their Waters of the US Rule wants to expand the EPA's regulatory overreach to cover things like ditches, drainages, and small ponds. Complying with regulations on how to manage this water would be excessively expensive for our small farmers, and could cripple the agricultural industry. Fortunately, the House told the EPA this week that they couldn't move forward with this unnecessary new rule. You can read more by clicking here  .

Capitol Hill was abuzz with activity last week so there's a lot I'd like to tell you about. On the House Floor The House of Representatives approved several major bills last week of interest to farmers, pro-life advocates, privacy hawks and every American who supports a strong national defense. The first was H.R. 1732  , a bill that could finally end the uncertainty and anxiety over the EPA and Army Corp of Engineers proposed Waters of the U.S. rule. The legislation would require the two agencies to withdraw their controversial proposal. It then instructs them to work with state and local stakeholders to develop a new rule that considers the public comments they've already received, as well as the economic and scientific analysis of the first proposed rule. The debate over Waters of the U.S. has been a source of great concern for farmers and property owners in my district, and I'm glad this legislation creates an opportunity to better define the scope of federal jurisdiction under the Clean Water Act. The second was H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act  This legislation would ban late-term abortions with exceptions for rape, incest and to protect the life of the mother. The U.S. is one of only seven countries that allow elective abortions after 20 weeks. That's not only immoral, but science now tells us that such late term abortions are painful to babies who are increasingly able to survive premature birth. More information on the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act is available HERE  . The remainder of the week was focused on national defense. The House passed the USA Freedom Act  to end bulk data collection by our intelligence agencies like the NSA and the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act  to require Congressional review of any final nuclear agreement with Iran before the President can waive or suspend sanctions previously imposed by Congress. We also approved the annual National Defense Authorization Act  (NDAA). That legislation sets policies and funding levels for the military and overseas operations. In the Energy & Commerce Committee I also spent a lot of time in the Energy and Commerce Committee last week where my subcommittee unanimously approved bipartisan legislation  to modernize the way chemicals in commerce are reviewed and approved for use. The law currently regulating chemical safety, the Toxic Substance Control Act, has not been updated since the 1970s. While we still have a long way to go before this reform makes it to the President's desk, I'm more hopeful than ever that Congress can produce a good bill that's a win-win for consumers and manufacturers. Another subcommittee also held a hearing last week on the subject of Internet Governance  . Last year the Obama Administration announced their intention to surrender longstanding U.S. oversight of key Internet functions to a so-called 'global multistakeholder community'. Concerns over what effect this transition would have on the free and open Internet were immediately raised by conservatives and liberals alike, and I quickly introduced legislation to ensure Congress has a say  before any irreversible decision is made. Finally, my subcommittee held a hearing to review our nation's nuclear waste management policy  . You can read about how this issue is important to Illinois, and the country as a whole, in last week's newsletter  . Thanks for reading and have a great week!

senior,"114,115,116",Male,N00004981,300038,"Durbin, Richard (Sen.) [D-IL]","Fellow Illinoisans: At the end of this month, the federal program that pays for our countrys major transportation and infrastructure needs expires. That is just days away. Without Congressional action, funding to states and mass transit agencies across the country will stop. This could seriously jeopardize projects in Illinois and across the country. We have been in this situation before and managed to authorize an extension without a lapse. But we shouldnt have to run the federal highway and transit program like this. The longer we wait to address the issue, the more the cost to repair and replace goes up. And thats just maintaining what we have, not investing in what we need. Illinois Impact Illinois receives roughly $2 billion in annual transportation funds from the federal government of which nearly $600 million is for transit. Millions of people in Illinois and across the country count on these trains and buses to get to work; to visit family; to run to the grocery store. This morning alone, 1.5 million Chicagoans took a trip on a Chicago Transit Authority bus or train during rush hour. And its not just in Chicago, transit ridership is at an all-time high across our state, but without a long-term federal investment plan, capacity on cant even begin to keep up with demand. When it comes our roads, highways and bridges, Illinois is in even worse shape. Small businesses make up many of the companies involved in repairing the more than 4,000 bridges that have been deemed structurally deficient or functionally obsolete and restoring the roads in poor condition that have cost Illinoisans$3.7 billion a year in vehicle maintenance each year  thats $448 per driver! Click here for an interactive map on Americas infrastructure backlog. Slowing payments to these contractors and construction workers who are currently fixing these problems is senseless. This hurts jobs, both direct and indirect. Design, construction and maintenance of transportation infrastructure supports 138,701 full-time jobs in Illinois. These workers out on the roads and bridges are middle-class men and women working labor-intensive jobs to feed their families and put their kids through school. They dont deserve this uncertainty -- not knowing whether or not they will be paid on time. And they do not need another manufactured crisis to disrupt their lives. Long-Term Investment Solution Now the question is not if we should keep kicking the can down the road, but how far we kick it. A month? Till September? Till the end of the year? The President has proposed a six-year, $478 billion bill that improves our roads, public transportation systems and freight and passenger rail networks. Under this plan, Illinois would receive an additional $575 million annually to invest in repairing and modernizing our infrastructure. Click here to read more about President Obamas plan. We cant patch our way to prosperity. We need a long-term transportation bill that creates good-paying jobs by building newer, better infrastructure that will lay the foundation for a strong economy.

[R-IA3]","News from Iowa Congressman David Young  Home  About Me  Media Center  Services  Contact  Friends, As you know, every other week I send out a short, one question survey, so I can get your quick thoughts on a topic. Feel free to forward this on to your family, friends, neighbors, and coworkers so they can share their thoughts too. This week's 60 Second Survey topic is: a proposed a rule that redefines how water is classified by the federal government. When Congress passed the Clean Waters Act (CWA) in 1972, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers (the Corps) were tasked with overseeing the ""Waters of the United States,"" (WOTUS) and state and local government were tasked with oversight of smaller, remote waters - like lakes, ponds and isolated wetlands. On March 25, 2014, the EPA and the Corps proposed to change the scope and reach of their jurisdiction with the new WOTUS rule. Under this rule, ponds, ditches, or runoff from a farm, or your front yard, could be considered ""waters of the United States"" and therefore fall under the control and jurisdiction of the federal government. This, under any observation, is a massive expansion of the federal governments jurisdiction into traditionally state and local controlled property. I am strongly against this proposed rule, which is why I supported H.R. 1732: Regulatory Integrity Protection Act  . This ""reset bill"" would roll back the proposed Waters of the U.S. rule and require the EPA and Corps to consult with stakeholders in this process. The Environmental Protection Agency and U.S. Army Corps of Engineers proposed a rule that redefines how they classify and control waters of the U.S. Do you agree with or oppose this proposed rule?

Energy News Olson Ensuring Grid Reliability H.R. 1558 - Resolving Environmental and Grid Reliability Conflicts Act This week, the House Energy and Commerce Committee released a large energy package of bills for discussion - included is my grid reliability bill, H.R. 1558, the Resolving Environmental and Grid Reliability Conflicts Act. Section one of the legislation seeks to update our nations energy infrastructure and ensure it is secure, resilient, and reliable. Changing market dynamics, new regulations, and increasing threats have created new energy security and reliability challenges, particularly for the nations electricity sector. Inclusion of my grid reliability bill means we can fix an unfortunate glitch in federal law that puts power generators in the unenviable position of choosing which federal law they will violate.

I am interested to learn your opinion on the estate tax, and would appreciate your responses below: Do you agree with the concept of an estate tax that claims some percentage of the estate of a deceased person for the government? No, this is an unfair practice. This money has already been taxed, and should not be taxed again when it is being passed to the next generation, regardless of the size of a farm or business. No, this is an unfair practice, but it should only be repealed if we can find a replacement source of revenue for the federal government. Yes, the federal government needs the revenue, and those Americans with large assets should pay more. Not sure or other. Do you believe that our current estate tax rate is appropriate (40% tax rate on estates over $5.34 million for an individual)? No, I do not agree with the concept of a death tax. No, I believe that the rate should be higher, or the amount of assets which can be passed on tax-free should be lower. (pay more in taxes) No, I believe that the rate should be lower, or the amount of assets which can be passed on tax-free should be higher. (pay less in taxes) Yes, I believe the current level of taxation is appropriate. Not sure or other. Do you have any additional thoughts to share?

[R-TX19]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email  News from Representative Randy Neugebauer   May 11, 2015 Keeping America Safe Earlier this month, radical Islamic terrorists carried out a failed attack on Texas soil in Garland. The Texas attack comes at a time when the Middle East continues to unravel and ISIS remains on the march. In this time of rising threats-it is clear to me that we must defeat and destroy ISIS-and use all the tools available to keep our communities safe. This week, the House of Representatives is expected to vote on two bills concerning our national security; the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for fiscal year 2016, and the USA FREEDOM Act. The NDAA authorizes funding for the Department of Defense and provides the resources needed for our military to carry out its mission. The USA FREEDOM Act modifies the surveillance techniques of our security agencies, while reauthorizing key provisions of the Patriot Act to gather intelligence on suspected terrorists and prevent future attacks. As the debate in Congress continues, I am focused on providing for a strong national defense that can defeat the terrorist threat while appropriately balancing our civil liberties. Protecting the Unborn I strongly believe in the sanctity of life and protecting the rights of the unborn. This week, the House is expected to vote on H.R 36-the Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act. I proudly cosponsored this important pro-life measure that prevents late-term abortions after 20 weeks-the time when an unborn child can feel pain. This will save thousands of lives and end this outrageous attack on unborn children. As a member of the Bipartisan Congressional Pro-Life Caucus, I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress to protect and defend these unborn babies. The Importance of Prayer Last Thursday was the 64th National Day of Prayer. To mark this important day, I joined over 50 of my colleagues in writing a letter led by the Congressional Prayer Caucus-of which I am a cofounder- outlining the importance of prayer in our nation's history. We write, ""We need to recognize the uniting power of prayer. That is why, as co-chairmen of the Congressional Prayer Caucus, we introduced a bipartisan resolution, H.Res. 547, supporting the National Day of Prayer and urging all Americans to come together to pray and to reaffirm the importance prayer has had in our nation's history. By recalling historic national calls to prayer from Presidents Washington, Lincoln, Franklin D. Roosevelt, Eisenhower, Kennedy, Clinton, and George W. Bush, this resolution serves as a reminder of the many ways that prayer has united and strengthened the American people."" National Review featured the full letter here  . 45th Anniversary of the Lubbock Tornado As many of you may remember, on this day 45 years ago, a powerful tornado ripped through Lubbock killing 26, injuring hundreds, and leaving $1.5 billion in property damage. I was in Lubbock that day and I will never forget the devastation and destruction it inflicted on our community. Research institutions like the National Wind Institute at Texas Tech University, whose origins came about in the wake of this tornado, have better increased our understanding of the effects of windstorms on structures and how we can better mitigate these damages. In 2004, I first introduced the National Windstorm Impact Reduction Program (NWIRP) to promote research and minimize the devastating effects caused by windstorms. We have found that $1 in investments in resilience against windstorms can result in up to $4 dollars in savings in disaster response, but more importantly can reduce the loss of life associated with these storms. And earlier this year the House overwhelmingly passed my bill to reauthorize NWIRP. This is a common sense bill that I'm hopeful the Senate will soon consider and move forward into law.

May 6, 2015.)  Sen. Rob Portman discusses meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu After traveling to Israel over the weekend to meet with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, Ohio GOP Sen. Rob Portman relayed Netanyahu's concerns about a pending treaty that's intended to lift economic sanctions against Iran and also keep it from developing nuclear weapons. ""He's worried,"" Portman told FoxNews' Greta Van Susteren. ""He's concerned about what's happening in the neighborhood. It's a pretty dangerous and volatile place."" Portman told Van Susteren that Netanyahu doesn't want sanctions lifted against Iran or for the country to become a ""threshold nuclear power"" when Iran is the ""number one state sponsor of terrorism in the world."" ""It's really important that we have a constant dialogue with them and we stand with them,"" said Portman. ""Israel is the one democracy in the region. They're our true friend. If we're not standing with them, the place will be even more volatile, the Middle East and the region."" (""Sen.

Portman is visiting and reassuring Israel Ohio's Republican U.S. Sen. Rob Portman is in Israel and met with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, and intelligence and other Israeli officials. Portman told the Jerusalem Post he thinks Congress can pass a law that would give it oversight of a prospective nuclear deal between the U.S. and Iran. He acknowledged however that three amendments to the bill have made that tougher, including one that would insist that Iran recognize Israel's right to exist. (""Ohio GOP Sen.

U.S. must do more to help Ukraine withstand Russian aggression As multiple global crises compete for our attention, we must not neglect the situation in Ukraine and the need to stand with an ally who needs our help. I recently returned from a fact-finding trip to Ukraine, a year after my colleague Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland and I led a congressional delegation to monitor last year's presidential election. Ukrainians made an unequivocal choice to pursue a pro-Western, democratic path, and are making progress in fighting decades of endemic corruption that left Ukraine weak, while simultaneously dealing with a blatant Russian invasion. Successful follow-through on these reforms will be absolutely essential to the long-term success and prosperity of Ukraine. However, none of these efforts will mean much if Ukraine is unable to secure its borders or defend its sovereignty.Every day, Ukrainian positions come under attack, and Russian tanks, supplies, and soldiers continue to cross the border. Many of these attacks involve the use of heavy artillery systems that the separatists were supposed to have withdrawn under the terms of the cease-fire. The United States and our NATO allies must do more to help strengthen Ukrainian military capabilities. In the short-term, Ukraine needs critical defensive capabilities such as anti-tank weapons, secure communications, short- and long-range counterbattery radars, night vision and thermal optics, unmanned aerial vehicles, and air defense systems. Equally important is effective monitoring of U.S. assistance - from both the American and Ukrainian sides - to ensure it reaches the front-line troops who need it most. The administration seems to believe that the requested U.S. support for Ukraine will somehow lead to more instability. I believe that further inaction will only expand the current conflict. At no point in this conflict has Russian President Vladimir Putin's decision to escalate been costly enough to force him to fundamentally reconsider his strategy. Russia's annexation of Crimea, campaign to destabilize and then invade eastern Ukraine last summer and fall, and recent winter offensive all happened despite Western attempts to force a negotiated settlement. Efforts to strengthen Ukraine must be part of a broader, comprehensive strategy to support our regional allies and deter Russian aggression. We must demonstrate America's commitment to the security of our NATO allies through a reinforced NATO presence in Eastern Europe and more vigorous American engagement in training and security cooperation. Most importantly, we must be very clear about the stakes in this conflict. President Putin's actions upend decades of established international norms, and the response demonstrates the weakness of the Western alliance and America's leadership. Confidence in America and our European allies' unity and commitment to uphold these norms deters bad actors and incentivizes other countries to play by the rules, which helps ensure peace, stability, and prosperity. If the credibility of this commitment is in doubt, then the chance for violence, instability, and economic collapse increases. Nearly every Ukrainian official I met with understood this. It's time the White House did as well. (""U.S. must do more to help Ukraine withstand Russian aggression,"" Senator Rob Portman. Cleveland Plain Dealer  . May 4, 2015.)

The Senate bill would require a competed deal to be submitted to Congress, which could then vote to approve or disapprove the nuclear deal within 30 days. Sanctions on Iran could not be lifted during this consideration. The legislation empowers Congress with an up-or-down vote on any deal the administration reaches. Now the House is set to possibly take this bill up this week, and there is much debate about the Senate bill. Democrats in the House have circulated a letter indicating they would block any effort by Republicans to reject Obamas final deal with Iran; which would effectively derail any Congressional disapproval of Obamas final deal, should Congress vote that way. House Republicans argue the goal is to give Congress, and the American people, a say in any final deal. The goal, if Congress votes against the final deal, is to stop a bad agreement that could pave the way to a nuclear-armed Iran, set off a regional nuclear arms race, and strengthen and legitimize the government of Iran. Question of the Week: Should the American people, through their elected representatives in Congress, have a say on any final deal regarding the future of Irans nuclear program? Yes, the people should have a say; I support the bill. No, the president should have autonomy in this case; I do not support the bill. I am unsure.

Sign up  Friends, I hope you had a wonderful Mother's Day this weekend and were able to spend time with your loved ones. This was a very special Mother's Day for me as it was actually the first one I've spent home with my family in five years. The previous four, I have led or been a part of Congressional Delegations to Afghanistan  , where we would visit with troops, including many military moms.   [My daughter Margaret at a recent check-up at Children's Hospital.] This Mother's Day I was so touched by a special piece by House Speaker John Boehner  . It tells the story of how, while in Baghdad on a Congressional Delegation to the Middle East  , my daughter Margaret, back home in Alabama, fell and broke her arm. Any of you who are moms or dads know how difficult it was for me to be half a world away and unable to be with her. But that was only the tiniest glimpse into what so many of our military families go though every day for months and years. I am forever grateful  for the sacrifices our service members voluntarily make in defense of this country. Days like Mother's Day can be especially tough for military families who are separated during a tour of duty. Let's remember them and keep them in our prayers, not only on holidays, but every day. Around the District I recently took advantage of a brief break in Congressional action and made my way around Alabama's 2nd Congressional District visiting with constituents and meeting with groups. It's always good to be out and about hearing directly from those I represent about their views and concerns. Here are a few highlights from the road: Dothan: Career and Technical Education  has been a primary focus of mine while in Congress, and I've had the chance to visit several programs recently. From Dothan Technology Center on the campus of Northview High School to Wallace Community College, Dothan has a strong network of CTE programs serving local students. I enjoyed the tour and a discussion later with Dr. Philip Cleveland  , Director of Career and Technical Education for the Alabama Department of Education about the progress they are making statewide.  [I'm thankful for Dr. Philip Cleveland's leadership and strong support of Alabama's Career and Technical Education Programs.] But Dothan's education system has another achievement to celebrate: three local schools were recently named National Blue Ribbon Schools: Beverlye Magnet School, Heard Magnet School and Montana Street Magnet School. I was proud to celebrate this honor with the teachers and principals at the Dothan Education Foundation's celebratory luncheon. Thanks to the hard work of our educators and community partnerships, it's clear there is a bright future at Dothan City Schools. Pike County and Evergreen: I always enjoy speaking at civic club lunches  throughout the district, and recently I was able to visit with those in Evergreen  and Brundidge. Most times it's more of a visit than a speech because we spend time talking as a group about the issues of the day. I heard a lot of concerns about the tension in the Middle East and the President's negotiations with Iran. I also heard a lot about how federal regulations and red tape continue to choke small businesses. Thank you all to all those who came out and said hello.  [At a recent meeting with the Brundidge Rotary Club. Thanks for visiting with me! ] While in Troy, I also went by Pike County Liberal Arts School  to visit with the senior government class. I always enjoy talking about issues with young men and women who are not only studying history and government, but also getting ready to become a participant in our democratic process. I can tell you that the students at Pike Lib are well-informed in that regard. Judging from the questions and conversation, I know they have some bright futures ahead. Thanks to Headmaster Becky Bagett and Assistant Headmaster Amy Garrett for having me on campus! The Week Ahead I'm back in D.C. this week to work through a number of legislative issues. Here's a look at bills scheduled to come before the House of Representatives this week: * H.R. 1732  - Regulatory Integrity Protection Act of 2015 * H.R. 1735  - National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016 * H.R. 36  - Pain Capable Unborn Child Protection Act * Possible Consideration of H.R. 2048  - USA FREEDOM Act of 2015 * Possible Consideration of H.R. 1191  - A bill to provide for Congressional review and oversight of agreements relating to Iran's nuclear program Stay in Touch You can keep up with the latest news by finding me on Facebook and Twitter where I post updates daily.

,114,Male,N00007727,43273,"Blumenauer, Earl (Rep.) [D-OR3]","Dear Friends, During President Obamas visit to Portland, he highlighted why reducing barriers to trade done right is critical to Oregon. With an economy thats growing in fits and starts, its often easy to forget Oregon is a trade powerhouse. In fact, Oregon has a trade surplus in both goods and services  even with China. In 2014 alone, we exported over $20 billion in goods, making Portland the 4th largest exporter in terms of value, and Oregon 7th in the nation when measuring the total value of products sent abroad. Not only that, international trade is a key source of high-paying jobs. Close to a half million Oregon jobs are tied to, or supported by, trade. In the midst of the economic recession, Oregons trade-related employment grew 7.5 times faster than overall employment levels. These jobs benefit rural and urban Oregon alike, from high-tech companies to producers of the highly sought-after Oregon agricultural products. These are not just the big-name companies were all familiar with  over 90 percent of Oregons more than 5,000 exporters are small- and medium-sized businesses. While its important to consider Oregons place in the global economy when assessing trade agreements, its also important to make sure it is also good for the people in other countries. To do that we have to learn from the good, the bad and the ugly of our past trade policies and how they must evolve. For 20 years, Ive heard strong criticisms about the weak NAFTA agreement. I did not vote for NAFTA, which was rightly criticized for failing to provide enforceable environmental and labor protections. I understand the importance of such protections. Throughout my career in Congress, Ive fought to strengthen trade agreements to ensure that the good gets better, the bad happens less often, and the ugly is prevented. Like anyone who wants a strong and growing Oregon economy, Im a supporter of trade done right. If a trade agreement is not good for Oregonians or does not align with our values, I have not and will not support it. Trade Promotion Authority (TPA) sets the rules for the administrations pursuit of trade agreements and establishes how Congress will evaluate them. Im working to further strengthen TPA to make sure the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) and other future agreements not only help export more Oregon goods, but to export Oregons values as well by enacting fully enforceable human rights, labor and environmental protections. These important reforms do not simply happen on their own. They are the result of engaging in the process and pushing for improvement. For years thats exactly what Ive done. In the weeks and months ahead, thats exactly what Ill continue to do for Oregon, for our small businesses, and for our values. To learn more about my views on trade policy, I encourage you to visit my website. There you will also find a section on Frequently Asked Questions on Trade that addresses some of the many complicated issues surrounding TPP and TPA. You can also find an op-ed in The Oregonian that I jointly authored with Senator Wyden on why trade is critical to Oregon. Thank you for allowing me to share my thoughts on trade. I look forward to hearing from you on this and other issues important to Oregon.

[R-FL10]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email   Webster Wire Listening to Central Florida Dear Friends:  It was great to be home in the district last week. On Monday, I spent the day in Umatilla visiting different organizations and members of the community. It was Teacher Appreciation Week, so I took a letter of Congressional recognition to Social Studies teacher Justin Crouch, who won the Lake County Teacher of the Year Award. It was good to meet Principal Campbell at Umatilla High School, personally congratulate Mr. Crouch, and answer some of the civics questions from students in his class. Some of the other visits I made in Umatilla included: * Providing a Congressional update at the Umatilla Kiwanis Club * Hearing about the Family PrimeTime Reading Program initiated by the Umatilla Womens Club * Meeting Umatilla Mayor Brian Butler and other community leaders during a tour of Commissioner Laura Wrights Moss Gate Bed and Breakfast * Visiting the recently renovated Pearl Lane Apartment complex * Presenting a letter of Congressional recognition to Edward and Gina Waterman, who received the Citizens of the Year Award from the Umatilla Chamber of Commerce _________________________  Last Tuesday, I spent the day in Polk County, including a visit to W.E. Jones Group manufacturing plant in Lake Alfred. As an engineer by training, I enjoyed seeing the machines and robots that Jeff Jones has developed, meet his employees, and hear how he built his business from scratch. It was national Small Business Week as well, and very fitting to highlight Jeffs story of American ingenuity and hard work to build his business of making paper sleeves to protect nursery plants during transport. During my time in Polk County, I also: * Visited the Blue Cross Blue Shield Retail Center in Winter Haven * Toured the national WellCare Call Center with The Results Company * Presented a flag to Inman Park Baptist Church for their new flagpole * Stopped by to see the new Purple Heart Memorial in Lake Alfred * Met Ginny Wolfe, the new Executive Director for the Lake Alfred Chamber of Commerce * Spoke to rising leaders in the Winter Haven Civil Air Patrol squadron _________________________  As a member of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee in Congress, I am heavily involved in my Subcommittees on Highways and Transit; Water Resources and Environment; and Railroads, Pipelines, and Hazardous Materials. On Wednesday, I participated in a roundtable discussion at Visit Orlando that gathered local industry leaders to discuss issues related to transportation and tourism in Central Florida. It was helpful to hear directly from representatives of Disney, Universal Orlando, SeaWorld, Orlando International Airport, and major hoteliers in the area. Some of the other Orange County events last week included: * Providing the keynote address at the 2016 Florida Institute of Consulting Engineers (FICE) Transportation Conference * Touring Quest, Inc. in Orlando, meeting the developmentally challenged children they assist, and donating an American flag for their upcoming silent auction * Delivering a letter of Congressional recognition to Stacie Forrett, the General Manager at the new Wawa in Orlando _________________________  Thursday was the National Day of Prayer, and I was privileged to begin the day at the annual Kiwanis Prayer Breakfast, presented by the Clermont, Minneola, and South Lake Kiwanis Clubs. At noon, many residents of Lake County took their lunch break to gather together in Tavares and pray for our country. It was an honor to join local officials, pastors, and community members to ask God to bless America. I made several other visits in Lake County last week, including: * Speaking at the 2015 Child Protection Conference facilitated by the Lake County Shared Services Network * Presenting a flag to Sue Miller in gratitude and recognition of her son, Army Specialist Alex Miller, who gave the ultimate sacrifice in Afghanistan * Meeting with a group of homeschool students following their course on Constitutional Literacy * Honoring World War II veteran Arthur Burke, and delivering overdue medals that my office was able to acquire on his behalf * Touring Come As You Are Ministry in Leesburg * Meeting Pastor John Lodge from Solid Rock Evangelical Fellowship * Delivering a Congressional update at the Lake County League of Cities luncheon * Recognizing the 135th anniversary of Gethsemane Missionary Baptist Church * Providing a copy of the Congressional Journal that recognized the 40th anniversary of Bay Street Players in Eustis It is an honor to represent you in the United States House of Representatives. Your servant,  Daniel Webster Member of Congress     Constituent Corner After living in Haiti for mission work, a constituent from Central Florida met and married a Haitian native. Although she had filed an immigrant visa petition, which was approved by the U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services, they were still waiting for the Department of State (DOS) to complete the next phase of the visa processing. The couple were expecting their first child, and she wanted to return home to the United States with her husband before she became too pregnant to travel. My office was able to contact the DOS who agreed to expedite the case and send it straight to the Embassy for processing. Shortly afterward, we received notice that the interview had been scheduled and the requested visa was approved and issued. Constituent services is a critical element of our congressional office. The federal government is a massive operation, and my office is available if you ever need assistance in navigating the bureaucracy or cutting through red tape. We are here to serve you. Survey Last week, the IRS and Justice Department appeared before a D.C. Circuit Court of Appeals in an attempt to defend themselves against a discrimination charge that they were corrupting their constitutional duties and the fair process of tax exemption. During oral arguments, the IRS was unable to provide the judges with credible grounds on which they had delayed the organizations tax exemption. Do you believe that the IRS should continue to be thoroughly examined and held accountable, specifically for the way they treat non-profit entities seeking tax exemption? * Yes  * No  * I don't know  ? Submit your Response  Response from the previous survey question,  ""Do you support Congress giving the Administration a ""fast track authority"" on trade?"" Yes - 11% No - 84% I don't know - 5% Legislative Update As we celebrated National Small Business Week, it was a pleasure to recognize the countless small businesses in Central Florida that have built their dream much like my father did when he and my mother started our familys business in the early 1960s. These industrious men and women form the backbone of our economy, and I am honored to recognize and support them. Some of the biggest hindrances to business success in America include our bloated tax code, overreaching government regulation, and the continued unintended consequences of the federal government's takeover of healthcare with Obamacare. One of my constituents from Lake Alfred came into my office this week to share her frustrating insurance experiences that have crippled the business she and her husband own and operate. It is the same story I have heard countless times, and I remain committed to working on these issues that continue to stand in the way of greater opportunities for business success and growth.

The event featured the Kansas State University Grand Chorus with professional orchestra, KSU Concert Choir, KSU InAChord and special guest alumna Jan Kraybill, Conservator of the Julia Irene Kauffman Casavant organ.

Teacher Appreciation Week  Honoring Elouise Miller During Teacher Appreciation Week, special thanks to all the teachers who care deeply about their students and challenge them to reach their goals. Just last week, Elouise Miller, a teacher who taught in the USD 489 school district for 60 years, passed away. Elouise was well-respected by administrators, fellow teachers, parents and students. She was considered a mentor not only as an educator, but also for her lifestyle and care and concern for kids and people in general. Click here  to learn more about her story.

[R-NC]","Richard Burr, US Senator North Carolina On Sunday, I joined ABCs Martha Raddatz on This Week and we discussed the Islamic States threat to the United States and the expiration of the Patriot Acts data collection provision at the end of the month. While speaking about the renewal of the Patriot Act, I noted that ""I do think it [Patriot Act] should continue for the simple reason it's very effective at keeping America safe. Watch my full interview by clicking below. [image = [link 1] Chairman Burr joins ABC's ""This Week"" [link 2] Sundays interview also addressed the Islamic States sobering announcement that they have over seventy trained soldiers in the United States waiting for the opportunity to attack Americans. In a few more days, one of our nations most successful tools against terrorism is set to expire, the Patriot Act. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell and I recently introduced a bill that would keep the Patriot Act up and running for about five more years. Last week, I took to the floor with other members of the Senate to talk about why the Patriot Act is so important: Why in the world would we thinkabout rolling back the toolsthat are the only tools that putus post-9/11 versus pre-9/11?The threat is greater todaydomestically and around theworld than it's ever been, andthe argument that [Congress] will beconsumed with is whether we doaway with tools that have beeneffective for law enforcement toprotect America.Madam president, I wouldsuggest that we reauthorize thisbill for five and a half years,as is.And that we make the samecommitment to the Americanpeople we do when we reauthorizeand fund the T.S.Awe're going tokeep America safe.We're not going to let it revertback to where we're susceptibleto another 9/11. Our goal should not be limiting the tools that our law enforcement and intelligence community have access to but protecting American lives. You can watch my full comments below. [image = [link 3] Were here today with a choice. The choice is whether we're going to reauthorize this program that has been very, very effective It's my choice to continue the program because the program has worked.  Chairman Burr [link 4] Wall Street Journal editorial board came out in support of a clean authorization of the Patriot Act last week which can be read here [link 5]. Wednesday, Senator Tillis and I introduced the Corolla Wild Horses Protection Act, a bill to provide for the responsible management of the wild-horse population around Corolla, North Carolina and the Outer Banks. The beauty of the Corolla horses draws people from across North Carolina to witness these wild animals in their natural habitat. They are one of our many natural state treasures and I am proud to introduce legislation that will provide for their preservation. You can read more about the Corolla Wild Horses Protection Act, here [link 6]. Lastweek, Senator Bennet and I introduced legislation that would fix current federal policy that keeps Medicare patients from receiving the most-cutting-edge medical technologies. This relatively simple bill will help seniors and veterans get new technologies that will enable them to heal faster so that they can enjoy a better quality of life. Read about the specifics of the bill here [link 7]. Earlier in May, a ceremony was held at the Arlington National Cemetery honoring the Montagnards, along with the unveiling of a new memorial commemorating their service and sacrifice. The Montagnards are an indigenous people from Vietnam who fought bravely alongside American vets during the Vietnam War but have received little to no recognition until recently [link 8]. [image = [link 9] At the ceremony honoring the Montagnards. North Carolina is home to the largest Montagnard community outside of Vietnam and our state is made better by their presence.

H.R. 2048 ends bulk collection of data, strengthens protections for civil liberties, increases transparency, and prevents government overreach, while also protecting national security.

[R-PA12]","Congressman Keith Rothfus Dear Lindsey, Major Jack Wallace, Commander of the Pennsylvania Army National Guards 1-104th ARB, and I met last week at their headquarters in Johnstown. We discussed efforts underway at the federal and state level to prevent the premature removal of Apache helicopters out of Johnstown. As I continue to argue, not a single airframe should be transferred before the National Commission on the Future of the Army completes its review of the Armys Aviation Restructure Initiative, which is the basis for the transfer, and the Initiatives impact on National Guard readiness. Once transfers begin, it will be all but impossible to undo the transfers should the Commission find that it is not in the national interest. The highly-trained airmen of the 1-104th have dedicated years of their military careers to operating and maintaining these Apache aircraft. Stripping the National Guard of its Apaches will deprive us of experienced aircrews and deeply hollow our reserve component here at home. Last week, I introduced an amendment to the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) to halt the removal of any Apache airframes. I will continue to fight to protect these critical attack airframes in Johnstown as the House considers the NDAA in the coming weeks.  As always, if you have questions, comments, or concerns, please do not hesitate to email me or contact one of my district offices.  Sincerely, Keith *Mental Health Awareness Month*:  May is Mental Health Awareness month, and this past week I had the opportunity to meet with the folks at Genoa pharmacy in Richland Township, Cambria County, to learn about the tools they developed to better serve mental health patients. One in four adults suffers from some form of mental health disorder. Companies like Genoa are committed to finding effective solutions to improving the health and well-being of members of our community. During my visit, I learned about new blue-tooth technology that actually alerts a pharmacist at Genoa if a patient misses a dosage so they can then call to check-in. Mental illness is an important issue in our country. With new innovations on the horizon and increased awareness, we can make a difference and prevent tragedies from occurring that are too often linked to mental illness.  *911th Deployment Send-Off*: This past week, over one-hundred troops from the 911th Airlift Wing deployed over several days out of the Pittsburgh International Airport Air Reserve Station for operations in Southwest Asia. I had the privilege to attend one of the send-offs and thank the families for all their sacrifices to protect our country and defend our liberties. Pictured in the top photograph below is Lt. Col. Bryan Branby, who will be the flying squadron commander and the bottom photograph is the family of a maintenance member who deployed this past Tuesday. Our thoughts and prayers go with them. *Meeting With Western Pennsylvanias Housing Authorities*: As a new member of the Committee on Financial Services Housing and Insurance Subcommittee, I spent a few days last week meeting with various housing industry stakeholders. I met with Directors and employees from the Housing Authority of Beaver, the Housing Authority of Somerset County, Action Housing in Pittsburgh, and the City of Pittsburgh Housing Authority. I was interested to hear their concerns, and listen to their feedback on federal initiatives like the Department of Housing and Urban Developments (HUDs) Moving To Work program, which fosters ways to help residents find jobs and achieve financial independence. The program directors provided me a wealth of information and ideas, and I look forward to continuing to work with them in my new committee role in Congress. *Rothfus With Executive Director Of The Beaver County Housing Authority* *Rothfus With City Of Pittsburgh Housing Authority Directors* *Around The District: Beaver Falls, North Hills, Pittsburgh, Johnstown  The National Day of Prayer has been practiced in our country since 1952, and every year the President issues a proclamation setting aside a day for the nation to join in prayer for our country. In observance of this years National Day of Prayer, which was held on Thursday, May 6, I spent my morning at the Beaver Falls Prayer Breakfast.  North Hills Middle School was given a prestigous School To Watch deisgnation for academic excellence. I spoke to a packed auditorium to congratulate the students, teachers, and school administrators for achieving this impressive designation.  Thank you for the leadership at Grane Supply for providing me a tour of the long-term care pharmacy. The pharmacy is very different from a retail pharmacy, and uses a number of unique tools to better serve the elderly at nursing home facilities.  Avonworth Middle School was also re-designated as a School to Watch and I was pleased to have an opportunity to connect with students and congratulate the school at a very nice reception this past Friday morning.  The photograph below is of the huge peace sign formed at the Johnstown Peace in the Valley March this past Friday. People of all ages came together to show solidarity and march for a better tomorrow.

I'm still collecting data for the report, and I want to hear from you on how you would grade our nation's infrastructure. Take a moment to grade America's infrastructure by responding to my survey  . Congress should know about the impact that inadequate infrastructure has had on our communities. Since March, I've collected hundreds of stories from constituents about the infrastructure challenges they face on a day-to-day basis. The responses I've received have been eye-opening. Hours-long commutes have pushed back family dinners, inadequate roads have hurt local businesses, and public transit has put rider safety at risk. If you haven't yet, share your story on how inadequate infrastructure has impacted you and your family  . The fact is that we need long-term infrastructure investment now. Without congressional action, the Highway Trust Fund, our nation's largest source of federal infrastructure projects, will become insolvent in less than one month. As I push for action in the House, I encourage you to grade America's infrastructure by responding to my survey  so I can include your thoughts in my report later this week. As I continue my work to act as a voice for Maryland families, I encourage you to stay up-to-date by following me on Facebook  and on Twitter  .

Click here to open a plain text version of this email   CONTACT  SERVICES  NEWS  ISSUES  LEGISLATION  Dear Friend,     The costs of higher education continue to rise, posing serious challenges to millions of students and their families  many of whom are being forced to take out larger loans to pay for tuition, fees, textbooks and housing. Thats why one of my top priorities in Congress is working to provide relief for borrowers who are struggling under the weight of student loan debt. Earlier this year, I cosponsored the Bank on Students Emergency Loan Refinancing Act to allow borrowers with existing student debt to refinance their loans to todays lower rates, putting money back into the pockets of working families trying to make ends meet. Every year in Washington state, 56 percent of graduates leave school with more than $23,000 in student debt. This bill would help 451,000 Washingtonians refinance their student loans.  While I was in Mount Vernon last week, I met with students from As the price of new, hardcopy textbooks continues to rise, students and faculty should be able to take advantage of digital textbooks, which are estimated to cost as much as 50 percent less than print textbooks. To help students achieve these cost-savings, the E-BOOK Act would expand the availability of e-readers and tablet computers for low-income students and provide faculty with the tools to effectively incorporate digital learning into their instruction.Skagit Valley College. We discussed the need for innovative ways to reduce the cost of higher education, such as legislation I recently introduced  called the E-BOOK Act. This bill would expand students access to digital course materials, providing an important opportunity to reduce the cost of textbooks for students and their families. In the months and years to come, I will continue to fight for solutions that put students first and ensure higher education is never out of reach. I came to Congress to find solutions and deliver results, and as we move forward on these issues, Ill keep fighting for effective policies that work for our nations students and graduates. I wouldnt be where I am today without the financial aid and loans that helped me to get a great education. Im committed to ensuring todays students have the same opportunities that were available to me. As always, my office is here to serve you.

junior,"113,114,115",Male,N00027441,412248,"Corker, Bob (Sen.) [R-TN]","Bob Corker - U.S. Senator, Tennessee *Giving the American People a Voice on Any Deal with Iran* *By U.S. Senator Bob Corker* It is hard to recall a time in history when pragmatic U.S. leadership around the world mattered more to our nations security and prosperity. >From the brutality of ISIS as they recruit foreign fighters, seize swaths of territory, kidnap innocent civilians, and murder Christians; to the appalling acts of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad killing his own people with barrel bombs and chlorine gas; to Russian President Vladimir Putins unlawful invasion and occupation of Ukraine; to Chinas aggressive behavior in the East and South China Seas; the challenges we face are vast. But there is perhaps no greater geopolitical issue facing the world today than preventing a nuclear-armed Iran. A nuclear Iran is a threat to every nation and would lead to a less safe and secure world. It also could create a dangerous arms race with the possibility of a nuclear weapon falling into the hands of terrorists. That is why the stakes are high as the United States and other world powers negotiate to try to dismantle Irans nuclear weapons capability. Any agreement with Iran will affect generations to come, which is why I am determined to ensure the American people  through their elected representatives in Congress  are given a voice on this consequential decision. It has been disappointing to see President Obama and his administration try to bypass the American people and go straight to the United Nations Security Council after stating any deal with Iran must pass muster with Congress. But last week  in a show of bipartisanship that is all too rare today in Washington  Republicans and Democrats in the Senate pushed back and sent a strong message to an administration notorious for its overreach. On Thursday, with an overwhelming vote of 98 to 1, the Senate passed the *Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act [link 1]*, a bill I introduced with colleagues on both sides of the aisle, to restrict President Obamas free hand and give the American people the voice this administration has tried so desperately to silence. Without this bill, the president would be able to immediately waive sanctions imposed by Congress and unilaterally implement an agreement with Iran. The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act does three things: First, it ensures transparency. The bill requires the president to submit to Congress the text and all details of any nuclear agreement with Iran, if one is reached. Second, it provides oversight. The bill prohibits the administration from suspending congressional sanctions for a period of time so Congress will have the opportunity to hold hearings before the American people. And while it will be a heavy lift, the bill ensures Congress has the chance, if it chooses, to pass a resolution of approval or disapproval of the agreement. Third, it holds Iran accountable. The bill requires the president to certify to Congress every 90 days that Iran is complying with an agreement. Should Iran cheat, the bill enables Congress to immediately reimpose sanctions. The bill now heads to the House of Representatives for consideration, where I hope it will receive swift action. When it comes to foreign policy, I firmly believe that partisanship should stop at our waters edge, which is why we have worked hard to keep our bipartisan bill focused on the appropriate role for Congress. A strong, negotiated agreement that will stand the test of time and stop Iran from obtaining a nuclear weapon is the preferred outcome. But as the major world powers work toward a final agreement, it is important our negotiators remain clear-eyed. The sooner we enact this bill, the sooner we can send a clear signal to Iran that Congress will play a role, which will give our negotiators an even stronger hand at the table and slow the administration from rushing headlong into a bad deal. When consequential decisions are made  decisions that will affect the type of world we leave behind to our children and grandchildren  your voice must be heard. With this bill, it will be. *Bob Corker is a U.S. senator for Tennessee and chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee.* ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- [link 1] Contact Information: Website: Share on Facebook: ",2013-01-03,,Sen.,Senator,true,TN,Senator_Bob_Corker@corker.enews.senate.gov,05/12/2015,Republican,65905,,http://www.corker.senate.gov,Junior Senator from Tennessee,Bob,SenBobCorker,,Corker,C001071,202-224-3344,1952-08-24,https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/bob_corker/412248,senatorcorker,,senator,1021114,Senator,2019-01-03,Sen.

[D-VA]"," Nine Months Into War, And Still No Congressional Debate On The Use Of Military Force Against ISIL    5.12.15 Nine Months Into War, And Still No Congressional Debate On The Use Of Military Force Against ISIL Dear Friend, Last week I spoke on the Senate floor to recognize an anniversary  nine months since the U.S. has been at war against ISIL. As I spoke, I reminded my fellow senators of all that our country has sacrificed since we began this military mission. We have deployed thousands of troops to the region, including the Norfolk-based Roosevelt Carrier Strike Group. We have lost the lives of American servicemembers and seen hostages killed in the most gruesome of ways. And we have spent more than two billion in taxpayer funding to launch more than 3,000 airstrikes against the terrorist group. But heres what still hasnt happened: Congress has not done its job to debate and vote on an authorization for this war. This silence is shameful, and our servicemembers deserve better. In places far from their homes and families, thousands of members of our Armed Forces are risking their lives on behalf of a mission that Congress has refused to address for nine long months. Their sacrifice should call us to step up, do our jobs and finally define and authorize this ongoing war. With passage of the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act last week, the Senate proved it can act in a bipartisan way to assert an appropriate Congressional role on another critical matter of foreign policy - a nuclear deal with Iran. But meanwhile, our inaction on ISIL leaves the impression that Congress is either indifferent about the threat the group poses or lacks the backbone to do the job it is supposed to do. So I once again challenge my colleagues to take this seriously and to promptly debate and pass an authorization for military action against ISIL.

Miller Applauds House Passage of Defense Authorization that Protects A-10s Defense authorization for FY16 prevents the Air Force from divesting the A-10 fleet, improves pay and benefits for troops, and provides tools needed to help troops safely complete their missions. WASHINGTON D.C.  Today, Rep. Candice Miller (MI-10), Vice Chair of the House Homeland Security Committee and Chairman of the Subcommittee on Border and Maritime Security, issued the following statement on House passage of the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for Fiscal Year 2016, which includes a provision preventing the Air Force from divesting the A-10 aircraft: The recent deployment of A-10s out of Selfridge Air National Guard Base, along with A-10s from Indiana, to the Middle East to combat ISIS in Iraq and Syria is testament to the aircrafts effectiveness in theater and its role in our national defense. However, notwithstanding its success and the troops on the ground who rely on its air coverage, this Administration has repeatedly tried to retire the fleet. Fortunately, thus far, each attempt has been met with overwhelming opposition in Congress, and, today, the House voted again to protect the important mission of the A-10 by passing the National Defense Authorization Act, which protects the fleet from divestment in FY16. For those of us who have fought for the A-10 over the years, todays vote was another important victory, but it is only a step in what will be another hard-fought battle to keep the A-10s operating. In addition to moving the defense authorization through the Senate without the addition of amendments aimed at retiring the A-10 aircraft, going forward, I expect some will attempt to retire the fleet through the upcoming appropriations process. As I have done in the past, I will continue to fight efforts to divest the fleet until the Air Force identifies a follow-on aircraft that can protect combat troops on the ground as well as the A-10 does. I want to express my gratitude to my colleagues in the House, as well as in the Senate, who have and will continue to fight with me to protect the A-10s and the troops who rely on their protection. The defense authorization legislation that passed the House today is a strong defense bill focused on protecting the brave men and women who put themselves in harms way to protect this country from threats, both foreign and domestic. In addition to providing greater resources that help them safely carry out their mission, this bill includes important provisions that improve the pay and benefits our military personnel and their families rely on. Finally, I want to express my gratitude to the brave men and women who serve this country, including the airmen and women recently deployed into theater to fight for the liberties and freedoms we hold dear. I pray for their safety and success on this important mission. ###   CONNECT WITH US     Washington D.C.

,114,Male,N00033720,43686,"Allen, Rick (Rep.) [R-GA12]","Friend, I enjoyed the opportunity to spend last week visiting with Georgians throughout the 12th district. On Tuesday, I made my first official visit to Fort Gordon to tour the installation and receive briefings on operations and recent growth at the base. I appreciated hearing from Major General Stephen Fogarty and Garrison Commander Colonel Sam Anderson about priorities for the installation, including needed infrastructure updates. Fort Gordon is an incredible asset to our military, and our district is proud to be the home of its critical missions. After touring Fort Gordon, I spoke at the Augusta Young Professionals meeting about the latest business before Congress. I was also grateful to be the keynote speaker at the Mayor's Prayer Breakfast in Augusta last Thursday, which was the National Day of Prayer. What a great way to reflect upon the blessings we have as a nation and the power of faith in confronting the challenges before us. I always look forward to visiting schools throughout our district, and on Friday, I was able to recognize several young students for excellence in reading. These students participated in a Congressional challenge and read 20 or more books between September and December last year. It was a lot of fun to visit Appling County Primary and Elementary Schools and Collins Elementary and Middle School to congratulate the students and present them with a special certificate! I hope all mothers in Georgia's 12th district had a wonderful Mother's Day with family and friends. As a son, husband, father, and grandfather, I am grateful every day for the selfless compassion and love of the wonderful mothers in my family and across our country. On April 29, Robin and I welcomed our eighth grandchild and our daughter Robin Anne's second daughter, Ellis Herrington Wills. We are truly blessed by this newest addition to our family and appreciate all the kind wishes we received from across the district. Thank you to all the Georgians in the 12th district who took time to share their views with me last week. I look forward to bringing your input back to Washington as the House returns to session today. Sincerely, Rick Rick W.

[R-NY27]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email  News from Representative Chris Collins chris collins top banner ABOUT  | CONTACT  | SERVICES  | LEGISLATION  facebook  tweeter  Dear Friends, It has been a busy few weeks, and I wanted to update you on what I have been working on both here in Western New York and in Washington, D.C. Manufacturing Universities Act  Standing with Sen. Gillibrand and Rep. Higgins to promote manufacturing in Western New York On April 17th, I joined Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Rep. Brian Higgins at Praxair in Tonawanda to promote, the Manufacturing Universities Act  , legislation I introduced in the House. As a small business owner who worked in manufacturing for over 35 years, I understand the difficulty in training and finding qualified manufacturing workers. To expand manufacturing in Western New York, we need to have a workforce capable of filling these skilled jobs. This bipartisan legislation aims to fix this problem by providing universities with the funding they need to properly equip students with the resources needed to fill highly skilled job openings in the manufacturing and engineering industries. Fighting Fast Track Trade Promotion for the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) As I have stated since the start of this year, the Obama Administration's current negotiations on a massive trade agreement known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) will hurt American jobs. Over the past few months, thousands of Western New Yorkers have reached out to my office expressing their concerns and asking my stance on the TPP Fast Track trade deal. I want to again reassure you that I oppose granting President Obama fast track authority to negotiate free trade agreements and will vote against any bill that ships Western New Yorkers' jobs overseas. House and Senate Agree on Budget that Will Balance in Ten Years The House passed a budget that will cut spending by $5 trillion over ten years, will repeal Obamacare, and will balance the federal budget. This budget puts our country on the best path to pay off our debt, while increasing economic opportunity and improving government efficiency. This budget also calls for a fairer, simpler tax code that will jump start our economy and leave more money in your pocket. Ensuring Children's Access to Specialty Care Act  In April, I introduced HR 1859, the Ensuring Children's Access to Specialty Care Act Mental illness impacts one in every five of America's young people, and unfortunately, we are facing an extreme shortage of health care professionals equipped to care for these individuals. To combat this problem, I joined with Congressman Courtney, from Connecticut's 2nd District, in introducing the Ensuring Children's Access to Specialty Care Act  . This bipartisan legislation provides incentives for doctors with pediatric specialties to practice in undeserved areas. I will continue working to improve health care for all Americans in my role as a member of the Health Subcommittee on the Energy and Commerce Committee. Visiting Businesses and Schools Across NY-27 One of my many stops around Western New York during April's district work period was the Rochester and Southern Railroad, part of Genesee and Wyoming Inc. located in Retsof. During the visit, I had the opportunity to meet with employees and learn about the important work they do with companies around the area. Genesee and Wyoming Inc. was founded in Livingston County and now has over 100 freight lines operating around the world.  I heard some great questions from students at Honeoye Falls-Lima Middle School I was also able to visit Honeoye Falls-Lima Middle School and answer some great questions from 8th grade students about important issues facing our country. Earlier this year, I received a letter from Fiona, a student at Honeyoye Falls, asking if I could come speak to her class. Thank you so much for the invitation and I enjoyed the time I was able to spend with your class. I want to wish the best of luck to all of these students who move on to high school in a few months. As always, if you have any comments or concerns please reach out to any of my Congressional offices. With Best Regards,  CHRIS COLLINS Member of Congress Washington D.C.

From veterans advocacy, to standing up for LGBT rights, my office is here to serve. Veterans Listening Forum This March, I fulfilled a promise I made to our local veterans: to bring Loma Linda VA Hospital leadership directly to the veterans they serve to answer questions and listen to veterans experiences first hand, and find solutions together. Over 120 veterans from our community joined in our conversation with the leadership of the Loma Linda VA Hospital. They shared personal experiences, ideas, and in some cases, frustrations, which the VA promised to address. While we have made some progress, we still have a lot more work to do. Through the Veterans Access, Choice and Accountability Act of 2014, locally the VA will be filling 200 positions, including 34 new physicians, and will provide additional weekend and evening hours. And while this is good news, we must continue to hold the VA accountable and make sure that these investments result in better, high quality veteran centeredcare. In the future, I will be hosting additional listening forums to give more veterans the opportunity to share their experiences at Loma Linda, and to get updates on the changes the VA has promised. New Office Opening To better serve you, I consolidated my offices into a new, centrally located office in Palm Desert. This new, full service location allows my office to operate more efficiently and effectively. Additionally, my staff will hold regular satellite office hours across the district to ensure all have access to the services my office offers. The new Palm Desert office is located at: 43875 Washington Street, Suite F Palm Desert, CA 92211 Congressional Art Competition On May 4, I was thrilled to announce the winner of this years Congressional Art Competition, Audrey Castillo from Palo Verde High School in Blythe. Her artwork, My Little Brothers Curiosity, was selected by a panel of judges to represent our communities, and will be on display in the U.S. Capitol Building for one year. Audrey and a guest will be flown to Washington D.C. for a special reception to celebrate all of the Congressional Art Competition winners from across the country. You can see a picture of Audrey and her amazing work below. Thank you to all our high schools and student artists who submitted artwork to the 2015 CA-36 Congressional Art Competition! We received over 60 submissions from students, all of which just prove how much talent we have in this district. My office in Palm Desert will continue to display the students artwork through July 8th, so please stop by to see some outstanding pieces of art created by local students, including second place winner Jean Cedenos Our Loving Valley, and third place winner Alondra Manzos Thalassophobia. Advocacy for LGBT Rights The so-called, religious freedom law recently passed in Indiana could allow businesses and other entities to actively discriminate against the LGBT community and has no place in our society. All Americans, no matter your gender, race, age, religion, or who you love, deserve marriage equality and equal rights under the law. In response to this injustice, I led 34 Members of Congress in a letter to Governors of 11 states considering legislation similar to the discriminatory law passed in Indiana that would allow businesses to openly discriminate against LGBT Americans asking they reject discrimination on any and all levels. I will always be an advocate and voice for equality, and stand up against efforts that threaten to roll back the headway we have made here in California and across our country. To read the full letter, click here. Its an honor to serve as your Representative in Washington, D.C. Serving my constituents is about ensuring that every voice in our community is heard and that you have a steadfast advocate when you need one.

[R-KY5]","FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: May 13, 2015 CONTACT: Danielle Smoot, (606) 679-8346 Rogers Votes to Block EPA Water Rule WASHINGTON, D.C. - U.S. Rep. Harold 'Hal' Rogers (KY-05) cosponsored and voted for the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act of 2015 (H.R. 1732) as the bill passed the full House on Tuesday, May 12. The bill reverses a rule proposed by the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in April 2014 to redefine the ""Waters of the United States"" through the Clean Water Act, expanding the agency's jurisdiction to include dry beds and other areas that are ""seasonal or rain-dependent."" ""This bill will block one of the EPA's biggest efforts to gain power in the US, keeping this rouge agency from taking over every hollow and valley that may have a stream running through it when it rains,"" said Rogers. ""The EPA's rule threatens jobs and our economy. It also restricts landowners and local governments from moving forward with important development projects, so H.R. 1732 is critical to reversing the costly impact of this rule across the country, putting the decisions regarding our nation's waters back into the hands of those who know best."" The bill requires the Secretary of the Army and the Administrator of the EPA to withdraw the 2014 proposed rule to redefine ""Waters of the United States"" within 30 days of enactment. The legislation holds the EPA and the U.S. Corps of Engineers accountable by requiring that when developing a new rule, the agencies must consider public comments, economic analysis, and must jointly consult with State and local officials about redefining the term ""waters of the United States."" This will ensure that Kentucky farmers, miners, small business owners, and entrepreneurs have the ability to create jobs and grow the local economy. Rogers urged the Senate to move swiftly in reversing the EPA's proposed rule. Rogers has served Kentuckys 5th Congressional District since 1981. With a focus on economic development, job creation, fighting illegal drugs and preserving Appalachias natural treasures, he has a reputation for listening to his constituents and fighting for the region he represents.

The incident occurred on Friday when four Iranian naval vessels surrounded the U.S.-flagged Maersk Kensington in the Strait of Hormuz. The episode came ahead of an encounter Tuesday in which Iran Revolutionary Guard patrol boats fired shots at a commercial cargo ship and then intercepted the vessel, the Marshall Islands-flagged M. Leadership is also assessing a plan for forward- and back-fitting existing and future LCSs with frigate capabilities where it makes the most sense, she added. The acquisition and backfitting strategy is due to the defense secretary by May, a deadline mandated by then-Secretary Chuck Hagel in a Dec. 11, 2014, memorandum. ""First, by next May, the Navy will provide the secretary of defense with an acquisition strategy to support design and procurement of the SSC no later than fiscal year 2019, while continuing to identify further opportunities to enhance the new ship's survivability and lethality,"" according to the memo. ""Second, also by next May, the Navy will provide a detailed assessment of the cost and feasibility of back-fitting the SSCs enhancements onto LCSs already under contract."" Kent declined to comment on specific elements of the acquisition strategy or the forward- and back-fitting assessment. ""The Navy looks forward to continued dialogue with Congress through the coming months on the latest developments of the frigate acquisition process,"" Kent said. When the Navy does submit a frigate strategy to OSD, it may fall far short of the mandate the Pentagon sketched out last year. Navy officials last month previewed a framework that appears to lack many of the details of a full-up acquisition roadmap, instead laying out a skeleton path ahead for the program, Inside the Navy reported in April. The document will not include a decision on multiyear or block buys, a potential downselect, or a plan to backfit the planned upgrades to existing ships, LCS program officials said. -- Lara Seligman House Panel Rejects Navy's Plea, Moves To Tighten Cruiser Availabilities  Inside Defense The Republican-led House Armed Services Committee is moving forward with a plan to further restrict the term of planned cruiser availabilities, rejecting concerns expressed by the chief of naval operations and an influential Democrat on the panel that the new approach to phased modernization will delay the upgrades and eliminate cost savings. The panel on April 29 defeated an amendment introduced by Ranking Member Joe Courtney (D-CT) that would have blocked the seapower and projection forces subcommittee's ""2-2-6"" proposal to reduce the term of cruiser availabilities from four years to just two. The amendment was defeated by a 24-38 vote. ""2-2-6"" is a shift from the ""2-4-6"" plan mandated by the Fiscal Year 2015 National Defense Authorization Act, which would allow the Navy to place two ships in reduced operating status each year, for no more than four years at a time, and would limit the number cruisers out of service at once to six. But the subcommittee in its mark-up of the FY-16 defense authorization bill moved to further limit the Navy's ability to execute long-term phased modernization in order to ensure the service's commitment to maintain and upgrade, rather than retire, the ships, subcommittee Chairman Randy Forbes (R-VA) said during the full committee markup. The Navy has not included money to modernize the cruisers in its future years defense plan, Forbes noted, pointing out that the Navy originally asked Congress for permission to retire the ships altogether. ""If they were serious about this they would put the funding in the FYDP. They did not do that,"" Forbes said. ""If we let those cruisers go in there for that 2-4-6 program, we'll never see these cruisers in service again."" In a statement released after the mark-up, Forbes called the Navy's original plan to place the 11 cruisers in modernization at the same time ""a fantasy,"" and expressed deep skepticism of the service's commitment to maintaining the vessels. ""Anyone who has followed the Navy's evolution on cruisers would be understandably skeptical of their commitment to maintaining these critical assets in the Fleet. After first proposing to eliminate the cruisers entirely, they later claimed they would simply place them in an extended period of inactivity, to be miraculously awakened at some point in the distant future,"" Forbes said, according to the statement. ""This plan was a fantasy and, as the demand for large surface combatants and missile defense assets has grown, it failed to address the very real requirements of our combatant commanders."" In defeating the amendment, the panel soundly rejected a plea by CNO Adm. Jonathan Greenert asking Congress to reconsider ""2-2-6."" Greenert wrote in an April 28 letter to committee Chairman Mac Thornberry (R-TX) that the proposed language would eliminate all cost savings, create logistical challenges and strain the industrial base. In particular, the proposed two-year period does not support manpower reductions, one area in which the Navy hoped to realize cost savings, Greenert noted. The proposal would also accelerate spending and deplete the Ship Modernization, Operations, and Sustainment Fund by FY-18 -- more than one year earlier than the estimated FY-19 depletion date for the ""2-4-6"" plan, Greenert wrote. Significantly, Greenert wrote that ""2-2-6"" would force the Navy to delay induction of two cruisers, the Chosin (CG-65) and the Vicksburg (CG-69) from FY-16 until FY-19 due to the two-year procurement lead time for equipment. The Navy has already begun executing ""2-4-6"" in accordance with the law, with the induction of the Gettysburg (CG-64) in FY-15. In addition, the proposed language would result in retirement of the Ticonderoga-class cruisers by 2035, while ""2-4-6"" would have extended the lives of the ships out to 2038, Greenert wrote. ""The longer modernization periods increase competition and flexibility for the industrial base,"" Greenert wrote. ""The proposed 2-2-6 plan would remove the ability to schedule the industrial periods efficiently, resulting in degraded opportunities for small businesses and reduced cost benefit opportunities for the government, and ultimately impose a higher cost as well as disruptions to shipyard loading."" Speaking with reporters after an event at the National Press Club on April 30, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus expressed similar concerns about ""2-2-6,"" and said the Navy is working with Congress to address the issue. Despite Forbes' mistrust of the administration, Mabus stressed the Navy is now ""one hundred percent"" committed to modernizing the cruisers. Mabus said he is open to any ""prescriptive language"" Congress might add to the defense policy bill that would mandate the Navy buy materials for the modernization upfront, which might help assure skeptics the service is serious about maintaining the ships. ""It's a matter of [Congress] just not quite trusting us -- people have used bad language in the past, 'layups,' 'decommissioning,' things like that, which is not the case,"" Mabus said. ""We thought we came up with the best way to keep the most cruisers in for the longest time at the most affordable way, but obviously they get the last word."" Mabus acknowledged, however, that the Navy does not include funding in its FYDP to modernize the cruisers. - Randy Forbes: Navy Has No Credibility On Cruisers -Breaking Defense WASHINGTON: The cruiser war continues. With House seapower subcommittee chairman Randy Forbes declaring the Navy has no credibility when they promise to modernize aging Ticonderoga-class cruisers, House Republicans and Navy leaders are accelerating towards a public collision. Last week, Forbes rolled out legislation requiring the Navy to modernize the cruisers twice as fast as planned, in just two years per ship instead of four. On Tuesday, the Chief of Naval Operations urged Congress to get rid of Forbes provision, saying the faster pace it mandates would cost an extra $300 to $400 million. On Wednesday, the full House Armed Services Committee sided with Forbes against the Navy. Yesterday, Navy Secretary Ray Mabus suggested several ways that Congress could make sure the cruisers got modernized without having to accelerate the pace. This afternoon, Rep. Forbes told me Mabuss alternatives werent good enough. I think he misses the point, Forbes told me when I summarized what Mabus had said. There are things the Navy could do to give Congress confidence on cruiser modernization, Forbes said, but they arent the measures Mabus suggested yesterday. There are two steps they could have taken, Forbes said. One could have been to start to do the modernization. So far, work hasnt begun. The second thing they could have done is show that theyve put money in the FYDP [Future Year Defense Plan]. They cant come over here to us and say, oh yes, its our plan to do this, but were not going to put it in the five-year FYDP. Cruiser upgrades are paid for from a special Ship Modernization, Operations and Sustainment Fund  which was created by Congress in 2013 because it didnt trust the Navy to spend money from its regular accounts on the Ticonderogas. SMOSF (rhymes with Joseph) will run out in 2018 or 2019: 18 on the faster two-year-per-ship plan Forbes prefers, 19 on the slower four-year-per-ship plan the Navy prefers. Both date are within the five-year planning window of the current FYDP, so either way, the Navys five-year budget plan should show an infusion of money to replenish the fund and finish the work on the remaining cruisers  but it doesnt. They have no credibility, Forbes said. Theyve got to show where theyve put some money to do it. Of course, there are political reasons for the Navy not to commit the money. Ive heard two main ones from knowledgeable sources. First, it could be a ploy to make Congress cough up the money as a plus-up to the Navy budget: You want the cruisers so darn much, you find a way to pay for em, because we arent cutting any of our other programs to do it. Second, it could be a signal the Navy wants to reopen the whole issue of the modernization timeline. The Navys original plan wasnt to modernize a few cruisers at a time, taking four years per ship. It was to take 11 out of service at once and slowly modernize them over 11 years. The service estimates this slow-motion modernization would save some $4.5 billion badly needed for top-priority programs like new nuclear-missile submarines and aircraft carriers. Its a plan that Navy leaders still say is their first choice. The Navy wants to continue the discussion on CG [cruiser] modernization and advocate for the PB-15 plan to modernize 11 CGs over a phased modernization period [of 11 years], a defense official told me. The CNOs letter to Congress clearly articulates the benefits for the Navys proposal and Secretary Mabus indicated the service would welcome congressional language that held the Navy accountable for executing its original plan. But Forbes thinks the Navy proposals are simply ways to slow-roll Congress until the admirals can scrap the aging and expensive-to-operate warships. After all, in past years, the Navy had proposed retiring up to seven cruisers to save money for higher-priority programs. They really dont want to do the modernization, Forbes told me. What the Navy really wants to do is what they did from day one: They want to take seven of these cruisers out of commission and destroy them. When Congress rejected that proposal, he said, then they came back with this Disney type of fairy tale[:] What we meant to say is we dont want to kill them, we just want to put them in a deep sleep.' Forbes thought the Navys 11-year modernization plan was a backdoor attempt to decommission the ships. He thinks the current four years-per-ship plan is still too slow and leaves the Navy too much room to slow-roll Congress. Thats why he wants the acceleration to two years per ship: It will force the Navy to get started. The Navy argues that going from four years to two doesnt give the shipyards enough leeway to manage their workflow, resulting in lower efficiency and higher costs. Forbes doesnt agree and says the shipyards dont either: The shipyards are not buying what theyre trying to sell there, he told me, [but] they [the Navy] right now are putting pressure on these yards not to say what they can do with these cruisers. If the Navy opens the bidding to yards on both coasts, there should be someone somewhere who can do it efficiently and inexpensively. If you want to just do away with the cruisers, we will save money, Forbes said. But strategically you pay an enormous price. Retirement Reform Advances In House  Navy Times The House Armed Services Committee has adopted a $612 billion defense authorization bill for fiscal 2016 that would radically reform military retirement but rejects changes to a host of other benefit trims proposed by the Pentagon. By a 60-2 vote, the committee approved the annual budget legislation after almost 19 hours of debate, setting the stage for a full House vote in mid-May. The bill is one of the most-followed measures in the defense community, because of the hundreds of policy renewals and revisions involved. This year, the roster includes provisions again rejecting Defense Department pleas for another base closure round; full funding for commissary operations despite Pentagon calls for trims; and passive support for a 2.3 percent pay raise despite White House insistence that a lower, 1.3 percent hike would better help control personnel costs. The measure also outlines plans to plus-up temporary contingency operations funding to more than $89 billion next year in an effort to get around spending caps mandated under the 2011 Budget Control Act. White House officials have threatened to veto any budget bills that fail to repeal those spending caps, but Republicans in Congress instead have opted to use the contingency funding as a way to boost military spending without providing budget relief for other, non-defense agencies. The retirement reforms  which follow recommendations from a two-year independent commission review  would update the current 20-year, all-or-nothing system with a blended benefits package featuring 401(k)-style investments for all troops. Supporters have praised the move as finally giving some retirement benefits to the 83 percent of troops who serve less than 20 years, but opponents worry that plans to cut retirement payouts by one-fifth could hurt retention of senior service members. The measure includes a number of new provisions for handling of sexual assault cases, including expanded access to legal resources for victims and improved services for male victims. But the House panel again rejected efforts to separate those prosecutions from the military chain of command, a priority of some advocates who argue the military justice system has proved inadequate to handle such cases. The pay raise issue likely is only a temporary victory for supporters of a bigger boost to troops wallets. Although panel members said they support the larger raise, they did not include any specific language in the bill mandating the 2.3 percent hike. If the full House and Senate follow suit, that would allow President Obama to easily substitute his preferred lower, 1.3 percent hike later this year. Unlike last year, the authorization bill draft does not include a freeze on basic pay for general and flag officers in paygrades O-7 through O-10. Lawmakers also dismissed Pentagon plans to further trim back housing allowances, another personnel cost-savings move made in last years bill. The bill does include a provision dealing with the backlog of military families waiting for child care, mandating that DoD cut that waiting list in half over the next two fiscal years. Lawmakers blocked DoD requests to retire the A-10 Warthog and bumped up Pentagon aircraft acquisition requests over White House objections. The measure also includes controversial language designed to block the closing of detention facilities at Guantanamo Bay Naval Base in Cuba, a recurring fight between Capitol Hill conservatives and Obama. The full House is expected to consider the defense authorization bill draft in mid-May, and the Senate Armed Services Committee expected to offer its own version around the same time. Lawmakers will spend much of the summer reconciling the House and Senate version of the bills in hopes of sending the measure to Obamas desk before the Oct. 1 start of the new fiscal year. Veterans Affairs Nominee: 'The VA Needs Change'  Military Times Dr. David Shulkin, the Obama administration's nominee for undersecretary of health at Veterans Affairs, told lawmakers Tuesday he would work to create a VA medical system that would provide veterans superior care while attracting top talent to its ranks. Shulkin, president of the 687-bed Morristown Medical Center and an internist who has served as chief medical officer or CEO of major medical facilities since 1991, said the VA's failings in the past year  appointment wait times, bloated construction costs, lack of accountability and more  and its fledgling transformation efforts have created a ripe environment for ""dramatic change."" ""The VA needs change. The VA needs more doctors, more nurses and greater efficiency from its current systems,"" Shulkin said during his confirmation hearing before the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. In what was largely an amicable hearing, senators nonetheless quizzed Shulkin on several current VA black marks, including the $1 billion construction overruns at the VA hospital in Denver, veterans sickened by Agent Orange years after serving in Vietnam and the VA Choice program, which doesn't allow veterans to use the system if they live within 40 miles of a VA health facility, even if the facility doesn't offer the services they need. Calling the ongoing $1.73 billion construction debacle a ""monument to ineptitude in construction,"" Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., asked Shulkin what he thought of VA's plan to use a portion of construction money included in a sweeping reform bill last year to complete the project. ""I would make sure any solution doesn't come at the expense of treatment of veterans,"" Shulkin said. Shulkin would be the first permanent replacement to the post since Dr. Robert Petzel took early retirement during the heightening scandal at VA last year over appointment wait times. The internal medicine specialist, who earned his medical degree from the Medical College of Pennsylvania and served as chief medical officer of his alma mater and Temple University Hospital as well as CEO and President of Beth Israel Medical Center, said he would use his business skills to work with VA Secretary Robert McDonald to eliminate gaps in quality and improve care. When asked why he wanted the job, he told senators of his family history, which includes his father, Dr. Mark Shulkin, who served as an Army psychiatrist, and his grandfather, a pharmacist at VA. ""I believe it is my duty to serve those who serve our country and I believe I can help,"" he said. Sen. Johnny Isakson, R-Okla., said he was grateful that a nominee with such experience would be willing to take the job. But he warned that VA is a ""monolithic organization"" that would be a challenge for anyone to manage. ""VA needs to be improved and be a responsive organization ... Quite frankly, there's an attitude within the Veterans Health Administration of denial in terms of some of the problems that exist in the system,"" Isakson said. Congress Adds $60 Million To Navy Submarine Upgrades  Defense Tech Lawmakers have added $60 million toward submarine upgrades to include unmanned aerial vehicles, torpedo enhancements and combat systems modernization. The funding initiative, which moved the $60 million from Navy destroyer modernization over to submarine research and development, was put in place during the 2016 defense bill mark up by Rep. Randy Forbes, R-Va., chairman of the House Armed Services Committees Seapower and Projection Forces subcommittee. The undersea domain has been an area of historical U.S. advantage, from World War II to the Cold War. To ensure our dominance in the years ahead, we must begin investing in technologies that hold the potential to sustain American undersea power. As our potential competitors make significant investments in the undersea realm, the U.S. must continue researching and developing the undersea technologies of the future, Forbes said. The R&D submarine funding is specifically earmarked for particular projects, including the development and deployment of undersea underwater and aerial unmanned vehicles. One of the programs is called Fleet Modular Autonomous Unmanned Vehicle  a rapid development program to provide the Navy with the capability to safely ship, stow, and deploy an autonomous undersea vehicle with lithium batteries from a submarine torpedo tube. This technology also provides the capability to download mission data without physically docking to the submarine, Congressional sources said. In addition, the dollars are allocated toward engineering submarine-launched Unmanned Aerial Systems also designed to deploy from a submarine torpedo tube for over-the-horizon targeting. Additional funding for this effort will accelerate the development of a militarized antenna as well as an electronic warfare and cyber payload for the platform. About $5.5 million of the funding is slated for hardware and software upgrades to the MK48 Heavyweight Torpedo weapons system. Additional torpedo upgrades include an initiative called the Torpedo Advanced Processor Build designed to improve computer processing speeds for the weapon and improve its probability of destroying targets. These improvements impact the weapons navigation system, target motion analysis and improved payload ballistics, Congressional officials explained. Other areas of undersea innovation specified by the funding initiative are referred to as submarine combat and weapons control modernization efforts. This program will develop commercial off-the-shelf based software and hardware upgrades to integrate improved weapons control technologies for several submarine classes. This includes a technology which enables a torpedo to prepare to fire in less than one minute. Called attack in a minute, this new technology hinges upon new software prototypes and designs, officials explained. The stepped up funding for submarine technology is not surprising in light of the increased attention to the pace of global undersea modernization. Russia and China, in particular, are known to be making great strides when it comes to undersea technologies. A recent study said emerging submarine detection technologies, computer processing power and platforms such as underwater drones could quickly erode the U.S. militarys global undersea dominance and ability to operate in high-threat areas such as locations near enemy coastlines. The U.S. military relies upon submarines and undersea technological superiority for critical underwater intelligence, reconnaissance and surveillance missions, which place assets near the surface fleet or coastline of a potential adversary. In coming years, the technological margin of difference separating the U.S from potential rivals is expected to get much smaller, requiring the U.S. the re-think the role of manned submarines and prioritize innovation in the realm of undersea warfare, according to a January report by the Center for Strategic and Budgetary Assessments titled The Emerging Era in Undersea Warfare. Boeing Poised To Clinch $3 Billion-Plus Kuwait F/A-18 Order - Reuters WASHINGTON  Kuwait is expected to announce in coming weeks an order for 28 Boeing Co. F/A-18E/F Super Hornets, a $3 billion-plus deal that will keep the jets' St. Louis production line running well into 2019, according to people familiar with the deal. Kuwait, which operates a fleet of earlier F/A-18 models, has signed a formal letter stating its firm plans to buy newer-model Boeing jets, according to one of the people who is familiar with the deal but was not authorized to speak publicly. A second source confirmed that the U.S. government was working with Kuwait to approve the sale of advanced Boeing fighter jets, but gave no further details. One U.S. official said the proposed Kuwaiti purchase of Super Hornets would be discussed as part of President Barack Obama's summit meeting with Gulf Cooperation Council leaders next week but said it was not clear the deal would be finalized then. The expected deal would make Kuwait the second foreign country after Australia to order the new Boeing jets. U.S. government officials declined further comment. The Kuwait order, as well as separate moves by lawmakers to approve the U.S. Navy's request for 12 extra Super Hornets, should now provide sufficient comfort for Boeing to bet its own money to extend its St. Louis production line. It is currently slated to shut down at the end of 2017. Boeing spokeswoman Caroline Hutcheson said a near-term Middle Eastern order and congressional funding for 12 more Super Hornets would allow the company to continue delivering jets without a break in the production line. She said both elements were needed, cautioning against any assumption that the Kuwaiti order alone would suffice to keep the line running beyond the end of 2017. Howard Berry, Boeing's top international sales executive, last month said the company expected a decision about F/A-18 orders within months from an unnamed Middle Eastern country. Boeing assembles the jets in St. Louis, while weapons maker Northrop Grumman Corp. builds the plane's aft/center fuselage section and vertical tails in El Segundo, California. The new U.S. and Kuwaiti orders would allow production to continue well into 2019, said one of the sources. Boeing officials have previously said they must decide this summer  even before Congress finalizes the fiscal 2016 budget  whether to start shutting down the line or use the company's own funds to buy titanium and other supplies that take a long time to deliver. Final 2016 funding levels remain uncertain. Denmark is also weighing possible orders for Boeing Super Hornets, but that decision is now expected to slip to late 2015 after an election there, according to industry and government sources. Boeing is also vying for orders from Canada, which is expected to announce the results of its fighter competition this fall, as well as Malaysia and Belgium. The company is competing against Lockheed Martin Corp., whose F-35 fighter jet offers more advanced stealth capability, for possible orders in Canada, Denmark and Belgium. Boeing officials argue that the F/A-18 offers countries a low-risk option for renewing their fighter fleets because it is combat-proven and affordable, drawing comparisons to early cost overruns and delays on Lockheed's F-35 fighter jet, which is still completing development. Boeing stepped up its lobbying efforts earlier this year after the Navy added 12 F/A-18s, worth $1.15 billion, to its list of ""unfunded priorities.""

[D-HI]","  Home  | About  | Newsroom  | At Your Service  | Representing Hawai'i's Values  | Contact  May 13, 2015 Aloha, The last few weeks have included several major milestones. The Senate finally confirmed Loretta Lynch as the first female African-American United States Attorney General. The United States Supreme Court also began considering marriage equality. This comes after some progress on equal rights in the Senate, where eleven Republicans joined the Democrats to support my amendment to the budget resolution that would ensure that legally married gay couples have access to the Social Security and veterans' benefits that they have rightfully earned. May is Asian Pacific American Heritage month, and the United States' significant relationship with Japan was reaffirmed by a visit from Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. As always, please contact my office in D.C. or Hawaii if there is anything we can do. We are here to help. Mahalo, Brian Schatz U.S. Senator Ensuring Equal Rights for Same-Sex Spouses During the recent discussions on the Budget Resolution, the Senate voted to pass Senator Schatz's amendment establishing a deficit-neutral reserve fund to ensure all legally married spouses have access to the Social Security and VA benefits their family has earned, including all same-sex couples. In April, the Senate passed unanimously by voice vote Senator Schatz's motion to instruct budget conferees to include this language in their final report. ""This is not an ideological proposal. This is about treating veterans, disabled Americans, and our seniors equally - no matter where they live or what their sexual orientation may be,"" said Senator Schatz. Senator Schatz also spoke on the Senate floor to call for the passage of his motion. ""Three weeks ago, the Senate held an important vote on an amendment to the budget resolution. Fifty-six of my colleagues, including eleven Republicans, joined me in affirming the need for legislation to ensure that all legally married spouses, including gay couples, have access to Social Security and VA benefits that their families have earned. This amendment passed with bipartisan support because it is fundamentally about fairness."" Click here  to read the full text of the remarks. Senator Schatz additionally made the following statement after the U.S. Supreme Court began hearing arguments on same-sex marriage: ""Equality and fairness are basic principles we all can understand. Today, as the Supreme Court begins to hear arguments on marriage equality, I am confident it will rule that marriage equality is a constitutional right. Committed couples, whether they are gay or straight, deserve to be treated equally under the law. The Supreme Court has the opportunity to make history and do what is right."" In March, 2013, Senator Schatz signed an amicus brief to the U.S. Supreme Court, urging that it strike down the discriminatory Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) that barred same-sex marriage. _____ Recognizing the First Woman of Color to Serve as Attorney General Senator Schatz joined many of his colleagues to recognize Loretta Lynch on her historic confirmation as the first African-American woman to be named U.S. Attorney General. The Senate confirmed Lynch on April 23 by a 56-43 vote. _____ Reaffirming the United States-Japan Alliance Senator Schatz welcomed Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe to the U.S. Capitol on Wednesday, April 29 and attended a joint meeting of Congress where the Prime Minister discussed the future of U.S.-Japanese relations. In advance of Prime Minister Abe's address to Congress, Senator Schatz joined Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker (R-Tenn.) and Ranking Member Ben Cardin (D-Md.) in introducing a bipartisan resolution (S.Res.152) on the significance of the United States' relationship with Japan.  Senator Schatz welcomes Japan Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. The resolution ""reaffirms the importance of the United States-Japan alliance for maintaining peace and stability in the Asia-Pacific region and beyond;"" ""promotes deepening the economic and trade ties between the United States and Japan, including the empowerment of women;"" and ""calls for continued cooperation between the Governments of the United States and Japan in the promotion of human rights."" The full text of the resolution is available here  . _____ Celebrating Asian-Pacific American Heritage Month May is Asian-Pacific American Heritage Month. Senator Schatz made the following statement in recognition of the history, contributions and achievements of the Asian American and Pacific Islander Communities: ""During the month of May, we celebrate Asian-Pacific American Heritage Month, recognizing the lasting contributions to our nation made by the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities. We also commemorate the arrival of the first Japanese immigrants to the United States more than 170 years ago. The Asian-Pacific American influence is a part of our daily lives in Hawai'i where its traditions and customs are woven into our culture, cuisine, and commerce. The Hawai'i that we proudly call our home today owes a great legacy to the Ancient Hawaiians who established a vibrant and self-sustaining society in one of the most isolated places in the world. The strong values and numerous accomplishments of Asian-Pacific Americans highlight strength in diversity and inspire community-building throughout our nation."" _____ Meeting with Hawai'i High School Students in D.C.

,114,Male,N00013799,43309,"Forbes, Randy (Rep.) [R-VA4]"," Send me an email | Forward to a Friend Friend  When a crisis arises and American lives and interests are at risk, the first question decision makers ask is, Where are the carriers? Our Navys aircraft carriers provide 4.5 acres of sovereign American territory and a mobile base of operations that reduces the need to deploy U.S. boots on the ground. When ISIS blitzed through the Middle East last year, the strike fighters aboard the carrier George H.W. Bush were the only U.S. aircraft in position and ready to halt their advance. It took 54 days for the United States to negotiate deals with allies in the region that allowed us to employ aircraft based on their territory. In the months since, the carriers Carl Vinson and Theodore Roosevelt have rotated through the region, providing a constant American military presence, supporting ongoing operations against ISIS, and deterring aggression by Iran. In other theaters, meanwhile, the presence of American carriers has deterred aggression, protected the free flow of goods, people, and information, and enabled the United States to extend a helping hand when natural disasters strike. To maintain this critical presence, America needs a fleet of at least 11 carriers. This is not just some congressionally-mandated levelit is the number of carriers the Navy has said it needs to conduct current and future operations under our national security strategy. As the Secretary of the Navy, Ray Mabus, said in March 2015, Carrier force structure below 11 would inject significant risk in the Fleets ability to comply with the Defense Strategic Guidance. Indeed, demand for aircraft carriers has been exceeding supply for years. As a result, carrier deployments have increased in length from 5.5 months on average in 2008 to 9.5 months for Carl Vinson in 2014-2015. This directly impacts the sailors who operate these important ships and their families. Rear Admiral Thomas Moore arguably put it best when he said, We're an 11-carrier Navy in a 15-carrier world. Reducing carrier requirements will have serious consequences for our Navy. In May 2014, Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Greenert said, When I look out into the future, we need at least 11 carriers. That includes preserving the presence of today, the ability to react, be where it matters, when it matters. Because the demand for carrier presence and capabilities is not expected to decrease in the near term, reducing our carrier requirement and the size of our carrier fleet will not translate into savings or flexibility. In fact, arbitrarily reducing our carrier fleet to 10 ships would place a larger burden on the remaining force and our military personnel by increasing the length of deployments, reducing our ships and sailors time at home, increasing the stress on our ships and the amount of maintenance they require, and increasing the stress on sailors and their families, potentially motivating them to leave the service. An 11-carrier fleet is what our Navy and our Nation need. Thats why I am opposing an amendment to the national defense policy bill that would expose these valuable strategic assets to budget cuts, and could undermine Americas ability to respond to crises and deter conflict around the world. I will keep you updated on the fight. Yours in service, Randy Home | Contact | Forward to a Friend | Unsubscribe | Subscribe | Privacy | Office Locations Please do not reply to this message.

Miller on GMs $1 Billion Investment in its Warren Tech Center General Motors announces $1 billion improvement and expansion project at its Warren Tech Center expected to create 2,600 jobs Washington  Today, U.S. Representative Candice Miller (MI-10) issued the following statement after General Motors Co. announced plans to invest $1 billion for a project to modernize and expand its Warren Tech Center, a project expected to last through 2018 and create an estimated 2,600 new jobs: Six years ago, our nation was debating whether it was in our national interest to provide bridge loans to our domestic auto industry and iconic companies like General Motors to help them through the economic meltdown that threatened their existence. Providing those loans was absolutely the right path forward, because, today, all of those loans have been repaid, and our domestic auto industry is thriving due to their tremendously talented and skilled workforce and the incredible products in the marketplace. Todays announcement by General Motors that they are investing $1 billion to expand and upgrade the GM Tech Center in Warren, a project that will add 2,600 new jobs and create an innovation center to drive the industry toward a brighter future, is further evidence that providing the bridge loans was the right thing to do. This announcement is great news for Macomb County  the southeast Michigan manufacturing base  and for America as our domestic automotive industry is a principle driver for both our state and national economy. ###   CONNECT WITH US     Washington D.C.

The Congressman is a co-sponsor of this legislation designed tooutlaw abortions at 20 weeks post-fertilization or later, protecting babies from severe pain leading to death.Fetal pain legislation is based on a growing body of irrefutable scientific data and physical evidence of fetal pain. *Please click HERE [link 2]****to listen to the interview* *More information on the Pain-Capable Act* *Protecting unborn babies from painful late abortions* In cases of excepted abortions, this bill requires abortionists to use the means most likely to result in the live birth of the child. A second physician trained in fetal resuscitation is required to be present and to care for babies born alive, and to transport them to hospitals for medical care. *Scientific Evidence* Scientific evidence reveals that unborn babies can feel pain by 20 weeks post-fertilization, and likely, even earlier. By that point, unborn babies have all of the anatomy in place to feel pain.   *Anniversary of Gosnell conviction* This week marks the two-year anniversary of the conviction of late-term abortionist Kermit Gosnell Gosnells illegal, unsafe and gruesome abortion practices resulted in his conviction *Exceptions and reporting requirements* The bill contains an exception for cases in which the life of the mother is at risk, and in cases in which the pregnancy is the result of rape or incest with a minor. This bill does not mandate a report to law enforcement*.*Instead, the bill empowers and cares for women who are victims of rape by requiring counseling or medical care from a non-abortion facility at least 48 hours prior to the abortion procedure. Minors who are victims of rape or incest are protected by requiring the abortionist to inform social services *or *law enforcement in order to guard against potential ongoing abuse of girls. The bill upholds state reporting requirements. *Punishes abortionists, not mothers* The bill punishes abortionists who knowingly perform an abortion after 20 weeks post-fertilization with up to five years in jail. The bill explicitly protects a woman who has an abortion from any prosecution, and gives her (or parents of a minor) a private right of action to seek relief if the abortionist violates this bill. Abortionists have to provide an annual report to the National Center for Health Statistics, under the CDC, with details on all excepted abortions performed. This will be released by the CDC as a public report annually.    *Interesting Articles and Recommended Reading* Royal Gorge Bridge rises from the ashes of 2013 fire [link 3]byThe Mountain Mail **article features Congressman Lamborn** Community, dignitaries celebrate grand re-opening [link 4] of Royal Gorge Bridge & ParkbyThe Canon City Daily Record **article features Congressman Lamborn** Five ways Washington can help bring peace [link 5]byCongressman Doug Lamborn The Threat to Melt the Electric Grid [link 6]by the Wall Street Journal Obama's Nixon Doctrine: Anointing Iran [link 7] by Charles Krauthammer   *Social Media Update* * [image = If you would like to follow me on twitter please find me at @RepDLamborn [link 8] [image = Tweet 1.jpg] [image = Tweet 2.jpg] [image = Tweet 3.jpg] [image = Tweet 4.jpg]    [image =  *Onmy Facebook [link 9]this weekconstituents commented on participating in the National Day of Prayer:*  **Cheryl Dingwell-Keckritz***- **Absolutely.* **Mai Bee *-**Gladly!

This week, I honored our public service heroes by observing National Police Week. I am grateful for their service and sacrifice every single day. As we take a moment to thank the men and women in blue, I want to again thank my friend Stafford Police Officer, mom and former Marine Ann Carrizales for her decision to protect and serve the folks in Stafford, Texas. While on duty in 2013, Officer Carrizales was in pursuit of a suspect and was shot in the face.  She called in her injury and still managed to chase and subdue the suspect. Never underestimate a mother's will to come home to her kids. On behalf of Officer Carrizales and all of our brave men and women in blue - thank you.  Officer Ann Carrizales, Rep. Olson and her family in Sugar Land, TX In honor of National Police Week, the House passed legislation to give our local heroes the support they deserve. H.R. 606 - Don't Tax Our Fallen Public Safety Heroes Act  Passed the House by voice vote This bill amends the Internal Revenue Service (IRS) tax code to exclude fallen service member benefits from being considered taxable income. It ensures that families of fallen officers receive the benefits they are promised, without the fear of unfair taxes. H.R.2146 - Defending Public Safety Employees' Retirement Act  Passed the House by voice vote This bill expands the IRS tax code to exempt law enforcement officials from a 10% penalty tax when collecting early retirement. H.R. 723 - Fallen Heroes Flag Act of 2015  Passed the House by voice vote This bill simply allows Representatives to provide the families of fallen heroes with an American flag flown over the Capitol in remembrance of their loved one. S. 665 - Rafael Ramos and Wenjian Liu National Blue Alert Act of 2015  Passed the House by voice vote This bill requires the Department of Justice to create a national communication network, Blue Alert, to quickly provide information in the event an officer is hurt in the line of duty. Our communities are stronger thanks to the officers who protect and serve. As we take this National Police Week opportunity to honor these every day heroes, I hope you will join me in saying thank you to the men and women in blue. I'm honored to represent you in Congress.

,114,Male,N00031938,43550,"Amash, Justin (Rep.) [R-MI3]","  ABOUT ME  CONTACT ME  SERVING YOU  MEDIA CENTER  LEGISLATIVE WORK  OUR DISTRICT  RESOURCES  Sign up to receive email updates   Friends, On Wednesday, H.R. 2048, the USA FREEDOM Act of 2015, passed the House of Representatives 338-88. The bill expressly authorizes, for the first time, the NSA, FBI, and other government agencies to unconstitutionally collect data in bulk on potentially millions of law-abiding Americans. Here's my full statement from Wednesday on why I voted no on the USA FREEDOM Act: Last week, the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ruled that the bulk telephone metadata program run by the National Security Agency (NSA) is not authorized by Section 215 of the Patriot Act and is thus unlawful. The ruling is a big win for privacy and civil liberties advocates who have long argued that Section 215 clearly does not contemplate the type of mass collection we now know is occurring. But the win will be short-lived if H.R. 2048, the latest version of the USA FREEDOM Act thats scheduled to be considered by the House of Representatives this afternoon, becomes law. Section 215 authorizes the government to collect records and other ""tangible things"" that are ""relevant"" to a terrorism or foreign intelligence investigation. To support the bulk collection of data pertaining to millions of law-abiding Americans, the government has effectively claimed that all records everywhere are potentially relevant to a current or future investigation, and thus all records are fair game for collection. In its ruling, the Second Circuit had little choice but to reject the government's broad interpretation of ""relevant,"" given that the rest of the statute gives no indication Congress ever contemplated collection on such a mass scale. So far, so good. But H.R. 2048 threatens to undo much of the progress resulting from the Second Circuit's opinion. The bill's sponsors, and unfortunately some outside advocacy groups, wrongly claim that H.R. 2048 ends ""bulk"" collection. It's true that the bill ends the phone dragnet as we currently know it--by having the phone companies themselves hold, search, and analyze certain data at the request of the government, which is worse in many ways given the broader set of data the companies hold--but H.R. 2048 actually expands the statutory basis for the large-scale collection of most data. H.R. 2048 does this by authorizing the government to order the production of records based upon a ""specific selection term"" (i.e., like a search term used in a search engine). The records sought still must be relevant to an investigation, so its possible the courts ruling will continue to restrain the government in some fashion. But its more likely a court looking at H.R. 2048's language will see the ""specific selection term"" as defining the outer limits of what Congress considers acceptably ""relevant"" under Section 215. Indeed, the Second Circuit encouraged Congress in reforming Section 215 to make a congressional judgment as to what is 'reasonable' under current circumstances. Unfortunately, specific selection term is defined so broadly under the bill as to have little effect on narrowing the scope of items the government may obtain through a 215 order. A ""specific selection term"" may be a specific person (including a corporation, such as Western Union), account, address, or personal device, but it also may be ""any other specific identifier,"" and the bill expressly contemplates using geographic regions or communication service providers (such as Verizon) to define the records sought, so long as it's not the only identifier used as part of the specific selection term. In other words, the bill doesn't let the government require Verizon to turn over all its records without limitation, but nothing appears to prevent the government from requiring Verizon to turn over all its records for all its customers in the state of New York. Only a politician or bureaucrat wouldn't call that ""bulk."" H.R. 2048 gives our intelligence agencies, for the first time, statutory authority to collect Americans data in bulk. In light of the Second Circuit's opinion that the NSA has been collecting our information in bulk without statutory authority for all this time, it would be a devastating misstep for Congress to pass a bill that codifies that bulk collection and likely ensures no future court will ever again be positioned to rule against the government for over-collecting on statutory grounds. H.R. 2048 falls woefully short of reining in the mass collection of Americans' data, and it takes us a step in the wrong direction by specifically authorizing such collection in violation of the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution. Americans, and members of Congress, should demand that Congress instead pass the original, bipartisan version of the USA FREEDOM Act from 2013, which strengthened--not weakened--Section 215's relevance standard to end bulk collection, while still allowing the government the flexibility it needs to pursue genuine threats against the United States. Section 215 expires on June 1, 2015. I will spend the next few weeks working to ensure Congress does not enact legislation to extend Section 215 unless accompanied by significant reforms that end bulk collection, comply with the Constitution, and fully protect your rights.

[R-IA3]","News from Iowa Congressman David Young  Home  About Me  Media Center  Services  Contact  Friends, This week was National Small Business Week and I used this opportunity to visit with small businesses in Iowa's Third Congressional District. Truth be told, every week should be small business week, because they are really the life blood of our towns and cities.  WHERE I WENT... I held a Small Business Roundtable in the East Village of Des Moines. Nearly 20 small business owners gathered to tell me what is working and what is not working for their businesses.  My visit to shops in Emerson, Mills County, was cut short by rain, so we went to the Emerson Community Center to talk about the challenges folks on Main Street are facing.  I visited stores in Adel, Dallas County, to hear what small business owners are talking about.  I toured Katecho, Inc. in Des Moines, and learned about the challenges that the company faces when the federal government gets in the way.   WHAT I LEARNED...  I heard a reoccurring message all across southwest and central Iowa this past week. Iowa job creators want a level playing field and they want certainty. They want certainty in the tax code by making it permanent. They want a dose of Iowa commonsense and reality when it comes to the seemingly endless stream of rules and regulations that can strangle job creation and growth. Representing you in Washington is an honor and a privilege - one that I take very seriously. I could not do it without you. Enjoy the rest of your weekend, I hope to see you soon!

,114,Male,N00000743,43312,"Garrett, Scott (Rep.) [R-NJ5]","Dear Friend, As one of the most densely populated states in the entire country, New Jersey has its share of transportation problems. Our roads and infrastructure are vital to our lives and livelihoods, and can be a constant source of frustration for many people. Being startled after hitting a pothole or seeing a lane closure ruin your morning commute by clogging-up traffic is practically a rite of passage in the Garden State. Our transportation needs are unique and they require unique solutions. By and large, our highway projects and road maintenance costs are paid by federal and state gas taxes. These taxes combine for a set amount built into the price of every gallon of fuel that motorists purchase. New Jerseyans pay a 14.5 cent state tax plus an 18.4 cent federal tax, which totals 32.9 cents per gallon every time you fill-up. The federal gas tax revenue is placed in the Highway Trust Fund (HTF) and, for almost 60 years, the HTF held enough revenue to support highway projects in every state. But, in 2008, the HTF became insolvent. Since then, American taxpayers have bailed out the HTF six times, costing you almost $62 billion. The national highway system was built on the user-pays principlethose that used the roads would pay to maintain them through the gas tax. While many factors have contributed to the HTFs funding shortfall, a major culprit is Congress diverting gas tax funds that should have been spent on the maintenance of our highways and transportation infrastructure. Instead, taxpayer funds have been funneled to projects that have nothing to do with highways or infrastructure like pedestrian paths, landscaping, university research, and hiking trails. As Congress debates another bailout of the Highway Trust Fund later this month, I want to take this issue directly to you, my constituents who use our roads every day. After all, you know the condition of Kinderkamack Road in Emerson, the traffic on Route 4 in Hackensack, and the projects needed on Water Street in Belvidere better than anyone in D.C.

While we honor our fallen heroes, we also renew our commitment to all men and women in uniform every day. It is our duty as a nation to ensure that our servicemembers and veterans receive the benefits theyve earned, and that their voices are heard. Last week, I traveled across the central and northwest Connecticut to learn directly from veterans about the issues that are important to them.  With veterans who are enrolled at Western Connecticut State University On Monday, I attended a roundtable discussion with veterans and advocates to hear about how the federal government can better address military sexual trauma. According to the Department of Veterans Affairs, 1 in 4 female and 1 in 100 male veterans report having experienced military sexual traumaand thats just the number who have come forward to seek assistance. At an event in Simsbury  , I heard from veterans about the critical support family caregivers provide. In 2010, Congress recognized the importance of caregiver support services for veterans when it created the VA Program of Comprehensive Assistance for Family Caregivers. However, only veterans who have served after September 11, 2001 are eligible for this benefit. Im working on legislation to change that, because these essential programs should be available for veterans of every service eras by broadening eligibility to cover all veterans. On Friday, I met with veterans at Naugatuck Valley Community College in Waterbury to discuss the consequences of exposure to burn pits  while serving in Iraq and Afghanistan. The military regularly uses burn pits to incinerate waste  batteries, pesticides, tires, human waste, asbestos, even munitions  releasing dangerous toxic smoke across the base. I was inspired to introduce legislation, the Helping Veterans Exposed to Burn Pits Act, H.R. 2237  , after veterans from across northwest and central Connecticut informed me of the negative health effects they suffered. Its truly an honor to assist our veterans with problems that theyre having with the Department of Veterans Affairs and other federal agencies. Recently, I helped a student veteran from Brookfield solve a problem with his VA education benefits, clearing nearly $27,000 in debt. You can read more here  . As always, please do not hesitate to reach out with your questions, concerns, or if theres anything I can do to help you and your family. I can only do my job effectively if I hear from you.

,114,Male,N00028133,43443,"Lamborn, Doug (Rep.) [R-CO5]","U.S. Congressman Doug Lamborn, Colorado's 5th Congressional District *The Hill Op-Ed: Time to get serious about space threats* 5/14/15 By Congressman Doug Lamborn 62 miles above the Earth's surface is the beginning of space. It would be nice to believe that space is a place of peace and science, but it is all too clear that at least two of our potential adversaries are weaponizing space. The United States must take these threats seriously and respond accordingly in order to defend ourselves and our allies while deterring potential adversaries from acting irresponsibly in space.   Both China and Russia have openly admitted that they have or are developing counter-space capabilities. These capabilities could range from jamming of GPS signals and satellite communications, to blinding or damaging our satellites with ground-based lasers, to destroying a satellite with a missile. China has in fact tested anti-satellite missiles at least twice in the past two years. Russia, meanwhile, has launched an undeclared object into space which our military now believes to be some sort of microsatellite. We do not know Russias intentions, but an object like this could be used to jam or directly attack our satellites.   These public facts, combined with multiple statements from the administration, paint a clear picture of the serious military threats we face in space. As Lt. Gen. John Raymond, commander of U.S. space forces, recently put it, We are quickly approaching the point where every satellite in every orbit can be threatened.  In some ways, the United States is a victim of our own success in space. We can put a bomb through a specific window in a specific building thanks to GPS. We can remotely pilot aircraft on the other side of the world and can detect ballistic missile launches anywhere on the globe thanks to our robust network of satellites. Our adversaries have seen what a significant advantage space provides the U.S. and have responded by looking for ways to neutralize or destroy our space capabilities. The U.S. is in the unique position of having the most to gain and most to lose in space.  While the United States clearly faces a national security threat in space, the economic consequences of irresponsible actions in space are also very significant. According to the non-profit Space Foundation, the global space economy was over $330 billion in 2014, only a quarter of which is due to spending by any government worldwide. Reckless actions in space, like Chinas 2007 anti-satellite missile test, put commercial and government space assets at risk by generating deadly debris fields. While Sandra Bullock and George Clooney took a bit of creative license in Gravity, the threat of space debris is all too real. Chinas 2007 test alone created roughly 3,000 pieces of space debris, which satellites and even the International Space Station now have to maneuver around. Just one small piece of debris, traveling at thousands of miles per hour, can damage or destroy anything in space.  How do we prevent reckless actions in space, or even worse, a war in space? Our best option is to deter bad actions. Deterrence in space is complicated and multifaceted, but at a minimum we must do two things. First, we need to make sure that our ability to fight and win is not contingent on a few specific weak points. This means developing space capabilities that are harder to jam or destroy and, to some extent, can be replaced quickly and cheaply. This also means making sure that our forces can operate in environments where space assets might not be available. Today our military enjoys uncontested access to space assets, but that will not be the case in the future.   Secondly, we must be prepared to defend our space assets from attack. We must make it clear to potential adversaries that an attack on our space assets will be treated as seriously as an attack against our terrestrial assets. Different threats will require different types of defenses, and we must create credible options to face the full range of threats, including active defenses. The simple truth is that our potential adversaries have already weaponized space. If we dont allow ourselves to take defensive measures, conflict in space is actually more likely. Ronald Reagans maxim is true in space as it is on earth: peace through strength.  The good news is that the Department of Defense is taking steps to respond to the increasing threats in space. General John Hyten, the head of Air Force Space Command, is one of those leading the efforts to secure our place in space. Bob Work, the deputy secretary of Defense, recently highlighted this need, and Admiral Cecil Haney, the head of Strategic Command, recently announced that the Department of Defense will be spending an additional $5 billion over the next five years to strengthen our security in space.   In Congress, as we consider the annual National Defense Authorization Act, we are supporting the additional funding, but also taking important steps to prioritize national security space. We have language to establish a major force program for space, similar to budget authority and requirements that Special Operations Command currently has. This will prioritize space funding as well as enable better coordination and oversight of the space budget, helping us ensure that every dollar dedicated to space security is well spent. There are also many other facets of space security where Congress and the Pentagon are working together.   The bottom line is that our potential adversaries are weaponizing space. The United States and our allies face serious and credible threats against our space capabilities. If we do not respond to these threats, the likelihood of an attack in space will only go up. We must instead deter any dangerous actions in space by strengthening our space systems and making it very clear we will defend our space assets. If we want to keep space safe and secure for all responsible parties, we must be prepared to defend our space systems and defeat any efforts to attack them. Anything less represents failure in the final frontier. ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- Contact Information: Website: WASHINGTON OFFICE 2402 Rayburn HOB Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-4422 Fax: (202) 226-2638 DISTRICT OFFICE 1271 Kelly Johnson Blvd. Suite 110 Colorado Springs, CO 80920 Phone: (719) 520-0055 Fax: (719) 520-0840 DISTRICT OFFICE 415 Main Street Buena Vista, CO 81211 Phone: (719) 520-0055 Fax: (719) 520-0840 Privacy Policy: Unsubscribe: ",2015-01-06,5,Rep.,Representative,true,CO,doug.lamborn@houseenews.net,05/14/2015,Republican,2698,,http://lamborn.house.gov,Representative for Colorado's 5th congressional district,Doug,RepDLamborn,,Lamborn,L000564,202-225-4422,1954-05-24,https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/doug_lamborn/412191,CongressmanLamborn,,representative,1022846,Representative,2017-01-03,Rep.

Last week, I held four public listening sessions throughout western and central Wisconsin to hear your questions and concerns. Every year, I visit each of the 19 counties in the 3rd Congressional District to talk directly with our neighbors. For more information, please visit my website by clicking here [link 1]. Below are some of the important issues I've been working on recently. *Raise the Wage* For far too long, many hard-working men and women have not been earning livable or sustainable wages. The $7.25 an hour minimum wage set in 2009 has failed to keep up with inflation, decreasing the purchasing power of those Americans living on minimum wage. Thats why I was proud to cosponsor the Raise the Wage Act, H.R. 2150. This bill would help those living on a minimum wage income deal with the rising cost of living and inflation. We must ensure that workers in America receive a fair days pay for doing a fair days work. *Medicaid Expansion* I recently conducted a survey that studied public opinion about federal support to expand Medicaid in Wisconsin. The survey results were clear: over 82% of respondents agreed that Medicaid expansion is good for Wisconsin. Click here [link 2] to read the survey report. Wisconsin taxpayers are paying for expanded Medicaid in states throughout the nation, but those taxes are not coming back to benefit Wisconsin. According to the nonpartisan Legislative Fiscal Bureau, an estimated 152,000 Wisconsinites would qualify for Medicaid if Governor Walker accepts the federal funding. I urge Governor Walker to follow the lead of other Republican Governors around the country and accept Medicaid expansion. *Tomah VA* The allegations being made at the Tomah VA are extremely serious. Last week, I attended a veterans town hall at the Tomah VA hosted by Dr. Carolyn Clancy, VA Interim Under Secretary for Health. The town hall provided an important opportunity for dialogue between VA leadership, veterans and their family members. As the investigations continue, we owe it to our veterans to do everything we can to fix the problems that have occurred at the VA to ensure that they receive the care and treatment that they deserve. That's why I recently led the Wisconsin House delegation in introducing the bipartisan Inspectors General Transparency Act, which would ensure that all Office of Inspector General (OIG) reports are published on the OIG website and submitted to Congress. We must get to the bottom of the problems at the VA, and fix what needs to be fixed. This is my top priority.

Hi All! I hope you are all having a terrific week and enjoying the spring weather. Last week, I travelled around the district to meet with constituents and discuss some of the biggest issues facing Granite Staters. I co-hosted a mental health summit with Congressman Guinta in Concord, met with community leaders in Claremont to discuss the economic importance of passenger rail, and held a discussion on advanced manufacturing in Keene. I also announced my bill to fight carbon monoxide poisoning at the Hudson Fire Department and met with advocates and residents in Lebanon to talk about affordable housing in the Upper Valley.  Addressing Mental Health Issues with Congressman Guinta As New Hampshire struggles to address a number of mental health issues, I joined Congressman Frank Guinta to host a mental health summit in Concord to hear directly from local stakeholders in New Hampshire about how best to increase access to mental health care for those in need. It's long past time to remove the stigma around mental health and ensure that high quality care is offered in the Granite State and beyond, and I'm proud to join with Congressman Guinta in drafting legislation to improve mental health services across the nation. The summit gave us a chance to receive feedback on our legislation from those in the community who are working on these issues every day in New Hampshire, and we look forward to incorporating their thoughts in our bill as we prepare to introduce the legislation in the House. (Read more here  )  Talking with Community Leaders about Passenger Rail in Claremont A robust transportation infrastructure is critical for New Hampshire to thrive in the global 21st century economy, and I was thrilled to host a roundtable in Claremont to discuss the economic importance of passenger rail in Sullivan County and throughout New Hampshire. The roundtable gave me a chance to hear from business and community leaders about the importance of passenger rail to economic development in Claremont and the surrounding communities. I have been a vocal advocate for improving our infrastructure, and I look forward to working together with local leaders to strengthen our roads, bridges, and railways so we can meet the needs of residents, businesses, and tourists. (Read more here  )  Advocating for Advanced Manufacturing in Keene I had the opportunity to hear from students and industry leaders during a manufacturing summit I hosted at the Regional Center for Advanced Manufacturing (RCAM) in Keene. I have made supporting job creation and helping our small businesses grow one of my top priorities in Congress, and advanced manufacturing is an important piece of the Granite State's economic future. This summit also helped connect industry leaders and aspiring entrepreneurs with resources in the Monadnock Region. I have been a strong supporter of advanced manufacturing in the Granite State, and it was great to hear directly from students and business leaders so that I can continue to go to bat for them on the federal level. Combating Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Last week, I joined with New Hampshire Fire Marshal J. William Degnan and fire officials from Hudson and Nashua to announce the reintroduction of my bill, the Carbon Monoxide Poisoning Prevention Act. I'm proud to sponsor this legislation, which would help protect New Hampshire families from the grave dangers of carbon monoxide poisoning. Carbon monoxide poisoning is the leading cause of accidental poisoning death in the United States, and is a particular concern in cold-weather states like New Hampshire. We must ensure that families have the resources they need to heat their homes safely and without incident, and this bill will go a long way toward that goal.  Fighting for Affordable Housing in the Upper Valley In Lebanon, I brought together stakeholders, affordable housing advocates, and community members to discuss New Hampshire's housing needs. I've long called on my colleagues in Congress to preserve crucial funding for affordable housing, and this roundtable underscored the urgent need for increased investment in these programs now. The stories I heard during this roundtable truly illustrated how affordable housing units across the Granite State can help our hardworking families get ahead. But without federal funds many of these programs are threatened and these families' livelihoods are put in jeopardy.  I will continue to work with the USDA to encourage expansion of rural development programs that are particularly important in communities like those located in the Upper Valley, and I urge my colleagues in Congress to come together and support federal affordable housing programs across the board.

,114,Male,N00028133,43443,"Lamborn, Doug (Rep.) [R-CO5]","U.S. Congressman Doug Lamborn, Colorado's 5th Congressional District *Addressing the Annual Missile Defense Forum* 5/14/15 This week, Congressman Doug Lamborn delivered a keynote address at the 13th Annual Ronald Reagan Missile Defense Forum. [image = MDA 1.JPG] [image = MDA 3.JPG] *Text of Speech* Good morning. Thank you first and foremost to Admiral Syring for the invitation to speak this morning. As you all know, Admiral Syring is a huge asset for the Missile Defense Agency. His leadership has been vital as the MDA has faced challenging budget environments. Admiral Syring is very well respected on Capitol Hill and I am grateful for all the time he has given me, both here in Washington and at the Missile Defense Integration and Operations Center, or MDIOC, in my district just outside Colorado Springs. Speaking of Colorado Springs, Im sure there are a few folks in industry and government here today from Colorado Springs. Im extremely proud of the contribution that my constituents make to missile defense system, which is part of why I co-chair the Missile Defense Caucus. In fact, just three weeks ago, we hosted a number of industry partners for the second Missile Defense Day on the Hill. Unfortunately, the Speaker cut votes short for the week, so we didnt get as many members of Congress as last time, but it was still a great day. And thank you Admiral Syring for letting General Todorov come to that event. His participation was a great addition. Were obviously here today to talk about the importance of missile defense. Or more specifically, the importance of a strong and reliable missile defense system. The fact that we can hit a bullet with a bullet is stunning, but it doesnt do much good if it isnt a part of a system that provides reliable protection to the homeland. The good news is that we have a reliable system today and each day it is getting more reliable, thanks to the work of many of you in this room. In addition to protecting American citizens 24 hours a day, 365 days a year, this missile defense system actually changes how our potential adversaries think -- and in a good way. A credible missile defense system reduces the value of long-range ballistic missiles to rogue regimes. And most importantly it prevents America from ever being held hostage by threats from rogue regimes. Missile defense actually changes the strategic environment for the better. Now missile defense has not always been a bipartisan issue. As many of you well know, there have been critics of missile defense for decades, but there is now strong bipartisan support in Congress for missile defense. Yes, there are still occasional detractors and yes, there are still some areas of missile defense where partisan lines emerge, but by and large there is consensus that missile defense is important. Part of this consensus is that missile defense has proven itself. The most high profile example is obviously Iron Dome. And while that is different in many important ways from what you all spend most of your time working on, I think it unmistakably showed the real-world value of missile defenses. If you can shoot down a rocket or a missile headed for your country, your political leaders have more space to make decisions in responding to the attack. But Im preaching to the choir on this, so let me move on. Let me offer a few ideas of where I think we need to take our missile defense system. First, we need to continue investing in our current system to make sure it is robust and reliable. Just a few miles from my house is NORTHCOM. Admiral Gortney and his team, through the Colorado National Guardsmen at the 100th Missile Defense Brigade--they are the warfighters. They need a robust and reliable system that is ready to go on a moments notice. We must continue improving our ground-based interceptors. I am glad to see the CE2 interceptors being deployed, and Im glad that our plans to put more GBIs in the ground in Alaska seem to be on track. We also need to ensure that the backbone of BMDS is strong and secure. The sensors and command & control architecture needs to provide warfighters and decision makers with what they need quickly and reliably. To ensure all of this, I believe that we need more testing. We need more ground testing, we need more flight testing, we need more exercising, and so on. I know this costs money, but testing is critical if we want to have a reliable system. Second, we need to improve our sensor architecture. Our interceptors are only as good as the sensors that guide them. The Long Range Discriminating Radar (or LRDR) in Alaska will play a key part in this. I know that Admiral Syring and Admiral Gortney are talking about the best place to put this radar, and I am very supportive of this going forward. But we also need to look at other sensors as well, and we need to make sure that we can use existing sensor data well. This leads me to my third area where we need to invest--space. I believe that space-based sensors, and perhaps more than sensors in the future, are key to the future of missile defense. We obviously already rely on space for missile warning, but we should do more. The Space Tracking and Surveillance System (STSS) demonstration has proven itself to be very effective. If you arent familiar with what theyve been able to do with just two satellites, you should go learn about it. It is clear that some sort of space sensor layer could provide critical track and discrimination ability. In fact, the National Defense Authorization Act that will be on the floor of the House later today, includes a provision I added encouraging the MDA to move forward on developing a space sensor architecture. As you may know, the MDA actually has a very exciting space program underway right now that has a great acronym: SKA. Its the Space-based Kill Assessment. I cant say too much about it in this venue, except that the team at MDAs space unit are doing great work, and may actually be showing the rest of the DOD how to think creatively and affordably about space systems. The fourth area is kind of an obvious catchall, but must be discussed. We need to continue to invest in advanced technologies. We can hit a bullet with a bullet, but we cant be content there. We need to bend the cost curve, and we need to change when and where we can intercept missiles. I also happen to co-chair the Directed Energy Caucus, and I think directed energy is crucial to the future of missile defense. MDA has some directed energy work currently, and more proposed in FY16, but myself and others in Congress believe we must prioritize our investments in directed energy if we want to stay ahead of the competition and bend the cost curve. Directed energy can be used as a sensor, but also hopefully, eventually, as a means of intercept. Other emerging technologies also need to be invested in, such as railgun. Underlying all of these areas of focus is one obvious need: increased funding. The increases this year for ground-based missile defense are good, but far from sufficient. The Budget Control Act is partly to blame, as it imposed the spending caps and sequestration. I voted against that deal and I am actively advocating in Congress to get rid of it. But this is only one part of the missile defense funding challenge. The other part, frankly, seems to be the priorities of this administration. This administration has been consistently whittling away at the missile defense budget. After then-Secretary of Defense Chuck Hagel announced the increased number of GBIs in Alaska, the next budget request actually was lower for missile defense. The pace and seriousness of the threat seems to have brought increased policy support for missile defense, but the funding is still below what it ought to be. This year the Presidents budget request went up by roughly $600 million, but it is still $1.2 billion below the last year of the Bush Administration. And the out-years for this years budget request would cut missile defense funding to a record low even for this administration. So, Im obviously concerned about missile defense funding. Yes, we need to address the budget caps and sequestration, but this is primarily a question of priority of this administration. We are entering a new missile age and robust missile defenses are a must. Missile defense is vitally important and is a mission that cannot fail. I will continue to work with my colleagues in Congress to promote a strong level of funding for missile defense and I hope that the administration will promote a strong funding level for missile defense as well.  ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- Contact Information: Website: WASHINGTON OFFICE 2402 Rayburn HOB Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-4422 Fax: (202) 226-2638 DISTRICT OFFICE 1271 Kelly Johnson Blvd. Suite 110 Colorado Springs, CO 80920 Phone: (719) 520-0055 Fax: (719) 520-0840 DISTRICT OFFICE 415 Main Street Buena Vista, CO 81211 Phone: (719) 520-0055 Fax: (719) 520-0840 Privacy Policy: Unsubscribe: ",2015-01-06,5,Rep.,Representative,true,CO,doug.lamborn@houseenews.net,05/14/2015,Republican,2698,,http://lamborn.house.gov,Representative for Colorado's 5th congressional district,Doug,RepDLamborn,,Lamborn,L000564,202-225-4422,1954-05-24,https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/doug_lamborn/412191,CongressmanLamborn,,representative,1022846,Representative,2017-01-03,Rep.

Dear Friend, I wanted to share a new op-ed  I wrote with my colleague Chris Smith (R - N.J.) outlining our requirements for including Vietnam in the multi-national free trade deal known as the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). As many of you know, San Jose has a strong and vibrant Vietnamese-American community. I frequently hear from my constituents who are concerned with the lack of human rights and basic democratic principles  in Vietnam. I've heard many times from friends and family members of Vietnamese citizens who have been wrongfully imprisoned in Vietnam because they spoke out for better working conditions, or simply the right to freely exercise their religion. When I traveled to Vietnam earlier this year  I passed their message along: that political rights, religious freedoms, and human dignity should not be suppressed. That's why, as TPP negotiations continue, I've made it a top priority of mine to fight for enforceable and binding provisions to meet International Labor Organization standards and to improve human rights and Internet freedom in Vietnam.  I've made it clear to the President and leadership in Congress that they must support these measures if the United States truly wishes to promote human rights, transparency, openness and freedom around the world. I hope you take the time to read this op-ed today  , and share it with others in the community who care about improving freedom, openness and human rights around the world.

[R-VA4]","Friend  Today, I spoke on the House Floor in defense of the legal requirement for our Navy to maintain at least 11 aircraft carriers in its fleet. This number is not arbitraryit is the number of carriers the Navy needs to maintain a global presence and conduct current and future operations under our national security strategy. Reducing our carrier fleet to 10 ships would place a larger burden on the remaining force and on our military personnel by increasing the length of deployments, reducing our ships and sailors time at home, and increasing the stress on our ships and the stress on sailors and their families. In addition, it would deny the United States the floating base of operations we need to rapidly respond to crises and protect American lives and interests overseas. Rear Admiral Thomas Moore arguably put it best when he said, We're an 11-carrier Navy in a 15-carrier world. Reducing the statutory requirement for carriers would mean accepting risks to our men and women in uniform, our national security, and our future military readiness that I am not willing to take.

[R-CO5]","U.S. Congressman Doug Lamborn, Colorado's 5th Congressional District *Supporting Congressional Review of an Iranian Nuclear Deal* 5/14/15 Today, Congressman Doug Lamborn supported H.R. 1191, theIran Nuclear Agreement Review Act of 2015. This bill requires a review by the House and Senate of any nuclear agreement with Iran before President Obama can waive or suspend sanctions previously imposed by Congress. *""President Obama and Secretary of State John Kerry have stumbled through months of negotiations that don't appear to have limited Iran's march toward a nuclear weapon. By mandating Congressional oversight and involvement, H.R. 1191 ensures that this nuclear deal will receive the closest possible scrutiny and will open the door to a more active participatory role for the Congress. Although is only a baby step in the right direction, it does make some progress that is worth supporting. When we are dealing with something that could fundamentally change the balance of power in the Middle East, we cannot afford to rush through any agreement without proper Congressional oversight and due diligence.*  *Passage of this legislation is a major victory for the American people and for the safety and security of this nation and our allies, but it is only the first step. If a deal is reached Congress must work together to insure that it is in fact a good deal. And, if not, Congress must do its role and disapprove of such a deal.""*  - Congressman Doug Lamborn (CO-05) *More Information (courtesy of the House Republican Conference)* Major provisions of the bill include:  Congressional Review: Requires the President to submit to Congress, within five days of concluding a comprehensive agreement with Iran: (1) the text of the agreement and all related materials; (2) a verification assessment on Iranian compliance; and (3) a certification that the agreement meets U.S. non-proliferation objectives and does not jeopardize U.S. national security, including not allowing Iran to pursue nuclear-related military activities.  No Suspension of Congressional Sanctions during Review Period: Prohibits the President from waiving statutory sanctions while Congress reviews the agreement. If the agreement and all related documents are submitted prior to July 10, 2015, Congress has up to 52 days to review the deal and may vote on the agreement in the first 30 days; the President then has 12 days to veto the bill, followed by 10 days for Congress to override such a veto. If the deal is submitted between July 10 and September 7, 2015, Congress has an additional 30 days of review, for a total of up to 82 days.  Joint Resolution of Disapproval: Gives Congress the opportunity to enact a joint resolution of disapproval (over a presidential veto) within the review period. Enactment of a joint resolution of disapproval would prevent the President from waiving or suspending the Congressional sanctions.  Oversight and Compliance: Requires the President to certify to Congress every 90 days that Iran is complying with the agreement. If Iran violates the terms of the deal, the legislation provides an expedited process for Congress to rapidly restore sanctions.  Reporting: Includes new reporting requirements on Irans direct and indirect support for terrorism, human rights violations, and ballistic missile testing. ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- Contact Information: Website: WASHINGTON OFFICE 2402 Rayburn HOB Washington, DC 20515 Phone: (202) 225-4422 Fax: (202) 226-2638 DISTRICT OFFICE 1271 Kelly Johnson Blvd. Suite 110 Colorado Springs, CO 80920 Phone: (719) 520-0055 Fax: (719) 520-0840 DISTRICT OFFICE 415 Main Street Buena Vista, CO 81211 Phone: (719) 520-0055 Fax: (719) 520-0840 Privacy Policy: Unsubscribe: ",2015-01-06,5,Rep.,Representative,true,CO,doug.lamborn@houseenews.net,05/14/2015,Republican,2698,,http://lamborn.house.gov,Representative for Colorado's 5th congressional district,Doug,RepDLamborn,,Lamborn,L000564,202-225-4422,1954-05-24,https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/doug_lamborn/412191,CongressmanLamborn,,representative,1022846,Representative,2017-01-03,Rep.

Inhofe - U.S. Senator - Oklahoma Dear Friends, Currently our federal government releases back into the United States criminally convicted immigrants if their country of origin has not accepted them for deportation within six months. These convicted immigrants that are being set free include those who havecommitted crimes of violence or aggravated felonies, such as sexual assault. Often calledcatch-and-release, this is a disturbing loophole in our federal immigration code that allows criminals to return to ourcommunities andcommit even more crimes against Americans. The numbers show that from 2008-2012, nearly 17,000 immigrants with orders of removal were released back into our communities. In2013 alone, more than 36,000 criminally convicted aliens were released by the U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agencybecause their home countries had yet to take them back. In order to fix this problem created by a couple of Supreme Court cases, earlier this year I introduced the *Keep Our Communities Safe Act**, *which wouldrequire the Department of Homeland Security to recertify a criminal immigrant for continued detention every six months if they are a threat to the community. I intend to pursue all options for getting this important legislation passed, having most recently introduced it as an amendment to the Senates human-trafficking legislation,and this loophole closed.

This week, I took the opportunity to uphold our countrys foundation and protect each of these rights. I protected life by voting for the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act, which bans abortions of babies older than 20 weeks, except in the case of life-threatening pregnancies and those resulting from rape or incest. Research shows that 20-week-old babies have the capacity to feel the excruciating pain caused by abortion, and children born prematurely at this age can thrive when given the chance, love, and excellent medical care. Like our founders, I believe that life  however small  is a sacred gift from God, and I will stay committed to protecting the rights of the unborn. I protected liberty by voting for the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act, which requires the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to withdraw its Waters of the United States (WOTUS) rule. A prime example of executive overreach, this rule expands the scope of EPA oversight from the nations main waterways to all water, including small streams and ponds. The Regulatory Integrity Protection Act rolls back EPAs power grab that would take away the liberty of landowners making decisions about their own property. I protected the pursuit of happiness by voting for the USA FREEDOM Act. This bill reauthorizes the USA PATRIOT Act of 2001 but ends the National Security Agencys (NSA) bulk collection of records. Not only is it possible to simultaneously protect national security and Americans privacy, it is the federal governments responsibility to do so. Americans pursuit of happiness depends upon their security. If protection is breached by either an international force or their own government, Americans cannot enjoy lives of meaning as the founders intended. After defending the U.S. Constitution as a soldier for 21 years, it was my honor to protect the foundation it was written upon this week as a Congressman. I will continue to uphold life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness in the votes to come. As always, it is an honor to be your voice in Congress. Sincerely, Steve Russell  In honor of the 70th anniversary of VE Day, WWII aircraft flew over Washington, D.C.  I sat down with fellow Oklahoman Rep. Tom Cole for his ""Cole on Congress"" show.

[R-VA4]"," This week, a total of 113 Members of Congress filed an amicus brief with the 5th Circuit Court of Appeals in support of a continued injunction against the Administrations executive actions on immigration in the case of Texas v. United States. The amicus brief states that the Presidents deferred action programs for unlawful immigrants are unconstitutional and contrary to Congressional intent. Signers of the brief include Congressman Randy Forbes, House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte, and Senator Ted Cruz, among others. In December, numerous states, led by Texas, filed a lawsuit in federal court challenging the Administrations executive actions on immigration. On February 17, 2015 a federal judge temporarily blocked the unilateral immigration actions. Since then, political appointees at the Justice Department have filed an appeal to lift the injunction.

,114,Male,N00030676,43554,"Long, Billy (Rep.) [R-MO7]","Congressman Billy Long ====================================== Last year, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) and the Army Corps of Engineers jointly proposed a rule clarifying the definition of waterways subject to clean water permits, known as waters of the U.S. In reality, the clarification amounts to a massive land and water grab. It would have a devastating impact on everyday life in the Ozarks, which is why I voted this week to pass the Regulatory Integrity Protection Act [link 1], which would force the EPA to withdraw and reconsider this ridiculous rule. The EPA and the Corps currently only have permit-issuing authority to uphold the natural integrity of our navigable waterways, interstate streams, territorial seas or connected wetlands. The existing standards have been in place since the Clean Water Act of 1972. The proposed expansion, however, would broaden federal power to tributaries, ditches, streams only flowing during heavy rains and waters in flood plains. This massive shift would give the all-powerful EPA authority to require farmers that plow and plant to seek permits beforehand. Construction of barns, homes or businesses would need a permit as well due to potential impact on a local stream. Highway ditches and infrastructure would fall under the expansion. Even if the nearest running stream is miles away, the typically dry creek nearby would be considered a water of the U.S. and any activity surrounding the creek would be unnecessarily stuck with red tape, which could take months to comply with. I have heeded the concerns of Seventh District farmers, businesses and officials about this absurd regulation. It would have undue harm on our areas economy and way of life. Thats why I voted to force the EPA to withdraw the regulation and consider the economic costs, Supreme Court cases and comments from farmers, businesses, state and local officials and anyone whom a reconsidered rule would impact. After all, it is those caring for the land and resources who know best how to protect them. I will continue to fight against the EPA and its nonsensical regulations that pay no mind to generations-old southwest Missouri lifestyles and traditions. ---------------------- footnotes ---------------------- [link 1] ====================================== Contact Information: Website: Office Locations; ------------------------------------- Washington Office 1541 Longworth HOB Washington, DC 20510 Phone: (202) 225-6536 Fax: (202) 225-5604 Springfield Office 3232 E.

My meeting with the Lawton-Fort Sill Chamber of Commerce in Washington, D.C. It was great to give them a legislative update and hear from them.  Senator Inhofe and I met with Wanda Pratt, better known as Mama Durant, in the Capitol.  I had a great visit with the Oklahoma State College of Engineering, Architecture & Technology scholars during their visit to DC.  In the past two weeks, we celebrated the National Day of Prayer and I had the privilege to speak at the Rally for Marriage in front of the United States Supreme Court.  It was an honor to meet the former Lebanese Prime Minister, Saad Hariri. We discussed the current conflicts with Iran and the continued unrest in the Middle East. Dear Oklahoma Friends and Neighbors, The last few weeks have been very busy. The Tulsa and Washington offices moved into new spaces, I gave my first formal address to the Senate, and we passed legislation that will affect how we deal with nuclear negotiations with Iran, our long-term budget and provide transparency for taxpayers. Since we are in the midst of graduation season, I would like to take the opportunity to congratulate all those graduating in the class of 2015. In the commencement address to OSU graduates last weekend, I encouraged them to consider five things: 1) get out of debt, 2) reconnect with your faith, 3) heal family hurts, 4) serve, and 5) dont forget your Oklahoma roots. If you are graduating from high school or college, I wish you all the best in your next steps of life. Congratulations on your remarkable accomplishment. Maiden Floor Speech Last week, I was grateful to give my Maiden Floor Speech  to the Senate. This time-honored tradition dates back to the early 1900s and serves as an opportunity for freshmen senators to outline their agenda. The issues I addressed last week focus on what the Senate can do to turn around our great nation: Debt, Defense and federal Directives.  It was an honor to represent Oklahoma as I discussed the direction of our country, I believe we can reduce the national debt, protect our freedom, and alleviate the regulatory burdens of the federal government on all Oklahomans and Americans. Our values of liberty, hard work and care for our neighbor can lift families out of poverty and provide a strong future for our nation. If you are interested in the history of the Maiden Speech, CLICK HERE  . New Office Space The DC and Tulsa offices finally moved in. The DC staff, which was housed in the basement of the Dirksen office building for the last five months, is now located in 316 Hart Senate Office Building. The major feature for staff - sunlight.

The Tulsa office also moved into their final space. The new contact information for Tulsa is 5810 East Skelly Drive, Suite 1000. Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act Last month, the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act passed unanimously out of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee. The Senate, last week, passed the act by an overwhelming majority of 98-1. The bipartisan support of this bill illustrates how important this legislation is to the safety and security of our nation. The Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act is an important tool for Americans to regain their voice in the negotiations with Iran in regards to their development of a nuclear weapon. The final agreement adopted by the Senate: * Requires the president to submit the final agreement to the American people and Congress for review. * Prohibits the president from waiving the statutory sanctions while Congress reviews the agreement within a certain time frame. * Includes accountability measures through the certification of compliance. * Provides an expedited process for Congress to restore sanctions if Iran is found to be noncompliant. * Allows Congress to enact a joint resolution of disapproval that would permanently prevent the president from suspending congressional sanctions. * Includes reporting requirements on Irans support for terrorism, human rights violations and ballistic missile testing. We must keep Iran accountable for their actions and provide our country the tools to enforce all provisions outlined in the final agreement. To view the full text of the bill, CLICK HERE  . Every Child Achieves Act Oklahomans know best, and when it comes to educating our children, I trust the parents, teachers and students in Oklahoma more than federal bureaucracy in DC. Legislation passed in 2001 was intended to create a level playing field for students but it actually hindered the promotion of excellence, opportunity and achievement. Last month, the Senate Committee on Health, Education, Labor & Pensions (HELP) unanimously passed the Every Child Achieves Act (ECAA) which is a fix to No Child Left Behind (NCLB). ECAA, as passed out of committee, will give control back to the state and local school districts. Additionally, the ECAA will end unnecessary federal testing requirements, eliminate overbearing federal mandates and reduce the regulatory burden on state and local educators. My goal is to protect parents and teachers as they prepare students for success. Well intentioned federal bureaucrats, who have never stepped foot in Oklahoma, should not set the standards for Oklahoma children. I appreciate the thoughts and input of our educators and I remain dedicated to protect our students and schools. To view a copy of the bill passed by the HELP committee, CLICK HERE  .

[R-TX22]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email  News from Congressman Olson  Website  | Contact Us  | How Can I Help?  | Issues  | Legislation  | News Center  | Our District  | About Pete  May 14, 2015 Dear Friend, In the wake of the September 11 attacks on America, our nation's intelligence sharing between federal agencies was overhauled to better connect the dots of information we gather from those who have dedicated their lives to destroying America and everything we stand for. However, in our quest to secure and protect the homeland, questions have arisen about the legality of the government's ability to collect bulk data on its own citizens without due process. A recent court ruling determined that Section 215 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), which is the legal basis the NSA has used to collect bulk records of millions of Americans phone calls, is illegal. I support provisions that allow the government to lawfully obtain a warrant to gather information if they have a reasonable suspicion someone is intent on harming our great nation. That being said, we must have a careful balance between legal law enforcement and individual protections against an overreaching government. That's why this week, I voted to increase protections for all Americans, while maintaining our critical ability to gather information on those seeking to do us harm. I voted in support of the USA Freedom Act, which protects civil liberties by ending bulk collection. Specifically it prohibits bulk collection of ALL records under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act, the FISA pen register authority, and national security letter statutes. The bill also improves transparency and information-sharing by requiring that all significant constructions or interpretations of law by the FISA court must be made public. It strengthens national security by closing loopholes that make it difficult for the government to track foreign terrorists and spies as they enter or leave the country. It also clarifies the application of FISA to foreign targets involved in international proliferation of weapons of mass destruction, increases the maximum penalties for support of a foreign terrorist organization, and extends the sunsets of the expiring PATRIOT Act provisions to December 2019. No American wants a repeat of the atrocities we faced on 9/11/01. I believe this bill corrects an important flaw to strengthen civil liberties for American citizens, while helping us prevent another attack. I will continue to closely monitor the government's role in protecting us to ensure the proper balance. I'm honored to represent you in Congress.

These monuments and grave sites serve as a testament to the sacrifices of our Armed Services and constantly remind me of this country's responsibility to care for our heroes. One of the greatest privileges of serving Nevada in the US Senate is the opportunity to sit on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee. With Nevada being home to over 300,000 veterans, I remain committed to advocating on behalf of the issues facing our veterans. Chief among them is the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) disability claims backlog. Just last week, Senator Bob Casey (D-PA) and I held a press conference to introduce the 21st Century Veterans Benefits Delivery Act (S. 1203), legislation designed to create a system that can withstand surges in disability claims without generating another veterans' disability claims backlog. We also released the VA Backlog Working Group 2015 Report in which we identify the progress that has been made on the claims backlog since 2014, which Working Group recommendations have been implemented by the VA and Congress, and what actions must still be taken to fully transition the VA to a 21st century benefits delivery system. I am proud to spearhead the VA Backlog Working Group with Senator Casey in an effort to ensure a continued decline in wait time for veterans' benefit claims. Following the rollout, Senator Casey and I went on MSNBC's Morning Joe. You can click here to watch our joint interview. The current red tape that veterans face is unacceptable, and until the backlog is eliminated, I won't back down. Recently, I testified at the Senate Committee on Environment & Public Works hearing regarding endangered species. During my testimony, I emphasized that the Endangered Species Act is out of date and ineffective and discussed a legislative effort (S. 1036) to improve sage-grouse conservation. The hearing addressed legislation that I introduced, the Common Sense in Species Protection Act of 2015 (S. 112). This legislation is designed to force the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) to take into account the full economic impact of proposed critical habitat designation for endangered species candidates like the greater sage-grouse. No doubt, a listing of the sage-grouse would devastate Nevada's way of life, and this bill forces the Department of Interior to be forthright about a listing's economic impact. I also spoke on the Senate floor regarding privacy of American citizens. During my time on the floor, I spoke in support of the USA FREEDOM Act. This legislation ends bulk data collection practices currently used by the government under Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act and carefully balances the privacy rights of Americans and the needs of the intelligence community as it works to keep our country safe. I am an original cosponsor of the legislation introduced earlier this year. The last couple of weeks have proven to be productive. I will continue to voice the concerns of my fellow Nevadans as the month progresses.

Veasey Votes in Favor of FY16 NDAA Veaseys DACA Amendment included in FY2016 NDAA Final Passage Today, I voted in support of H.R. 1735, the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2016, a bill that was reported from the House Armed Services Committee with nearly unanimous support. I am honored to serve on the House Armed Services Committee that serves to provide proper resources for our troops and keep our country safe. I believe this bill accomplishes those goals. While no bill is perfect and there are some provisions that I disagree with, this bill includes numerous provisions that I strongly support, such as my bipartisan amendment that requires the Secretary of Defense to evaluate how allowing DREAMERs to serve in our military would impact our military readiness. I believe an objective and unbiased analysis will show that allowing patriotic DREAMERs to serve in our military and put their lives on the line for the only country they have ever known will greatly improve our national security and military recruitment. In addition, this bill contains important funding for key national security programs that are critical for the DFW Metroplex, like funding for six additional F-35 Joint Strike Fighter aircraft, an increase that was accepted at my request, and my amendment to provide an additional $75 million for digital upgrades to the V-22 Osprey. This bill also contains a 2.3% increase in military pay for our troops and a prohibition on conducting another round of Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) that could harm Texas military installations.

[D-IL9]","Congresswoman Jan Schakowsky - Proudly Serving the 9th District of Illinois ==================================================== [image = Americans Month 2015.png] [link 1] Click above to watch my video with Congresswoman Doris Matsui celebrating Older Americans Month [link 2] May is Older Americans Month. Its an important time to talk about the many contributions that older Americans have made and continue to make to our community and to our country. Its also an important time to reflect on the importance of the Older Americans Act, Medicare and Medicaid  which all turn 50 in July  and Social Security, which celebrates its 80th anniversary in August. Together, these four national treasures improve lives and help seniors live in dignity. They are national treasures and they are part of the American landscape. Yet, they are under attack from those are trying to reduce benefits and services. We are hearing from some who want to cut Social Securitys earned benefits, raise the age of eligibility for Social Security and Medicare, or reduce spending for senior housing, nutrition, transportation and job training. The Republican budget resolution passed last month seeks to cut Medicaid  the largest payer for home-based, community and nursing home long-term care services  by more than $1 trillion over the next 10 years. That same budget would also repeal major improvements made to Medicare in the Affordable Care Act  raising prescription drug costs to seniors as well as people with disabilities. As co-chair of the Democratic Caucus Seniors Task Force, Im fighting as hard as I can to protect Social Security, Medicare, Medicaid and the Older Americans Act. But simply protecting them as is is not enough. More and more Americans are concerned that they will never be able to retire and maintain their standard of living  or that they may not be able to retire at all. The National Institute for Retirement Security estimates that the average working household has only $2,500 saved for retirement and households headed by someone age 55 to 64 have only $14,500. Nearly 3 in 4 Americans will rely on their earned Social Security benefits for the majority of their income; for 1 in 4, it is their only source of income. That is why I believe we need to expand benefits and provide a more accurate cost-of-living adjustment. I also believe we need to look at ways to make health care more affordable. One step we could take is to expand Medicare to cover vision, dental and hearing services. And its time that we provide enact a long-term care strategy  one of the biggest expenses that face older Americans and their families.

,114,Male,N00006263,43390,"Simpson, Michael “Mike” (Rep.) [R-ID2]","House Passes Simpsons Energy and Water Bill House Energy and Water Chairman reverses Obama Administrations nuclear cuts, increases INL funding Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson praised the House passage of the Fiscal Year 2016 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill, which reverses proposed cuts to Idaho National Laboratory (INL), the Department of Energys Office of Nuclear Energy, and cleanup activities in Idaho. Simpson is Chairman of the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Energy and Water Development and had the lead role in deciding funding for all Department of Energy programs. The legislation passed the U.S. House of Representatives with a final vote of 240-177. I am pleased to report that the Energy and Water bill rejects cuts proposed by the Obama Administration to nuclear energy programs and increases funding for many of the vital research efforts at INL, said Simpson. The funding increases we have been able to secure will build on our previous work, and continue to make a real impact accelerating nuclear innovation programs and addressing much needed infrastructure enhancements at INL. These investments will make sure nuclear energy remains an important component of our nation's energy mix. The FY 2016 Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill sets funding for the DOEs Office of Nuclear Energy at $936 million, an increase of $102.6 million above fiscal year 2015 and $28.5 million above the Presidents request. Nuclear energy research and development programs that receive funding within the overall $936 million allocation include:  The Idaho Facilities Management account, which covers infrastructure maintenance and improvement at INL, is funded at $218.5 million  a $12.5 million increase over last year and $6.7 million above the Presidents request.  INLs Safeguards and Security Program is funded at $126.1 million  an increase of $22.1 million over fiscal year 2015.  The Nuclear Energy Enabling Technologies program is funded at $111 million  an increase of $10.6 million above fiscal year 2015 and $25 million above the Presidents request.  Small Modular Reactor Licensing Support Programs are funded at $62.5 million. This funding is slated for NuScale Powers Small Modular Reactor which is proposed for construction in Idaho.  The Light Water Reactor Sustainability program, which is managed by INL and promotes the continued safe operation of Americas existing nuclear reactors, is funded at $40 million.  The Reactor Concepts Research, Development, and Demonstration account is funded at $141 million  an increase of $8.7 million above fiscal year 2015 and $33.5 million above the Presidents request. Within the overall $141 million level for this account, $33 million is allocated to fuel qualification for the High Temperature Gas Reactor.  Within the Fuel Cycle Research and Development program, the Advanced Fuels program is funded at $60.1 million, the same as fiscal year 2015; and Used Nuclear Fuel Disposition research and development is funded at $55 million, $16.5 million below fiscal year 2015.  Within the Office of Naval Reactors, the bill includes $71.2 million for the operation of the Advanced Test Reactor.  Within the Office of Electricity Delivery and Energy Reliability, the bill includes $5 million for the development of an Electric Grid Test Bed program to enhance existing full-scale electric grid testing capabilities like those at Idaho National Laboratory. The bill provides $390 million for cleanup activities associated with the Idaho Cleanup Project and the Advanced Mixed Waste Treatment Project co-located on the Idaho desert with INL. The funding level of $390 million is an increase of $10.5 million above fiscal year 2015 and $30 million above the Presidents request, which will allow the significant cleanup activities currently underway to continue. There is also an additional $2 million for the National Spent Fuel Program, putting the unique expertise of INL to work in order to provide solutions for managing the Department of Energys inventories of spent nuclear fuel. Despite the Obama Administrations unilateral decision to disregard the federal governments legal requirement to take responsibility for civilian spent nuclear fuel, the bill contains funding to support the continued adjudication of the Yucca Mountain license application, ensuring the federal government will meet its commitments to Idaho and other states and dispose of used nuclear fuel. Overall, the Energy and Water Development Appropriations bill provides $35.4 billion for the functions of the Department of Energy, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Bureau of Reclamation and a number of independent agencies, including direction for the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the Bonneville Power Administration. This is a responsible bill that prioritizes national security needs and improving our nation's infrastructure within tight budget caps, Simpson said. As we do every year, we worked hard to incorporate perspectives from all members, and the result is legislation that makes critical investments in the maintenance and safety of our nuclear weapons stockpile, while also funding important infrastructure projects and research that will increase U.S. economic competitiveness and growth."" The bill will be conferenced with the Senate Energy and Water Appropriations bill later this year. The complete Committee Report can be found at: Simpson Secures Idaho Truck Weight Language Idaho Congressmans language creates a level playing field with neighboring states which will result in a boost to Idahos economic activity Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson has once again secured language in the House Transportation, Housing and Urban Development (THUD) Appropriations bill to allow trucks weighing up to 129,000 pounds on Idaho Interstates. The current weight limit in Idaho of 105,500 pounds blocks trucks from entering the Interstate system, instead, relegating them to certain state highways or outside of Idaho completely. Idahos neighbors Montana, Wyoming, Utah and Nevada all allow higher weights than Idaho, putting Idahos most important job creators, particularly agriculture, at a competitive disadvantage. My language, which I first introduced in 2008, has been sought by the State of Idaho for years, and I am pleased to see it included in the House draft today, said Simpson. It would simply put Idaho on a level playing field with its neighbors and at the same time be a major generator of economic activity. I am thankful to THUD Appropriations Chairman Diaz-Balart for including this provision in the bill. Simpsons language comes after completion of a ten-year comprehensive Idaho study which found the weight increase would have no significant impact on roadway safety, nor would it significantly affect the structural soundness of Idahos bridges or pavement. In fact, heavier trucks have more axels than traditional trucks, distributing the weight in such a way that it has less impact on the roadway and allows the truck to brake more efficiently and stop more abruptly if needed. The weight increase would also take one of five trucks off the road. I am well aware that when people hear that there will be heavier trucks on the highway they become concerned. It seems logical that a heavier truck would be more dangerous. However, that is not the case, said Simpson. These heavier trucks have been proven to be safe in Idaho. They are already using our state highways today. This language will simply allow these same trucks to use the Interstate. It takes them off of smaller roadways and out of communities and puts them on the Interstate, where they belong. The THUD bill was marked up and passed by the subcommittee, and will go to the full Appropriations Committee for consideration this week, before going to the House floor. Last year, the bill, with Simpsons Idaho language included, passed in the House of Representatives, but it did not survive negotiations with the Senate. Chairman Mike Simpson Protects States Water Rights Defeats amendment that would allow expansion of federal jurisdiction over water Idaho Congressman Mike Simpson, House Energy and Water Appropriations Subcommittee Chairman, has led a successful effort to defeat an amendment that would have stripped a section of the Energy and Water Appropriations bill prohibiting any changes to federal jurisdiction under the Obama Administrations Waters of the United States"" proposal. The proposed rule would expand the reach of the Clean Water Act by replacing the term navigable waters with the term waters of the United States. Non-navigable waters are currently regulated by the states. Striking this term means that the Act could be broadly interpreted to included everything within a state, including ground water. Chairman Simpson fought the amendment on the House floor stating, Many people believed that if the waters were not regulated under the Clean Water Act, they were unregulated. Not true. They are regulated by the states. And thats how it should remain. . . While there may be a desire for clarity on federal jurisdiction, providing clarity does not trump the need to stay within the limits of the law. The proposed rule would expand federal jurisdiction far beyond what was ever intended by the Clean Water Act. The provision in the Energy and Water bill does not weaken the Clean Water Act; it stops the Administration from expanding federal jurisdiction. For those reasons I strongly oppose this amendment and encourage my colleagues to vote no. The amendment was offered by Representative Don Beyer (D-VA), and failed on a voice vote.

,114,Male,N00009154,43313,"Goodlatte, Bob (Rep.) [R-VA6]"," Rep. Bob Goodlatte Small Businesses Have Large Impacts on Local Economies Driving through the Sixth Congressional District is a lesson in the role small businesses play in shaping and growing our communities. Whether it's a hardware store that's been around for generations, an assisted living facility that prides itself on quality care, or a tech startup paving the way forward, small businesses are instrumental in driving local economies and providing jobs for our family members, neighbors, and friends. In fact, half of America's workforce in the private sector is employed by small businesses. As we mark Small Business Week, it is important that we applaud the men and women who are behind them. Small business owners are no strangers to sacrifice. They sacrifice their time by putting in long hours, and, in some cases, their own pay to ensure that employees receive a pay check. A recent report found that 67 percent of small business owners would delay or reduce their own compensation in order to make ends meet. As any small business owner or entrepreneur can attest, many challenges are faced on a daily basis. One of these is the uncertainty of costly government mandates and regulations. It's a significant challenge for these businesses to understand and comply with poorly crafted and ever-growing regulations. Small businesses deserve a voice in Washington. In honor of National Small Business Week, I made several stops at small businesses in Lexington. Top left to right: Talking w/ Lexington Prescription Center about regulations; touring Cornerstone Bank; visiting folks at Heritage Hall; and, stopping by Kenney's. Earlier this year, I was proud to support the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act both in the House Judiciary Committee and the full House of Representatives. This bill delivers a simple, common sense mandate to the Executive Branch: Work together with small businesses and design smarter, less burdensome rules that account for their unique concerns. It only makes sense that those imposing regulations in Washington would be required to communicate better with the small business community and actively search for ways to reduce unnecessary burdens. American innovation is critical to a competitive global economy, and many small businesses are at the forefront of that innovation. In fact, small businesses ""produce 16.5 times more patents per employee than large firms."" However, this innovation is all too often threatened by abusive patent lawsuits. Many small businesses do not have access to the resources required to defend themselves. Forty percent of small companies threatened with a patent lawsuit reported a ""significant operational impact"" such as delayed hiring. My bill, the Innovation Act, would address these costly, unfair practices and help strengthen the patent system to ensure the protection of American inventions and innovation. The Innovation Act has strong bipartisan support, and I am working to see these important protections approved by Congress. The impact of small businesses on our local economies is anything but small. More than 1.4 million Virginians are employed by these businesses. It's these folks who are building an economy of opportunity, and Congress has the opportunity now to advance policies that protect free enterprise, create certainty in the tax code, and cut red tape.

Murphy Joins 911th Families Before Deployment Murphy Recognized As ""Champion"" For Advancing Children's Mental Health Documentary Film on the Needs of Veterans' Mental Health Premieres in Pittsburgh Honoring George Washington, A Man of Prayer Murphy Visits Mining Facilities in Washington County Murphy Joins 911th Families Before Deployment  Today, Congressman Murphy was on hand to see off the 911th Airlift Wing operation and maintenance personnel, who are being deployed to support operations in Southwest Asia. The Pittsburgh unit will support operations within the United States Central Command by delivering supplies and equipment to various locations in the Mid-East over the next four months. It is the eleventh time the reservists have been deployed since the September 11th terrorist attacks. More than 1,300 reservists and 300 civilian employees are stationed at the 911th Airlift Wing, which houses eight C-130 Hercules transport planes and is one of the most efficient, skilled, and mission-ready airlift units in the country. Recently, the 911th Airlift Wing was selected for being the 2015 Commander-in-Chiefs Annual Award for Installation Excellence.  When the Air Force proposed to retire 65 C-130 air cargo planes nationwide and close the 911th Airlift Wing as part of a ""cost-cutting"" effort, Rep. Murphy led the successful effort to prevent the 911th's closure. Working with the Pennsylvania delegation and other lawmakers, Murphy successfully passed legislation to prevent closure of the base through March 2013. The base contributes $125 million to the local economy and the base has unique cost saving measures like a long term lease with the local airport authority, which provides runway maintenance, emergency services, air traffic control, snow removal, and other benefits for only $20,000 a year. The effort to preserve the 911th began in 2004 when Murphy successfully fought the Pentagon, which had marked the base on its recommended list of closures, to keep the airlift wing open. Greeting the families this morning from the Pittsburgh International Airport Air Reserve Station, Congressman Murphy wished them safe travels and mission. The 911th Airlift wing is currently under the command of Colonel Jeff Van Dootingh, who last week updated Murphy on the recent accomplishment and needs of the base as Congress is set to soon vote on the National Defense Authorization Act. Murphy Recognized As ""Champion"" For Advancing Children's Mental Health  With George Stephanopoulos - listen to Rep. Murphy speak with Sirius XM here  . On Monday, Congressman Tim Murphy accepted the inaugural Champion Award at the 1st Annual Child Mind Institute Change Maker Awards. ABC News Chief Anchor, George Stephanopoulos, presented the award to Mr. Murphy for his work in advancing his landmark legislation, the Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act. The Child Mind Institute, founded by Dr. Harold S. Koplewicz and Brooke Garber Neidich, is committed to finding more effective treatments for childhood psychiatric and learning disorders, building the science of healthy brain development, and empowering children and their families with help, hope, and answers. I am humbled and honored to have been awarded the inaugural Champion Award by the Child Mind Institute. But truly the champions in children's mental health are those who are in the trenches each and every day working to further research, treatment and services for kids with mental illness, said Congressman Murphy. In his acceptance speech, Murphy told the audience he was weeks away from introducing the latest version on his Helping Families in Mental Health Crisis Act. The Child Mind Institutes Change Maker Awards  celebrates the work of individuals and organizations that give voice to childrens mental health. First Lady of New York City Chirlane McCray, Bloomingdales CEO Tony Spring, Founder and Executive Director of Active Minds Alison Malmon, and New York City public schools social worker Angela Renz were also honored during the ceremony. The award comes a week after Congressman Murphy introduced a bipartisan congressional resolution designating May as Mental Health Month, which will help remove the stigma associated with mental illness and promote public awareness of mental health. As Rep. Murphy told  Sirius XMs Morning Briefing host Tim Farley, I have heard from hundreds of thousands of families across America who deal with severe mental illness and theyve told us about a whole host of problems they encounter. This isnt just an attitudinal issue. We have to recognize mental illness is a brain disease and attack it like a cancer, or diabetes, or AIDS, and say we can indeed treat mental illness if we are serious and stop those tragedies.

Murphy about vets' mental health. Congressman Murphy joined the cast of the documentary That Which I Love Destroys Me at SouthSide Works Cinema for the Pittsburgh premiere. The film follows two Special Forces veterans  Tyler Grey and Jayson Floyd  and charts their journey of healing through their struggle to rebuild relationships with family and exploring the trauma up close. The movie, which also includes Rep. Murphy, premiered on Pivot TV channel on Veterans Day last fall. Initially, the film was going to follow Grey and Floyd for a few months, but filmmakers saw a powerful story behind the veterans transition home. Consequently, director Roman Waugh taped both veterans over the course of a few years. The Pittsburgh premiere is part of a ten-city screening tour across the country. Congressman Murphy appears at the end of the documentary, discussing post-traumatic stress and veterans mental health. Murphy is also a Lt. Commander in the Navy Reserve Medical Service Corps and works with servicemembers dealing with post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injury at Walter Reed National Military Medical Center in Bethesda, Md. Following the premiere Murphy participated in a panel with Grey, the Armed Forces Foundation, and Justice For Vets for a Q & A session where panelists discussed the critical issues facing the post-9 during the ceremony  and made participants aware just how important faith is to members of Congress: We actually pray all the time  most often in private, but tonight were here as witnesses to each other before God. To share your thoughts on the Washington Man of Prayer ceremony, please click  here  Murphy Visits Mining Facilities in Washington County On Thursday, Congressman Murphy was in Washington County, visiting with local employees of two of the world's leading manufacturers to the mining industry, Caterpillar Global Mining and Joy Mining. The specialty work performed at the companies' Houston facilities is closely tied to energy production and the demand for coal, which has been under constant attack from Obama Administration. Murphy, who has been leading the congressional effort to hold the EPA accountable for overstepping authority in an attempt to shut down coal, discussed a recent hearing held in the House Energy & Commerce Committee focusing on the impact and cost of EPAs proposed carbon dioxide rule for existing power plants. The featured witness, President Obama's former constitutional law professor, called the Administrations plan a power grab that violates the Constitution. In his testimony the professor said, the EPA is attempting an unconstitutional trifecta: usurping the prerogatives of the States, Congress and the Federal Courts  all at once, Tribe says in his prepared remarks for a House Energy and Commerce subcommittee. Burning the Constitution should not become part of our national energy policy. Congressman Murphy has been working with his colleagues to stop the EPA from advancing the plan. As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations, Murphy has been investigating how the EPA refuses to account for such things as job loss and economic damage caused by regulatory actions that do not substantially improve environmental conditions. Murphy is a sponsor of the Coal Jobs Protection Act (H.R. 5077), requiring the EPA to analyze the impact of proposed regulations on jobs and economic activity. If the analysis shows a loss of jobs and damage to the states economy, the EPA would be required to hold a public hearing in a place like Greene County that would be most impacted by the proposed action to incorporate that data. Litigation is currently pending before the U.S. Court of Appeals that challenges whether the EPA has authority to issue regulations requiring individual states to meet costly federally-mandated emissions standards. Congressman Murphy joined House Energy and Power Subcommittee Chairman Ed Whitfield (R-KY) as a co-sponsor of the Ratepayer Protection Act (H.R. 2042) to prohibit the EPA's plan from moving forward until its constitutionality has been decided in federal court. In addition, the legislation also allows individual states to opt-out of the EPA's onerous requirements; if they can demonstrate that the federal action would threaten the state's power grid or will lead to higher power bills for residents.

,114,Male,N00024753,43472,"Coffman, Mike (Rep.) [R-CO6]","Congressman Mike Coffman - Serving the 6th District of Colorado ========================================================= [image =  Dear Friends: This week I want to share my editorial that recently ran in the Aurora Sentinel, highlighting a successful program at my old high school that is making a real difference: There has been a lot of talk about Aurora Central High School being ranked among the failed schools and being forced to make significant reforms subject to the approval of the Colorado Department of Education given low test scores and poor graduation rates. However, last month I had the opportunity to visit Aurora Central High School to witness a tremendous success story called Boys Hope, Girls Hope (BHGH). BHGH is a nonprofit that provides an array of services to Aurora Central High School student participants in order to fully prepare them, not just to graduate from high school, but to go to college. The young people who participate in this program come from disadvantaged backgrounds and are sometimes the first in their family to finish high school and often the first to consider going to college. They have access to after school programs that include tutoring, mentoring, as well as recreational activities. They are surrounded by adult volunteers who inspire them to challenge themselves to better their lives and to lay a foundation for their future through academic success. The BHGH students are required to take challenging courses and are literally students of a school-within-a-school at Aurora Central High School. Some of the students are in a residential program, sponsored by BHGH, where they live apart from their families while going to high school. I met about 50 students participating in the BHGH program when I visited Central High School last month. They first wanted to know what it was like to serve in Congress and to work in Washington, D.C. They peppered me with thoughtful questions about a wide range of issues that I have to vote on, as well as what inspired me to be in politics and about my career path in the military and as a small business owner. Normally, when I visit schools, I have to work to get the young people interested in public policy issues but these students didnt have to be prompted. They were informed, engaged and projected confidence. I was so deeply impressed with them that it gave me a sense of optimism that Aurora Central High School can be a success, not just for the students that participate in BHGH but for all of the students at the school, if the school can fundamentally change to meet the unique needs of this diverse student population. We owe it to them. We owe it to all of the children in our community. Im so proud of the students who are in BHGH at Aurora Central High School because I know that they will have a bright future ahead of them thanks to the leadership of this nonprofit and to the adult volunteers that care enough to get involved in order to make a difference. No doubt, I worry about the children who are not in BHGH and who have been failed by a system that is not designed to make a meaningful difference in their lives. In those young people I fear that they will never be given the chance to be full participants in our community and could be trapped in a life of poverty without any hope of ever escaping it. Im glad that the Colorado Department of Education is forcing change at Aurora Central High School. My hope is that whatever decision is made, it is made on behalf of the students at Aurora Central High School and not a list of well-intentioned cosmetic changes that are convenient or politically acceptable to those who work at the school. There is just too much at stake. Sincerely, [image = *Mike Coffman U.S. Representative * [image = If you would like to sign up to receive regular email updates from Mike, please visit this link [link 1] [image = $18,159,553,622,987 [image = on Facebook [link 2] [image = [link 3] [image = on Twitter [link 4] [image = on LinkedIn [link 5] *VA Boss Passes the Buck* *By: Staff* *South Carolina Post and Courier* [link 6] *Published May 6, 2015* President Barack Obama brought in Robert McDonald to head the troubled Department of Veterans Affairs last year after discovery of fraudulent records, a pattern of reprisals against whistleblowers and a deadly failure to treat eligible veterans in a timely fashion by the agencys health administration. Now Secretary McDonald, a West Point graduate who served in the military and corporate-executive realms, has evidently fallen into the familiar trap of exaggerating his accomplishments and blaming Congress for his problems. Doing so reduces the nations confidence in his ability to manage his troubled agency. Earlier this year, Mr. McDonald told NBCs Meet the Press, Nine hundred employees have been fired since I became secretary, implying that they were accountable for lapses in the VA system. Included among them, he said, were 60 people who manipulated wait times to falsely claim veterans were not being denied timely appointments. He added that about 100 senior leaders ... are also under investigation. But VA documents provided to Congress and recently reported by The New York Times appear to refute these claims. They show that the department punished only eight of its 280,000 employees for involvement in the scandal. The Times reported that one was fired, one was forced to retire, one is about to be fired and five were reprimanded or suspended for up to two months. So much for a clean sweep. House Veterans Affairs Committee Chairman Jeff Miller, R-Fla., noticed  and exposed  the self-serving discrepancies in the secretarys version of events. In a letter to Mr. McDonald late last week, Rep. Miller pointed out that your own misstatements to the media prompted his committees decision to release data setting the record straight. Yet the secretary seems determined to play the victim. In a recent appearance before the Association of Health Care Journalists, he blamed the VAs problems on a tight budget and a rising work load, presumably caused by an aging veteran population. He also complained about a House-proposed cut in next years budget of $1.4 billion  or less than 1 percent. Never mind that the VAs budget has increased by roughly two-thirds during the Obama presidency to $164 billion this year. The Veterans Affairs secretary also said Congress was not providing enough funds for the agencys construction program at a time when he is being asked to explain huge overruns on construction projects, including a new hospital in Denver that has so far cost $1.7 billion. In a testy exchange with* Rep. Mike Coffman*, R-Colo., Mr. McDonald rejected responsibility for the overruns, saying, If theres a problem in Denver, I think you [Congress] own it more than I do. However, the VA, not Congress, manages the construction program. Meanwhile, evidence is accumulating that whistleblowers in the department are still being subjected to retaliation. Whatever steps Mr. McDonald has taken to discipline abuses of power have clearly not been sufficient to bring senior VA health officials in line. Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley, R-Iowa, has said the VA is suffering from an epidemic of retaliation against whistleblowers and has written McDonald to ask what steps, if any, are being taken to put an end to the practice. Courageous whistleblowers at several VA hospitals last year provided the first evidence of fraudulent records and denial of service at the VA. By inflating his achievements while failing to stop abusive staff practices and by passing the buck, Mr. McDonald raises serious questions about his fitness for the job. If he cant do better, the administration should start looking for leadership that can. *House Approves Bill Banning VA SES Bonuses* *By: Shefali Kapadia* *Federal News Radio* [link 7] *Published May 4, 2015* Lawmakers are once again taking a stab at the Veterans Affairs Department, in hopes of holding executives more accountable for widespread problems at the agency. Senior executives at the Veterans Affairs would not get performance bonuses, under an amendment to the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations Bill of 2016. Rep. Keith Rothfus (R-Pa.) introduced the amendment, claiming it would help to fix poor management and improve accountability at VA facilities. ""One only needs to take a quick survey of the tremendous investigative work that Chairman [Jeff] Miller (R-Fla.), *Congressman Mike Coffman* (R-Colo.) and the rest of my colleagues on the Veterans' Affairs Committee have been doing to see that, despite our efforts to reform and improve the agency culture at the VA, little to nothing has changed,"" Rothfus said. Same amendment, take three The House passed the amendment on a voice vote Wednesday, before approving the full appropriations bill Thursday on a vote of 255 to 163, largely along party lines. The spending bill includes $163 billion in discretionary and mandatory funding for VA  a $4.1 billion increase over this year, but still $1.5 billion lower than the White House's request for 2016. The White House has threatened to veto the measure, saying it ""fails to fully fund critical priorities."" VA Secretary Bob McDonald also said the funding is inadequte, and it would ""cause veterans to suffer."" The push to prohibit performance awards for senior executives isn't a new calling from Rothfus. He successfully introduced the same amendment to the last two MilCon-VA spending bills. ""Senior executives must take responsibility for their failure to fix the problems, and until they do so, these dollars are better spent providing our veterans the first-rate care they rightly deserve."" But senior executives are not the only employees responsible for fixing problems at VA, said Carol Bonosaro, president of the Senior Executives Association. ""His amendment will only serve to place an obstacle in the way of VA recruiting and retaining the best and the brightest, and ignores the fact that Senior Executives do not receive locality pay nor cost of living increases, as do General Schedule employees. Performance awards are an integral part of SES compensation. Once again, this is short-sighted congressional micro-management and will not serve our veterans well in the end,"" Bonosaro said in an email to Federal News Radio. A VA spokesman told Federal News Radio, ""VA does not have a position on the amendment and generally does not comment on legislation outside of Congressional hearings."" Is the amendment the right approach? In his remarks on the House floor, Rothfus pointed to problems at VA's regional office in Philadelphia. An inspector general report last month found officials changed dates on disability claims to make them look newer and paid more than $2 million in duplicate benefit payments. The spending bill collectively allocates about half a billion dollars for disability claims processing and reducing the backlog. It also provides nearly $1 billion for VA construction projects. House Republicans said they hope that money will fix ""egregious project management and cost overruns,"" including a VA construction site near Denver, which is now years behind schedule and $1 billion over budget. *Coffman* introduced a bill in March that would stop VA from giving out any bonuses until it finishes the construction in Aurora, Colorado. His rationale  suspending bonuses would allow construction to finish in a ""deficit-neutral manner."" Just last week, Sen. Ron Johnson (R-Wis.) introduced a bill to let VA discipline or dismiss doctors who perform poorly or commit misconduct. The bill comes after several reports at regional VA medical centers, including Tomah, Wisconsin, which was dubbed ""Candy Land"" for how many opiates and painkillers doctors prescribed to veterans. Although lawmakers agreed the VA has a host of problems it needs to fix, not all thought Rothfus' amendment was the right approach.

[R-PA]"," Standing With Law Enforcement On Tuesday afternoon, I took to the Senate floor to deliver a speech in support of law enforcement following the unrest and looting in Baltimore. We need to have a conversation about bad police practices, but we also need to have a conversation about what a great job the vast majority of police are doing across our country and how much they deserve our thanks and our support. The overwhelming majority of law enforcement officers are honest men and women. They have very high ethical standards and they don't have a racist bone in their bodies. The next time there is a demonstration about police conduct, I hope it is a demonstration to thank the police for their dedication, their hard work, and their courage. That is a demonstration that I will be honored to join. You can watch my floor speech here. You can also read more about my support of law enforcement in the Philadelphia Inquirer and the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette. On a related note, the Senate recently passed two bipartisan bills that I am proud to have cosponsored to help keep law enforcement safe. The first is the Bulletproof Vest Partnership Grant Program Reauthorization Act, which - as the name implies - helps local police departments buy this life-saving equipment. The second is the National Blue Alert Act, which establishes a national alert system to help track down those who threaten, injure, or kill a law enforcement officer. Remembering Our Fallen Heroes On Wednesday, I visited the National Law Enforcement Officers Memorial in Washington, D.C. to pay my respects to our fallen officers, especially Pennsylvania State Trooper Corporal Bryon Dickson. Corporal Dickson was killed last year in the line of duty, and his name was recently etched into the stone at this important memorial. You can see his name in the photo above, just above my hand. Our police men and women are dedicated public servants who put their lives on the line every day in the name of serving and protecting. Our police have incredibly difficult and important jobs to do. My visit to this memorial serves as a reminder of those who have paid the ultimate sacrifice to serve and protect their communities. I am grateful for our law enforcement officials, and next time you see a police officer, I encourage you to thank him or her. You can watch a video of my visit to this memorial here. Corporal Dickson, and all our fallen police officers, will not be forgotten. Military Leaders, War College Students Visit DC I met with students attending the United States Army War College this week in my Washington office. The War College is in Carlisle just to the southwest of Harrisburg. American service members, civilians, and international military officers attend this outstanding institution. The class I met with included students from Poland, Lithuania, and Ethiopia. Cutting The VA Backlog I am a member of the bipartisan Senate VA Backlog Working Group, and this week I was pleased to team up with Senator Bob Casey to unveil legislation to reform the broken claims system at the Department of Veterans Affairs. The backlog of veterans' disabilities claims in our state and nationwide is a disgrace. But we may not know truly how far behind the VA is in processing these cases because it appears management has been covering up the problem. Moreover, management may not have followed standard or basic VA guidelines for audits, or in some cases, veterans' privacy. This is simply unacceptable and outrageous. I will continue working with Senator Casey and other members of the bipartisan Senate VA Backlog Working Group to help tackle this critical and longstanding issue. You can read more about our efforts here. Honoring A Pennsylvania Hero Do you know the name Mike Crescenz? Corporal Michael J. Crescenz was a Philadelphia native and served in the Vietnam War. He has a truly incredible story - one of bravery and heroism that made him Philly's only Medal of Honor recipient of the Vietnam War. And now, after my bipartisan bill passed the Senate unanimously last December, the Woodland Avenue Veterans Affairs Medical Center in Philadelphia has been renamed after this amazing hero. I spoke at the renaming ceremony last weekend, and I enjoyed hearing from Corporal Crescenz's family about his life and legacy. I hope the renaming of this medical center will serve as a reminder of the sacrifices of all of Pennsylvania's Vietnam War veterans. You can read about the renaming ceremony here.

Dr. Rand Paul & Senators Ernst and Boxer Introduce Legislation to Arm the Kurds in Support of Fight Against ISIS This week, Sens. Joni Ernst (R-IA), Barbara Boxer (D-CA), and I introduced bipartisan legislation to provide for a temporary, emergency authorization of defense equipment, defense services, and related training directly to the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG). This legislation would allow the U.S. to provide direct assistance to the KRG, a critical partner in the fight against ISIS, using funds already designated to support the Iraqi Security Forces. Defeating ISIS requires active participation from our allies in the region. I support sending arms to the Kurdish fighters who are providing the vital boots on the ground. The Administration claims they need the legal authority to arm the Kurds.

,114,Male,N00028463,43494,"Roe, David “Phil” (Rep.) [R-TN1]","In addition to being National Small Business Week, this week was also Teacher Appreciation Week. Visiting schools and classrooms is one of my favorite things to do as a Congressman. In East Tennessee were fortunate to have some of the best teachers in the country. Ive seen firsthand how hard these educators work to provide their students with a quality education, and Im proud that Governor Haslam has consistently made education a priority for our state. All of my children went through public schools in our area, and theyve all gone on to succeedin part because of the education they received. I was encouraged by last years TCAP results; nearly 50 percent of Algebra II students are now at grade level, up from the 31 percent in 2011. Achievement gaps for minority students have narrowed and approximately 100,000 additional Tennesseans are on grade level in math compared to 2010. Scores are improving and Tennessee is leading the way for other states by prioritizing education. While things continue to improve, its clear there is more work to do. Did you know that one out of every five students drops out of high school? When traveling around the district, Ive spoken to many teachers who are frustrated by the bureaucracy they are forced to deal with. Many educators have expressed their concern that new requirements and federal regulations have left them less time to do what they love and do best, teach students. These are people who have dedicated their careers to educating children. I know many who have spent nights and weekends working on lesson plans and used their own funds to buy items for their classrooms or for students whose families cannot afford supplies. I strongly believe we must return control to the local level. Just as a one-size-fits-all approach doesnt work for health care reform, it will not work for education. Each state, school district and student are different, and local administrators, teachers and parentsnot the federal governmentshould make decisions based on whats best for their students. It is telling that, at a time when the federal government is more involved in K-12 education than ever before, student success is slow to improve. No Child Left Behind was well-intentioned, but its past time to reform this flawed law. H.R. 5, the Student Success Act would do just that. I know theres been quite a bit of misinformation floating around about what the bill does and doesnt do, so I wanted to share a few facts. The most important thing that the Student Success Act does is return important decision-making power to the states. It replaces the national accountability system with a state-led one, ensuring local leaders have a chance to weigh in. It also eliminates more than 65 duplicative, expensive and unnecessary programs and replaces them with a Local Academic Flexible Grant, providing funding for school systems to better serve and support their students. I also hear strong concern from parents, educators and administrators about the Common Core curriculum standards. The standards started out a collaborative initiative of state educators, but the administration began requiring states to adopt the standards in order to get additional federal funds. H.R. 5 would prevent the Secretary of Education from forcing states to adopt Common Core and give state legislators the freedom to make their own decisions about what standards work best for their states. If we fail to act, however, the administration can continue coercing states, so its critical we come to agreement to return decision-making to the state and local level. Our teachers are some of the most important people in our children and grandchildrens lives, and it is my job as a Congressman and a member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee to give them the tools they need to make their work easier, not harder. This Teacher Appreciation Week, I am extremely grateful to all the educators in the First District and around the country and I hope youll join me in thanking them for a job well done.

[R-FL6]"," A Message From the Office of Congressman DeSantis Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email   Contact Me  Constituent Services  Media Center  Legislation  Help With a Federal Agency  Dear Friend- Americans of all political backgrounds overwhelmingly support term limits  , yet attempts to impose them have floundered in Congress. This week, I introduced legislation that takes a new approach by phasing in congressional term limits. This strategy reconciles the self-interest of members of Congress with the public's desire to see these changes enacted and gives us the best chance to make term limits a reality. Term limits don't have traction in Congress because the wishes of the public are at odds with the self-interest of individual members of Congress. The primary reason politicians seek to curry favor with the public is so that they can perpetuate themselves in office; heeding the desires of the public becomes much less attractive if it means forcing them out of office. My legislation would gradually implement term limits on the federal level: As members of Congress retire and/or are defeated for reelection, succeeding members would be term limited. I agree that it would be better to apply the limits immediately to all members; at the same time, a gradual approach makes the likelihood of getting the requisite two-thirds votes in each house of Congress much higher. You can read more in my op-ed published at the Daily Signal  . _____ Congress needs to live under the same rules as everybody else. It is a basic tenet of a republican system of government that those who are elected or appointed in the government are not above the people that they serve. Despite employing tens of thousands of people, Congress has categorized themselves as a small business with less than 50 employees, allowing members of Congress and their staff to purchase health insurance through D.C.'s Small Business Exchange. This move clearly oversteps and ignores the language of the law. Indeed, making an affirmative declaration that Congress is a small business with fewer than 50 people in order to qualify members of Congress for better health insurance constitutes a fraud. I recommend reading this National Review article  detailing Sen. David Vitter's investigation into this possible fraud. Last month, Sen. Vitter sought to subpoena the application to the small business exchange so that we can figure out how it came to be that Congress claimed to have fewer than 50 employees. Incredibly, a bipartisanship group of Senators on the Senate Small Business Committee blocked Vitter from issuing a subpoena. I have introduced the No Exemption for Washington from ObamaCare Act  to put an end to special treatment for Congress under ObamaCare and I will continue to investigate this issue further. _____ On Thursday, the Senate passed the Iran Nuclear Review Agreement Act, which will now be considered, perhaps next week, in the House. I will review the Act but do hope that amendments will be allowed. A number of Senators offered what I thought were very important amendments ranging from requiring the deal to mandate the dismantling of Iran's nuclear infrastructure to making Iran recognize Israel's right to exist. These amendments were not considered in the Senate, and the bill passed without these improvements. I am also bothered by the fact that the Iran negotiations have overlooked Iran's hostile actions during the Iraq war. The Obama administration is prepared to provide billions of dollars in sanctions relief to a regime that killed hundreds of U.S. servicemembers, yet Iran is not going to be required to accept responsibility for waging war against Americans.

It&rsquo;s prospective parent information day, and you make the trek to San Francisco&rsquo;s South of Market neighborhood. You walk up to the second floor of the school, file into a glass-walled conference room overlooking a classroom, and take a seat alongside dozens of other parents who, like you, feel that public schools&mdash;with their endless bubble-filled tests, 38-kid classrooms, and antiquated approach to learning&mdash;just aren&rsquo;t cutting it.   At the same time, you&rsquo;re thinking: this school is kind of weird.   On one side of the glass is a cheery little scene, with two teachers leading two different middle school lessons on opposite ends of the room. But on the other side is something altogether unusual: an airy and open office with vaulted ceilings, sunlight streaming onto low-slung couches, and rows of hoodie-wearing employees typing away on their computers while munching on free snacks from the kitchen. And while you can&rsquo;t quite be sure, you think that might be a robot on wheels roaming about.

As if on cue, cavalcades of battered Ford Econoline vans grumble to the curbs, and the women jump in. It is the start of another workday for legions of New York City&rsquo;s manicurists, who are hurtled to nail salons across three states. They will not return until late at night, after working 10- to 12-hour shifts, hunched over fingers and toes.   On a morning last May, Jing Ren, a 20-year-old who had recently arrived from China, stood among them for the first time, headed to a job at a salon in a Long Island strip mall. Her hair neat and glasses perpetually askew, she clutched her lunch and a packet of nail tools that manicurists must bring from job to job. Tucked in her pocket was $100 in carefully folded bills for another expense: the fee the salon owner charges each new employee for her job. The deal was the same as it is for beginning manicurists in almost any salon in the New York area. She would work for no wages, subsisting on meager tips, until her boss decided she was skillful enough to merit a wage.

Do not go north of 47th Street. Do not go south of 61st Street. Do not go west of Cottage Grove Avenue.   These boundaries were fairly explicit, almost to the point of being an official university policy. The campus police department was not committed to protecting students beyond the area,2 and the campus safety brochure advised students not to use the &ldquo;El&rdquo; train stops just a couple of blocks beyond them unless &ldquo;traveling in groups and during the daytime.&rdquo;    What usually wasn&rsquo;t said &mdash; on a campus that brags about the diversity of its urban setting but where only about 5 percent of students are black &mdash; was that the neighborhoods beyond these boundaries were overwhelmingly black and poor. The U. of C. has, for many decades, treated Hyde Park as its &ldquo;fortress on the South Side,&rdquo; and its legacy of trying to keep its students within the neighborhood &mdash; and the black residents of surrounding communities out &mdash; has left its mark on Chicago.

But in the past five years, state health officials have declared epidemics of whooping cough twice &mdash; in 2010 and in 2014, when 11,000 people were sickened and three infants died. Now an analysis of a recent whooping cough epidemic in Washington state shows that the effectiveness of the Tdap vaccine used to fight the illness (also known as pertussis) waned significantly.

,114,Female,N00002858,43372,"Ros-Lehtinen, Ileana (Rep.) [R-FL27]","Ileana Ros-Lehtinen, United States Congresswoman - 27th District of Florida Dear Friends, On Sunday May 10th, we take a day to recognize, honor and celebrate mothers and their constant and relentless commitment, love and support. On this special day, let us take the opportunity to honor all those amazing mothers in our lives and reflect on how their passion and drive have influenced each of us, as well as our communities across the nation. Mothers play many important roles throughout our lives as our teachers, comforters, friends, and our most arduous and steadfast supporters. Mothers grant the gift of life and then spend a lifetime showing each of us how to live life to the fullest. This Mothers Day, I especially remember my own mother, Amanda or Abu Mandy as we came to call her, for her extraordinary kindness, dedication and devotion to our family. My mother was a loving wife and an exemplary Mom who taught my brother and me to work hard and always make time for family and friends. As a Member of Congress, I am inspired to carry on Abu Mandys legacy of hard work and dedication by working with my colleagues to help strengthen families in our South Florida community. I have worked with both Republicans and Democrats to draft and pass legislation, such as the Every Child Deserves A Family Act which would help children in the foster care system by increasing their access to safe, supportive, and permanent homes by allowing a larger pool of loving parents to adopt. I was also an original cosponsor to a Congressional Resolution in support of National Adoption Month which calls for a revision of adoption policies in our nation in order to make it easier for loving and responsible parents to provide children in foster care with nurturing and loving families. I have also worked tirelessly across the aisle to address some of the main problems impacting women and mothers across our community and our nation. By cosponsoring the Womens Safety Act and supporting Congressional Resolutions condemning domestic violence, I have continued to work to raise awareness of the devastating impact of domestic violence on individuals, families, and our community. However, awareness is not enough. I am committed to supporting programs designed to end domestic violence in our nation. I was also an original cosponsor of the Human Trafficking Prevention, Intervention, and Recovery Act, The Human Trafficking Detection Act and other solutions that seek to protect women and children in our community from the horrors of human trafficking. These initiatives would enhance our ability to detect and rescue victims, punish traffickers and provide training to local law enforcement officials on the front line of this struggle. This Mothers Day, let us pause to honor and remember all the women in our lives who have cared for and loved us, believed in our callings, and pushed us to be the best that we can be. For my part, I will continue to support mothers and strong families across South Florida. Thank you to all the mothers and grandmothers who have impacted our lives in more ways than we can ever express.

[R-UT]","US Senator for Utah, Mike Lee [image = Putting Utahns in Control of Environmental Conservation!* One of the great triumphs of the so-called environmental movement was the passage of the Endangered Species Act (ESA) in 1969. But in the subsequent decades, the ESA has done more to inhibit economic activity, undermine local conservation efforts, and commandeer private property, than it has done to protect endangered species. Few understand this better than the citizens of southwest Utah. In 1974, the federal government listed the Utah prairie dog as an endangered species under the ESA, granting the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service regulatory control over all land containing Utah prairie dog habitat, much of which is found in and around Cedar City. The prairie dog population boomed as a result of their new protected status, which made it illegal  punishable by hefty fines and even jail time  to harass, harm, hunt, wound, kill, or trap the Utah prairie dog. The species was later reclassified to ""threatened,"" but the federal government continued enforcing its harsh penalties. And so the prairie dogs continued to multiply under the armed guardianship of Fish and Wildlife agents. The population was recently estimated to exceed 40,000. While the prairie dogs have never had it so good, the consequences of their proliferation have been devastating to the residents of southwest Utah. Last November, a U.S. District Court in Utah upheld a challenge to the federal government's authority under the Commerce Clause to regulate the habitat of the Utah prairie dog. This decision  the first of its kind in a federal court  was a welcome development, but for local officials, it is not a permanent solution. That's why I recently introduced in the Senate, along with Senator Orrin Hatch, the Native Species Protection Act, which would clarify that the federal government has no regulatory jurisdiction over a single-state species.

[link 2]* As a United States Senator, I have the privilege of nominating young men and women in Utah to attend our nations distinguished service academies.

In an unprecedented year, 20 students whom I nominated were appointed by an academy and will be attending West Point, the Naval Academy, or Air Force Academy.

[R-MO4]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email   About Me  | Contact Me  | Serving You  | Media Center  | Legislative Work  | Our District  | Resources  Dear Friend, The weather is warming up and it is abundantly clear that Spring has definitely sprung in Missouri! I enjoyed the warm weather and warm smiles as I traveled around Missouris Fourth District this week. This week was National Small Business Week   a week designated for celebrating the enormous economic contributions of entrepreneurs and small business owners across the country. Missouri is home to over 500,000 small businesses which employ over 1.1 million people  . We are blessed to have so many of these enterprising companies. One of those businesses, Burr King Manufacturing  , a family-owned business in Warsaw, has been making quality, American-made de-burring equipment since 1951. The company moved from California in 1995 after the owner had gone on a fishing trip and fell in love with the area, people, and business-friendly atmosphere of Missouri. Currently, Burr King has 23 employees creating quality products for use around the world. This is a shining example of the value a small business can bring to a community. I wish these great folks continued success in the future.  President Don MacCarthy gives Vicky a tour of the facility and a close look at one of the grinding machines Just north of there, in Lincoln, I had the opportunity to visit Wenig Custom Gunstocks  . The 18 employees here create custom gunstocks for the everyday sportsman to Olympic Gold Medal Champion Trap Shooters. As an enthusiast and ardent supporter of Second Amendment rights, I appreciate the special role they play in shooting sports and was impressed with the craftsmanship and quality.  Congresswoman Hartzler inspects the craftsmanship of a custom gunstock with Wenig owner Bobby Chambers In addition to being Small Business Week, it was also Teacher Appreciation Week. As a former teacher, I always enjoy visiting the schools in the district and meeting with those who are doing the noble work of educating our nations future. I got to meet a number of those great teachers when I visited the State Fair Community Colleges Career and Technology Center. As a former vocational teacher, I understand the importance of technical education to students and the economy. The Career and Technology Center is providing cutting edge training in needed fields like welding, health occupations, building trades, early childhood careers, machine tool technology, and graphic design. I commend these teachers and the quality education they are providing area students. I also had the privilege of visiting with 5th and 6th grade students at the Mill Creek Upper Elementary School in Belton this week. The school was named a 2014 Missouri School of Character  , an award for having reached a standard of excellence in the area of character development. These students model the character traits of integrity, honesty, responsibility, and courage, among others. Their lives encourage positive attitudes and positive academic results in the school. They are to be commended for their example.  Congresswoman Hartzler presents Mill Creek Upper with a proclamation congratulating the school for being a 2014 Missouri School of Character. Pictured with 5th and 6th grade Character Council members, Principal Kim Mauck (left of Congresswoman Hartzler), and Assistant Principal Deanna Feedback (to Principal Maucks left). On a different note, I recently announced the prestigious appointments of seven young Missourians to our nations Military Service Academies. Kelly Blunt from Warrensburg, Kelsey Elbel from Holden, and Benjamin Harris from Peculiar received appointments to the United States Air Force Academy; Chase Freidel from Moberly and Caleb Lucero from Columbia received appointments to the United States Naval Academy; and Nathan Kreher from Warrensburg and Graham Ratermann from Columbia received appointments to West Point.  Congresswoman Hartzler with some of the 2015 Service Academy appointees. Pictured (left to right): Chase Freidel, Caleb Lucero, Congresswoman Hartzler, Kelsey Elbel, Kelly Blunt I applaud the decisions of these young men and women to use their gifts and talents to serve their country. I congratulate them on their appointments and offer them my best wishes and prayers as they begin an exciting new chapter in their lives. More photos of the appointees can be found on my Flickr page here  . I was also happy to announce that Ms. Eva Marlin of Marshfield is this years winner of the Congressional Art Competition for Missouris Fourth District. Her piece, And the Sun Came Out to Dry Me  was chosen as the winner by our distinguished judge to represent the 4th District by being displayed in the Capitol tunnel in Washington, DC for a year. Twenty-one other impressive works from around the district vied for the honor. I hope Eva and all the students who took part in the competition will continue to use their gifts and talents to impact others through art. For more photos of the artwork and the artists, visit my Flickr page here  .  Congresswoman Hartzler (right) with Eva Marlin (left) and her winning artwork, And the Sun Came Out to Dry Me Lastly, this past Thursday marked the 64th Annual National Day of Prayer  . To mark the day, I visited South Haven Baptist Church in Belton to speak at a special gathering of dedicated folks from around Cass County who care about our country and believe in the power of prayer. Prayer is an act of faith that has unified us as a nation since its origin. Despite our differences, prayer can bring us together in one voice to overcome the challenges that we face. America has been made great through the prayers of her people.  Click to play video I pray that His mercy continues to make the United States, and the Americans who call her home, a unified, shining example for the rest of the world. Have a great week.

In the House, we are working hard to pass bipartisan legislation to help small businesses grow and thrive. In the first 100 days alone, we passed bills to ease the regulatory burden, provide much-needed tax relief, restore the 40-hour work week under Obamacare, and more. If we are to build a healthy economy and create good-paying jobs, it will be because of the creativity, innovation, and determination our nation's small businesses.

It began last weekend when I was honored to present the Congressional Gold Medal to Colonel Johnnie Pantanelli for her 71 years of service in the Civil Air Patrol. What a role model for service to our nation!   To promote Small Business Week, on Wednesday I toured ReEnergy in Lewis County which has a very important economic impact by creating jobs in the North Country. Thanks to the ReEnergy team for the great tour.  >From there, I hosted a ""Coffee with your Congresswoman"" event in Lowville and had the opportunity to talk to constituents about casework, agriculture, Fort Drum, education, economic development, 2nd Amendment, and transparency in Congress. Thanks to the 30+ folks who turned.  Afterwards, I toured Double Play Community Center and spoke to teachers and students about my work in Congress. And then I stopped by RBI Bats in New Bremen to promote job creation and manufacturing in New York!   On Thursday, I participated with Assemblyman Ken Blankenbush in a roundtable and a tour at Carthage Hospital to learn about the facility and their unique partnership with Fort Drum. Thanks to the hospital staff, board members, leaders, physicians and nurses for their commitment to the highest quality of care.  To continue promoting Small Business Week, I decided to stop by Anastasia's Bakery in Madrid to commemorate Anastasia's one year anniversary of starting her business. She is an example of how young entrepreneurs are helping to jumpstart our local economy.  >From there, I visited Curran Renewables in Massena and took a tour with Pat and Kelli to discuss ways we can continue to promote job creation and economic development.  Then I had the opportunity to deliver the keynote speech at the Massena Chamber of Commerce dinner to talk about commonsense ideas for economic growth and my commitment to fighting for North Country small businesses in Washington. There was a great turnout and it was wonderful to see the award winners recognized for their success!  On Friday, I toured Alcoa's Massena Operations which is the longest continuously operating aluminum facility in the world. Alcoa in Massena is an incredibly important employer and I am working to help protect and strengthen Alcoa's future in the North Country. I also had the opportunity to visit with the United Steelworkers Chapter 450 and hear about their dedication to ensuring we continues to create jobs and economic opportunity.  >From there I headed to visit and tour the New York Power Authority in Massena. I was in awe of the size and scope of the facility.  To continue promoting North Country small businesses, I headed to Main Street on Lake Placid to visit several of the local businesses and do some shopping as well.  >From there I had a productive meeting with the New York Olympic Regional Development Authority to discuss bringing the Olympic games back to New York.  And finally, this morning I had the honor of delivering the commencement address for the graduating class of 2015 at Paul Smith's College in Franklin County. I challenged the graduates to be brave with their ideas and their voices as they embark forward in their lives. Luck favors the brave!

This weeks District Work Week coincided with National Small Business Week and I took the opportunity to visit small businesses across PA-06. Thank you to all constituents who took the opportunity to stop by our East Greenville Community Office Hours on Thursday. Finally, I want to wish my mother, my wife Christine, and all the moms out there a very Happy Mothers Day! District Work Week: May 2- May 8, 2015 PA-6 Jobs Tour This week I embarked on a PA-06 Jobs Tour, visiting with lots of employers around our district. It also marked National Small Business Week and I made it a point to also connect with several innovative small businesses in PA-06. I always appreciate the opportunity to visit with our area entrepreneurs and to hear how I can promote legislation in Congress that will spur economic growth. Some of my stops included: * The Berks-Mont Business Association breakfast for a legislative update. We discussed regional transportation issues as well as how the Affordable Care Act is impacting our local small businesses. Thank you to the Reading Eagle for covering the breakfast meeting.  * A visit to Fidelity Technologies for a Q&A with their employees. Fidelity, headquartered in Berks County, is a leading global supplier of defense and aerospace products and services. * A tour of Carpenter Technology Corporation, Berks County's third-largest employer and a leading producer of specialty steel products that are on aircraft ranging from Wright Brothers-era planes to the space shuttle. * A stop on Main Street in East Greenville to recognize Mike Reck, who has owned and operated his barbershop for 55 years. I also want to take the opportunity to congratulate a local entrepreneur, Joe Zidik, the CEO of Custom Milling & Consulting in Fleetwood. In the coming weeks, Joe will be recognized as Eastern PA Small Business Person of the Year by the Small Business Association. Were grateful for his hard work and dedication to his employees and I applaud him on his achievements! I appreciated the opportunity to talk with employees at these businesses and many more. As always, if you'd like me to visit your business, please call my West Chester office at 610.696.2982 Supporting our Local Healthcare Providers This week also marked National Nurses Week, and I took the opportunity to visit with several healthcare providers in PA-06. As a Member of the Congressional Nursing Caucus, I want to acknowledge and express my appreciation for the commitment and hard work of nurses across our congressional district. Earlier this year, I was pleased to join in a bipartisan letter of support for Nursing Workforce Development Programs. On Thursday, I visited Paoli Trauma Center, which is the only Trauma Center in Chester County. The Level II center, which opened in October 2010, provides around-the-clock neurosurgical, orthopedic, surgical specialty, and intensive care services. With the healthcare industry being as fluid as it is, visits to centers such as the one in Paoli are extremely informative for me. The more I know, the more effective I can be as a legislator. Thank you to the Daily Local News for covering the tour and discussion.  On Friday, I joined emergency responders at Western Berks EMS in unveiling and demonstrating an automated LUCAS CPR device. Western Berks EMS is purchasing the devices thanks to a $105,000 federal Assistance to Firefighters Grant administered by the U.S. Department of Homeland Security. The LUCAS Chest Compression System is a safe, efficient tool that will ensure the same high-quality care is provided to all patients. I am a proud advocate in Congress for the Assistance to Firefighters grants because I believe an investment in our EMS providers is an important investment in ensuring our local communities remain safe. As a member of the Congressional EMS Caucus, I will continue to making sure EMS personnel have the resources needed to serve their communities.Thanks to the Reading Eagle for covering my visit with the Western Berks EMS.   Additional medical groups I met with throughout the week included: * Berks Cardiologists to directly hear about issues that are affecting the delivery of quality cardiovascular care. * Local pharmacists with Managed Healthcare Associates to talk with them about how we can better serve the aging population in long-term care facilities, including nursing homes. I want to thank all of our healthcare providers in Southeastern Pennsylvania for their desire to advance medical innovation and for their steadfast dedication to patients in our communities. Raising Awareness for Preeclampsia On Thursday, I joined with three other Members of Congress in a Twitter Town Hall hosted by the Preeclampsia Foundation. Each year, between 5-8 % of pregnancies in the U.S. are affected by preeclampsia. In recognition of May as Preeclampsia Awareness Month--the month we thank our mothers--it is important to know the warning signs and the facts to know how to respond. As an MOC, I am advocating for increased and stable NIH funding & support for HR 1209: Improving Access to Maternity Care Act. #PreAM15   Rep.

The legislation requires the president to submit a final deal with Iran  to Congress before reducing or removing sanctions imposed on Iran. It will now be voted on by the U.S. House of Representatives. A nuclear-armed Iran is a danger not just to the Middle East but to the peace and security of the entire world. Giving the Senate and the House oversight on this agreement is absolutely essential to the American people. We must be the eyes, the ears and the conscience of the people we represent. Balanced Budget For the first time in more than a decade, the Republican-controlled Senate took action this week to put our nation on track for a better future by passing a 10-year balanced budget. Washington should follow the example of Americas families and the middle class who manage their budgets in a responsible way.  The newly enacted budget, which does not require the presidents signature to take effect, calls for saving more than $5 trillion over 10 years and paves the way for the Republican Senate and House to send legislation that repeals and replaces Obamacare to President Obamas desk. Trade Means Jobs for Georgians Last week, I had the honor of delivering the Republican Weekly Address. I spoke about the positive effects trade has on our state and the impact of passing Trade Priorities and Accountability Act of 2015  . Passage of this legislation will help promote American workers and American jobs.  This legislation requires the president to consult with Congress before final approval of any trade agreement. It does not guarantee approval of any proposed trade agreement, but allows every trade agreement to be scrutinized by your representatives and senators. Importantly, it also ensures that trade agreements cannot override U.S. law. Enactment of responsible trade legislation will strengthen the U.S. against competitors like China and will allow us to negotiate fair trade agreements that protect American workers, farmers, and manufacturers. Fighting for Our National Defense On Tuesday, I joined several of my Senate colleagues in supporting efforts to prevent the Air Force from retiring the A-10  . Last week, the House voted to keep this close-air support platform in our arsenal and next week, the Senate Armed Services Committee will take up the same issue. Divesting this aircraft without a qualified replacement would severely jeopardize the safety of our men and women in uniform who rely on the A-10s close-air support capabilities.  The A-10 is an important mission at our own Moody Air Force Base in Valdosta, Ga., and plays a crucial role in support of our national defense. The close-air support provided by the A-10 is unmatched by any other aerial platform, and to stop flying this aircraft without an alternative ready and in place would put U.S. troops at an increased risk. Open Office Day On May 18, 2015, my field representative Daniela Belton will hold an Open Office Day in Butts County  . Open office days make sure that the views, concerns and local efforts of all Georgians are reflected in the operation of my office. Belton will be at the city of Jackson Municipal Court from 11:00 a.m. until 1:00 p.m., and I encourage everyone in the area to come and talk with her about any issues concerning the federal government, federal legislation or federal agencies. Please check my website  for opportunities in your area. Small Business Week  It is National Small Business Week, and I was honored with the Sm  all Business Council of Americas 2015 Congressional Award  on Wednesday for my work on behalf of small businesses.

,114,Male,N00032441,43529,"Nugent, Richard (Rep.) [R-FL11]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email  News from Representative Richard Nugent  Dear Friends, Just a quick follow-up update this week on Iran. As you all may have seen, the Senate passed their version of the Iran deal oversight bill by a vote of 98-1. The one ""no"" vote came from my recent former colleague Tom Cotton. His argument was that the bill should take the form of an actual treaty. Frankly, if it were a treaty, it would not give the House an opportunity to vote, only the Senate. In my opinion, having both chambers' members on record and accountable to their constituents is appropriate, so I can live with that. In short, the bill provides Congress, and through them the American people, a vote on whether or not to actually lift the sanctions once the nuclear deal with Iran is signed. It also would require the Administration to regularly certify to Congress that Iran is complying with the terms of the agreement. In both cases, the bill accomplishes important things. As we discussed in the last letter on Iran, one of the main concerns is that while Iran's leaders could simply issue a decree restarting their nuclear activities, re-imposing the sanctions would require an act of Congress, a signature by the President, and then a wrangling of our allies to do the same. There is also a substantial concern that Iran is going to strongly resist being open and forthcoming when it comes to the ongoing inspections of their facilities. It goes without saying that they haven't exactly been open and transparent in the past. There are some concerns that the bill should have been stronger. For instance some Republicans wanted to include a provision requiring Iran to acknowledge Israel's right to exist. Why other members of the Senate would object to that, I don't know, but the final bill did not include this or other amendments that some of us favor. This is a classic example of not letting the perfect be the enemy of the good. What we have here is Congress cobbling together a veto-proof majority restricting the President's ability to act unilaterally. Given the concerns about this President's (and all presidents) desire to expand the office's power, seeing Congress stand up for itself as an institutional check on the presidency is indeed a welcome step. And while I would sincerely hope to see more of this kind of bipartisan check on a whole range of issues, it is especially important that partisanship stop at the water's edge. When it comes to national security, we can't be putting party politics ahead of what's good for the country. It shouldn't happen ever, but it certainly shouldn't happen on matters of war and peace. Every time Congress allows a president to get away with something, that precedent continues for future presidents. At the end of the day, as with the budget, this is the first time since I came to Congress that I've seen the institution stand up and assert itself in a unified fashion. We've got a long, long way to go before we can all stand up and say what a great job Congress is doing, but this is clear and unequivocal progress. That, my friends, is a positive. I'll have more to report next week as the House moves to consider the annual Defense Authorization bill and potentially some other items as well - including the Iran bill. In the meantime, if there is anything you all need, I hope you will let me know. Thanks again and enjoy the rest of the weekend.

I can say without hesitation that I would not be where I am today without the guiding hand of my mother, Frances Scott. She worked 16-hour days as a single mom to keep a roof over our head and food on the table, and for that I can never really thank her enough. She sacrificed so much of herself for my brother and me, and I am truly in awe of her strength. Perhaps even more importantly from my view, she did not give up on me - even when I had given up on myself. Failing multiple classes in 9th grade, cutting up in class, focusing too much on football and not enough on academics - it didn't matter, because she knew that there was more potential in me than I could see at the time. And I think that speaks to what we all can see in our mothers - that their unbridled optimism, not for their own lives, but for their children's lives, can lead to amazing things. I take that message with me as a public servant, and I will continue working to build an even better America for our kids and grandkids than we have today. Happy Mother's Day to my mom, and all the moms across our great nation who are working, guiding, teaching, disciplining (something I also know well!), and showing their families the definition of strength, dedication and love.

[R-GA9]","Congressman Doug Collins Dear Lindsey,  This Administration refuses to tell the truth about Islamic terrorism, but Sister Diana Momeka, an Iraqi Christian, will -- now that John Kerry's State Department is allowing her to visit the United States. [link 1] A week ago, it appeared that might not happen in time for the human rights leader to join her delegation on a trip to Washington, D.C.  Of all of them, including Shiite and Yazidi representatives, the Christian was the only member whose application for a travel visa Kerry's agency denied. State Department bureaucrats, essentially calling her a liar, claimed Sister Diana was a risk to overstay her visa, although she is in the exact same position as the others, victims of ISIS, who received permission to visit the U.S. International organizations and members of Congress have endorsed the sister's trip and are anticipating her arrival.  This week, I sent a letter to Secretary of State Kerry and appeared on radio [link 3] and in print [link 4] to force the government to reverse its terrible decision. My campaign exposed its double standard and yesterday led to the news that the State Department finally approved Sister Diana's visa.

[image =  *Small Business Week Visits*  Last week, I celebrated National Small Business Week by visiting two Seventh District Small Businesses: *Heritage Community Bank [link 1]* in Hartsville andRogers Brothers Farm Peanut Processing Facility in Lydia. I thanked each business for the ongoing efforts to grow our local economy and improve our community.  At Heritage Bank, we discussed Dodd-Frank regulations impeding their ability to lend. We discussed a situation involving a local church that has been active in the community for more than 50 years. The congregation has nearly paid off the existing mortgage on the church building and wanted to use the building as collateral in order to build a newSundaySchool facility. Federal regulations put in place by the FDIC require the church to get both buildings appraised as one new unit, which forces the church to pay a 15 percent mortgage downpayment on both units-- the existing church and newSundaySchool building. This regulation makes it incredibly hard for churches, community centers, and businesses to expand. Frankly, these regulations make little sense. I plan to meet with the American Bankers Association and my colleagues on the bipartisan Problem Solvers Caucus to see what we can do legislatively to repeal these regulations and free up our community banks ability to lend.

In my life, I have been blessed with an absolutely wonderful mother and mother-in-law. My mother Ruth Trousdale taught me at a young age the value of a hard days work and the importance of family. While working long hours at our familys small business and then returning home to care for our family, my mom showed me what it meant to be a multitasking mother in a fast paced world. She showed me that its possible to be strong and independent, while also giving her children the greatest gift of all: unconditional love. I could never begin to repay her for everything that she has done for my brother, my sister, my children and me.  My mother-in-law Loretta Wagner is a hero of mine for her commitment to the pro-life community and her endless dedication to the unborn. When fighting for the pro-life causes in the U.S. House of Representatives, I often think of her and her uncompromising support for life at its earliest stages. Ray and I have been very blessed to raise our family with her constant support. I am incredibly fortunate to have these two empowering women in my life to lead by example and show me what it means to be a good mother and wife. I hope that my children have learned as much from them as I have and I try every day to share the same type of unconditional love they have shared with me. To all of our mothers, I wish you a happy Mothers day. And for everyone else out there, I am sure that like me, you have a special mother or two in your life. I hope that you take today and every day to thank them for all that they have done and show them how much you care. May you have a happy Mothers Day and God bless our moms!

Across our state there are exceptional women  mothers, wives, daughters, aunts and friends  who are central to our families and communities. In recognition of just how fundamentally important as these women are, I wanted to take a moment to update you about important work in Congress that will benefit the women in our lives. Trends show that across our state and country, families increasingly rely on more than one income and many mothers are a part of todays workforce. Unfortunately, as a country we still see that women are paid, on average, 77 cents for every dollar a man earns for the same work. I believe all workers deserve fair compensation for their work product and I support making certain that women are not subject to this kind of discrimination. That is why I have once again cosponsored the Paycheck Fairness Act, which ensures that women are paid the same amount as their male counterparts for the same work. This is an important bill that will promote economic opportunities and security for women and their families. Whether youre gathering with family today, resting, or thinking about great memories of your mom, I hope you all have a Happy Mothers Day! Please keep those moms who are serving our country overseas in your thoughts and prayers.

I hope this newsletter provides a good overview of my work, and I hope that you will share it with your friends, family, and neighbors. Have a very happy Mother's Day and a great week!  Drug Abuse Task Force    On Friday, I had the honor of welcoming the Office of National Drug Control Policy Director Michael Botticelli to Lexington for a roundtable discussion at the Lexington Hope Center. We had a productive discussion about the challenges facing central and eastern Kentucky families and communities because of the growing drug epidemic, especially the rising abuse of heroin. Following the roundtable, I invited the participants to join the Sixth Congressional District Drug Abuse Task Force, an effort I am spearheading to bring stakeholders together, improve communication, and to get advice and counsel on federal policy from those on the frontlines. Click here to learn more about the Drug Abuse Task Force  , or read some of the media coverage of this event from the Lexington Herald-Leader  , cn2 Politics  , or WKYT  . Around Kentucky  During the district work period I enjoyed meeting with Kentuckians across the district while Congress was not in session.  I met with Berea Police Chief David Gregory (top) who showed me the department's new zero-emission, battery-powered motorcycle. I participated in a town hall meeting for senior citizens in Berea (bottom, left). I also hosted a town hall meeting focused on agriculture in Irvine (bottom, right)  We had a great turnout for Breakfast with Your Congressman at Michael's restaurant in Ravenna (top). And I enjoyed meeting with seniors at the Rose Mary C. Brooks Place in Winchester. Honoring the Sanders-Brown Center on Aging  Last week, I spoke on the House Floor in recognition of the good work being done at the University of Kentucky Sanders-Brown Center on Aging. Their work is critical because with the aging of the population worldwide, age-related cognitive disorders such as Alzheimer's disease are reaching epidemic proportions requiring a desperate need to identify strategies for effective treatment. Click the image above to watch a video of my speech. Investigating Terrorist Financing   The House Committee on Financial Services recently held its first hearing of the Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing. The threat of terrorism is continually evolving, with an increasing number of groups around the world threatening the United States and its allies. Many of these groups are utilizing diverse methods to generate and move funds to support their activities and organizations. This hearing focused on the major terror groups currently operating across the globe to obtain an overview of the terrorist threat and methods of terror financing.

[R-CO4]","  Home  About Ken  About Our District  News  Contact  Weekly Newsletter Dear Friend, If you or a family member is seeking a military academy nomination, you can find more information and the application here  . Members of Congress can nominate candidates for appointment to four of the five U.S. service academies: U.S. Military Academy (USMA), West Point, NY; the U.S. Naval Academy (USNA), Annapolis, MD; the U.S. Air Force Academy (USAFA), Colorado Springs, CO; and the U.S. Merchant Marine Academy (USMMA), Kings Point, NY. During my week in the district, I met with education and business  leaders to discuss issues they face every day, including how government overreach affects their daily lives. Back in Washington, I am working with  Congressman Scott Tipton (R-CO) to secure $2 million in funding for the Arkansas Valley Conduit.This project was authorized in 1962 to bring clean drinking water to 40 communities in southeast Colorado, many of which are in violation of clean water standards because of naturally occurring elements. I spoke in favor of Congressman Tipton's amendment on the House floor  . This project would be an investment for our children and grandchildren. I joined Dan Caplis on 710 KNUS to provide an update  on my work in Washington. I discussed my recent vote for the Death Tax Repeal Act.  This so-called estate tax hurts the economy and families who have worked hard to build up their own businesses. We also discussed the continued Iran negotiations. I disagree with the deal and the way the President is handling the negotiations. I do not believe in negotiating with Iran, even though the President has taken Iran off the State Department's list of state sponsors of terror, because I still consider it a terrorist state. Dan asked about legislation we passed out of the Judiciary Committee, which makes changes to the Patriot Act. The bill would prohibit the federal government from collecting metadata in bulk. It would also require the federal government to use narrow terms that identify a specific individual when requesting data. These are much needed reforms to preserve our Fourth Amendment rights. There are some other constitutional protections that I would have liked to see, but they were voted down in the Judiciary Committee because some members do not believe an amended bill can get through the Senate. We should not reauthorize the Patriot Act in its current form, and the legislation we passed out of the Judiciary Committee is a step toward meaningful reform. I'm also working with several of my colleagues to call for the end  of the Export-Import Bank of the United States. The level of corruption and fraud at this Bank is alarming and unacceptable. As a prosecutor, I saw many instances of bribery, fraud, and corruption. It is disappointing that the words I once used to describe white collar criminals can now be used to define a federally funded entity.

Passed shortly after the September 11, 2001 attacks, the Patriot Act, specifically Section 215, granted federal agencies, including the National Security Agency, increased surveillance powers to prevent additional terrorist attacks. Some Americans have concerns that the Act does not sufficiently protect our privacy, while others argue that surveillance is necessary in order for the government to effectively investigate terrorist threats. Legislation introduced in both the House and the Senate, entitled the USA Freedom Act [link 1], would reauthorize Section 215 until December 31st, 2020, with one key reform: the bill would prohibit the indiscriminate bulk collection of metadata from domestic phone companies, while maintaining the ability to conduct surveillance beyond our borders.

[R-TX4]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email  News from Representative John Ratcliffe   About  Contact  Issues  Media Center  Services        _____  _____ Hi friend, Happy Mother's Day! I thought that you would find this opinion piece that I recently wrote for the Herald Democrat interesting. It's important that issues like this get attention because they can have drastic impacts on the lives of all Americans.  By John Ratcliffe Special to the Herald Democrat It turns out that 1977 and 2015 have more in common than we previously believed. In 1977, President Carter established the definition of a floodplain as an area that is subject to a 1 percent or greater chance of flooding in any given year. Fast forward to January of this year when President Obama used Executive Order 13690 to arbitrarily changed this definition so that it would better align with his administrations climate agenda with flexibility for bureaucrats in Washington rather than American families. Whats the big deal about the president indiscriminately changing the definition of what constitutes a floodplain? Its a bigger deal than you might think. If you live near almost any kind of waterway, near a valley, a river or in a current floodplain you will more than likely be affected by this expansion of government. Millions of Americans live in floodplain areas  including a large percentage of the constituents in the 18 counties that I represent. Under these new rules, much of Grayson County will be saddled with an expanded floodplain designation and the onerous regulation that follow. Living a floodplain carries with it a number of restrictions that can be crippling for economic and community development. A floodplain designation could increase the area that falls within the protection of the Endangered Species Act and Clean Water Act permitting under the controversial Waters of the U.S. rule. Investment in these areas can dry up as it becomes so cost prohibitive to build or modify a structure. These new rules will increasing the already confusing regulatory burden on housing, roads, bridges, veterans facilities, Army Corps projects, small businesses and farms. For example, imagine you own a home and are currently not in a flood zone. When the Executive Order goes into full effect and your home is now in a floodplain you will be subjected to a number of new federal rules and regulations that will have extra costs associated with them. Structural repairs to bridges that span the Red River will more than likely need to be extended or upgraded if they are found to be out of compliance for these new rules, costing taxpayers significantly more money. The floodplain will likely expand around Lake Texoma which could include increased construction and permitting costs for new projects.  Yet again, the president has used his pen and his phone to implement far-reaching policies developed behind closed doors without stakeholder input from governors and mayors, which is required by law. Even worse, there was no public release of the cost benefit analysis of these new regulations. I have assembled and am leading a coalition of 54 of my colleagues in Congress to fight back against the Presidents overreach. On April 21, our congressional coalition officially put the President and his Administration on notice and is demanding an explanation about the impact of these standards and the legality of this executive order. Requiring clarification from the President is just the first step in fighting back. We are currently requiring the Administration to show that they complied with government rulemaking requirements and give a full explanation of how these alternative standards have been developed, including the scientific basis. My goal here is not to be an alarmist. Its simply to highlight the fact that a seemingly harmless executive order that most people have never heard of can result in far-reaching costs that hard-working taxpayers in Texas are ultimately forced to bear. In the course of my job as your representative, the issues I frequently engage on are many of the same ones you hear about the news each night  health care, immigration, border security, tax policy, and terrorism. While Im honored to have a seat at the table to tackle these important issues, we cant lose sight of the less visible, but equally important infringements of our liberty that often go unnoticed. Sometimes its the little things which have the largest impact on our daily lives. We need more transparency in government, not less. I came to Congress to have a seat at the table on issues that are important Americans across the fourth district of Texas. This is an issue that will have a significant impact on our communities and it is important that your voice is heard. The residents of Grayson County deserve answers, and Im championing the effort to make sure we get them.

This year in particular, I also want to wish a very, very happy FIRST Mothers Day to my beautiful wife, Anna. You may recall that when you last heard from me, Anna and I were anxiously awaiting the arrival of our baby boy. Well, I am thrilled to announce Gabriel Cotton arrived on April 27th shortly before 10:30 P.M.weighing in at eight pounds and four ounces. Both mom and baby are doing wellGabriel has even been letting us get some sleep!and these past two weeks have been nothing short of perfect. Anna and I are very appreciative of all of your well wishes and your prayers. Between newsletters, dont forget to follow me on Twitter  or like my Facebook  page for daily updates! As always, please do not hesitate to contact me if you have any questions or concerns, or simply want to express your opinion. Im always happy to hear from you. Best regards,  Tom Cotton Preserving Access to Community Pharmacies  This week I joined West Virginia Senator Shelley Moore Capito in introducing legislation to help preserve senior citizens access to the prescription drugs and important healthcare services provided by community pharmacies. The Ensuring Seniors Access to Local Pharmacies Act of 2015 would require that community pharmacies in medically underserved areas (MUAs), medically underserved populations (MUPs) and health professional shortage areas (HPSAs) be allowed to participate in Medicare Part D preferred pharmacy networks if they are willing to accept the contract terms and conditions of existing preferred providers. The bill will give seniors more choice, allow community pharmacies to compete and preserve access to medical services in underserved areas. Local pharmacies play a critical role in rural states like Arkansas where larger, chain pharmacies can often be hours away. But many of these local pharmacies are struggling to keep their doors open because pharmacy benefit managers refuse to include them in their coverage. This bill would allow smaller pharmacies in Arkansas and across the country to accept the same contract terms as larger, in-network pharmacies. Rest assured, I will continue to fight for access to quality medical care in Arkansass rural communities. Preventing a Nuclear Iran This week, the Senate considered the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act. I believe that a nuclear-arms agreement with any adversaryespecially the terror-sponsoring, Islamist Iranian regimeshould be submitted as a treaty and obtain a two-thirds majority vote in the Senate as required by the Constitution. President Obama wants to reverse this rule, requiring opponents to get a two-thirds vote to stop his dangerous deal. But Congress should not accept this usurpation, nor allow the president any grounds to claim that Congress blessed his nuclear deal. Thats why I opposed this legislation. I will work with Republicans and Democrats to stop a dangerous deal that would put Iran on the path to obtaining a nuclear weapon.  Keeping America Safe Soon, Congress will have to act to reauthorize some of our most important counterterrorism tools, the Business Records provision of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act. First enacted in 2001 as Section 215 of the USA PATRIOT Act, this provision provides the Intelligence Community with the authority to collect metadata associated with phone records. As a member of the Senate Intelligence Committee I have carefully studied the NSA metadata program, I remain steadfast in my support for this program. It is an integral tool in our fight against terror and to protect Americans. This week, I joined several of my colleagues on the Senate floor to discuss the importance of this program. Click here  to watch a video of my remarks. Around Arkansas In late March, Lt. Col. Robert L. Hite of Camden, Arkansas passed away at the age of 95. A former POW, Lt. Col. Hite was among the airmen who helped carry out the Doolittle Raid, a low-altitude bombing attack on Japans home islands. He served 40 months in a Japanese prison after he was captured in 1942. Lt. Col. Hite died earlier this year at the age of 95. On April 18th, he was posthumously awarded the Congressional Gold Medal of Honor. Recently, I spoke on the Senate floor in memoriam of Lt. Col. Hite. I was honored to pay tribute to an Arkansas war hero. Click here  to watch the full video of my remarks.

To date, more than 300 constituents have written to me, sharing some eye-opening stories on hours-long commutes, crumbling bridges, and unsafe transit. Together, they've made it clear that the time for long-term infrastructure solutions is now. I'm preparing a report to send to leaders of Congress on the infrastructure challenges we face and the urgent need for repair. If you haven't yet, take a moment to share your story on how inadequate infrastructure has impacted you and your family  Over the past month, hundreds of constituents have written to my office on the impact inadequate infrastructure has had on their community. I've brought those stories to the House floor in order to highlight the need for long-term investment and repair that brings our infrastructure up-to-speed. Delaney shares constituent stories on the House floor  Recently, I came to the floor to share the story of Magnus, a constituent from Hagerstown who hears about fatal accidents along I-81 so often, that he calls it ""Death Valley"". In addition to creating safety concerns, underdevelopment makes it difficult for Magnus and other professionals in the area to move equipment and act on business opportunities. This week, I invited Magnus and several others to join me for an Infrastructure Roundtable in Frederick  to share their stories in person. My roundtable hosted constituents from across the district, who, like Magnus, saw the impact of inadequate infrastructure on a day-to-day basis.

,114,Male,N00027462,43461,"Bilirakis, Gus (Rep.) [R-FL12]","Supporting small businesses and patients with neurological diseases!     facebook  twitter  you tube  5/10/2015 Small Business Development Week  Here in Florida, we have 2.1 million small businesses, representing nearly 99 percent of all employers. These small businesses employ more than 42 percent of the states private-sector workforce. Small businesses play a significant role in our states economy. Small businesses, in addition to providing tremendous practical benefits  employment, economic prosperity, and the like  in many ways, represent the American dream. Being your own boss; coming up with an idea, and being able to turn that idea into a successful, marketable product or service; creating something of your own  that is the American dream. Sadly, this Administration has been supporting outdated, 20th Century policies that focus on a top-down, Washington-centric economic plan  a plan that has failed middle class Americans. For the first time since researchers began documenting it 35 years ago, more American businesses are closing than opening. America has now ??fallen out of the top 10 countries when it comes to the creation of new companies. We need to focus on a bottom-up, Main-street focused economic approach that empowers middle class Americans and working families. My focus is on small businesses like PharmaWorks, a small business in my district that has 89 employees. I was happy to tour their facility and discuss their issues.  Rep. Bilirakis meets with PharmaWorks employees to discuss issues facing small businesses Neurology Roundtable  Rep. Bilirakis hosts a Neurology Roundtable to discuss cures and treatments for neurological diseases This week, I had the opportunity to host a Neurology Routable in my district. I was joined by neurologists, patients, and family members to discuss steps needed to advance the research and development of treatments and cures for Parkinsons, Alzheimers and ALS. It was wonderful to see how many people came to the roundtable to join in the discussion. I will continue to support those struggling with these chronic and rare diseases, and work towards finding better treatments and cures. I look forward to more conversations with my constituents to discuss how we can identify solutions for the millions of Americans whose lives are affected with these diseases. In addition to local events like this one, I am continuing to work on behalf of chronic disease patients in Washington. I am the Co-Chair of the Parkinsons Caucus, and I am an original cosponsor of a provision in the 21st Century Cures draft bill  which would create a national data collection system for neurological diseases, including Parkinsons disease. Better data would pave the path to better treatments. Why It Matters  The 21st Century Cures Initiative will save lives. Better cures and better treatments matter.

Bilirakis talks to students about the importance of education As we celebrate Teacher Appreciation Week, I am so grateful for the wonderful teachers working in Pasco, Pinellas and Hillsborough counties. I've personally witnessed their hard work and tireless efforts through my own children's experiences and as I have visited many schools throughout the district. It is too often a thankless job, and yet the work that is being done every day to ensure that future generations are prepared for the challenges of tomorrow is nothing short of miraculous. I would like you to join me in offering a heartfelt thank you to all the dedicated teachers and support staff of District 12. You are making a lasting and positive difference in our community by improving the life of a child. National Charter Schools Week  Rep. Bilirakis meets with students at a local charter school to discuss the importance of school choice This week was National Charter Schools Week, and I was able to visit Plato Academy in Tarpon Springs. Parents should be given the option to choose the school that best fits the needs of their child, and gives the student the best opportunities to learn and succeed. It was wonderful to meet the students of Plato Academy Tarpon, and I wish them success in all that they do. No Illegal Bailouts   I have been firmly anti-bailout. I voted against the 2009 bailout, and now, taxpayers are at risk again. The risk corridor program is supposed to ensure that insurance companies wont go out of business due to the Presidents health care law  or, in common terms, a bailout. In the past, I supported a provision now signed into law that ensures that taxpayer money cannot be used to bailout tax payers. In 2013, I questioned then-Secretary Sebelius  about risk corridors. If the insurance companies suffer because of the Presidents health care law, I will continue to work to ensure taxpayers are not on the hook.

[R-IL15]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this e-mail  News from Representative Shimkus  Biography  Constituent Services  Legislation  Newsroom  Contact Me      May 10, 2015 Dear Friend, This week I want to update you on an issue that is important to our state and that I've made one of my Environment & Economy Subcommittee's top priorities  : the Yucca Mountain Project. Over 30 years and $15 billion has been spent to research and develop Yucca Mountain into a permanent, central repository for our nation's spent nuclear fuel and defense waste. It's important that we move this material to a secure location rather than allow it to continue piling up at more than 100 sites around the country. This is especially important in Illinois, where 9,630 tons of spent nuclear fuel is stored across the state.  The federal government's failure to take control of nuclear waste not only costs taxpayers nearly a billion dollars each year  in lawsuits, it unnecessarily risks accidents and creates a tempting target for terrorists. In Illinois and across the country, many of the sites where spent nuclear fuel is currently stored are near population centers and water supplies. Yucca Mountain, on the other hand, is on a restricted plot of federal property larger than the entire state of Rhode Island. As you can see from the summit of the mountain in the picture below, this remote location is surrounded by desert and adjacent to the Nevada Test Site, where over a thousand nuclear bombs were detonated during the Cold War. No other location in the U.S. makes more sense to host a permanent repository.  The science says Yucca Mountain makes sense too. Earlier this year, the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) released their completed Safety Evaluation Report on the facility. This independent review concluded that Yucca Mountain meets the safety standard for storage of nuclear waste for up to one million years. So what's the hold up? Well, decades before that independent safety evaluation was completed, Nevada politicians opposed to the project funded their own studies and paid their own experts to show the Yucca Mountain site was unsafe. Unlike the independent scientists and professionals from the Energy Department and the NRC who studied the mountain for decades, these state-funded experts sought to advance the preferred political narrative of the day rather than conduct an unbiased scientific review. The fear-mongering they facilitated has persisted ever since. Today, however, support is growing in Congress to move forward with the project and some Nevada leaders have expressed a willingness to find ways to end the stalemate. To build on that support both in Congress and the state of Nevada, I led a bipartisan congressional delegation  to Yucca Mountain last month (below).  Touring the site, 90 miles from Las Vegas, gave my colleagues the opportunity to take in just how remote the Nevada National Security Site is and why it's an ideal place to build this national asset. More pictures, video and information from the trip is available HERE  . Thanks for reading and have a Happy Mother's Day!

[R-OH14]","Congressman David Joyce Hello, Last November, the American people spoke loud and clear that they wanted Congress to take the lead to start solving our nation's problems. They were sick of the inaction and they wanted Congress to get things done. Well, I certainly listened and have been working with my colleagues to get results. Here's a look at what we've accomplished in our first few months of Congress - **14**: That's how many years it has been since Congress passed a budget that balances without raising taxes on Americans. - This week, when the Senate passed our Conference Budget, we officially set a new milestone. - **62**: That's the number of bills we've passed out of the House. - That's more than double the 25 bills we passed in the first 100 days of 2013. - **8**: That's how many of these bills that have gone on to pass the Senate. - Not only that, all 8 of those bills have been signed into law. - **1974**: That's the last time Congress has started the Appropriations process this early. - **2**: That's the number of Appropriations bills we have already passed out of the House. As a member of the Appropriations Committee, I am particularly proud that we've been able to put our head down and get these bills passed. This progress has led to one of the most productive first 100 days under Republican control in modern history. That's something I'm proud to be part of. *Mother's Day* I want to wish a Happy Mother's Day to all of the hardworking mothers who sacrifice to make life better for their children everyday. I hope you have a great day, you deserve it.  [image = I work hard every day to serve and represent you to the best of my ability and will continue working for solutions in Congress.

[R-IA3]","News from Iowa Congressman David Young  Home  About Me  Media Center  Services  Contact  Friends, This week was National Small Business Week and I used this opportunity to visit with small businesses in Iowa's Third Congressional District. Truth be told, every week should be small business week, because they are really the life blood of our towns and cities.  WHERE I WENT... I held a Small Business Roundtable in the East Village of Des Moines. Nearly 20 small business owners gathered to tell me what is working and what is not working for their businesses.  My visit to shops in Emerson, Mills County, was cut short by rain, so we went to the Emerson Community Center to talk about the challenges folks on Main Street are facing.  I visited stores in Adel, Dallas County, to hear what small business owners are talking about.  I toured Katecho, Inc. in Des Moines, and learned about the challenges that the company faces when the federal government gets in the way.   WHAT I LEARNED...  I heard a reoccurring message all across southwest and central Iowa this past week. Iowa job creators want a level playing field and they want certainty. They want certainty in the tax code by making it permanent. They want a dose of Iowa commonsense and reality when it comes to the seemingly endless stream of rules and regulations that can strangle job creation and growth. Representing you in Washington is an honor and a privilege - one that I take very seriously. I could not do it without you. Enjoy the rest of your weekend, I hope to see you soon!

The rate of economic growth was a paltry 0.2 percent for the first three months of 2015, adding to concerns that a lasting rebound is still far from reality. *Consumer Confidence Drops* The discouraging report seemed reflected in consumer confidence, which dropped significantly in Gallups most recent U.S. Economic Confidence Index. The survey averages the publics views on current economic conditions and future outlook. It found that a majority of Americans think the economy is getting worse. It is easy to understand why public optimism is fading, even before the sluggish first-quarter economic numbers. Unemployment, stagnant wages, and more demands on family budgets have left many Americans questioning their own economic stability and future. A different Gallup poll recently revealed that fewer Americans now consider themselves part of the middle class. Homeownership  a pillar of the American Dream  is at a 25-year low.  *Budget Could Boost Growth by $400 Billion* Republicans in Congress are working hard to put policies in place that support an enduring economic resurgence.The House and Senate have passed the first 10-year balanced budget plan since 2001.Unlike the big-government budget proposed by President Obama, this plan reins in federal overspending while creating more opportunities for Americans.The Congressional Budget Office (CBO) estimates that Republicans budget could increase economic growth by more than $400 billion over the next decade.The impact in Mississippi could lead to more than 10,000 new jobs. As a member of the Senate Budget Committee, I was directly engaged in the budget process from start to finish. I served as a conferee on the bicameral committee that reconciled differences between the House and Senate budget resolutions.I also authored several provisions, including a requirement for long-term CBO estimates on major spending legislation. With the federal debt at a staggering $18 trillion, Americans are looking for solutions that promote accountability and transparency.A balanced budget is an important first step toward putting the country on a trajectory of growth instead of insolvency.By setting spending guidelines, it lays down parameters for the Senate Appropriations Committee to allocate federal funds in its annual bills.Sen. Thad Cochran, the committees chairman, has pledged to restore regular order to the appropriations process  allowing every lawmaker the opportunity to take part in the tough spending decisions that need to be made. *Focusing on Job Creation* The jobs report on May 8 showed a slight improvement in hiring after a major slowdown during the winter months. The labor force participation rate, however, remains near its lowest level in almost 40 years. This statistic reflects the number of working-age Americans who have a job or are actively looking for one. The fact that it has stayed under 63 percent for the past year suggests that many people are still discouraged by the labor market. Legislation that prioritizes a healthy economy would send a powerful signal to American workers. I am encouraged that Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell (R-Ky.) is committed to bringing job-creating bills to the Senate floor. After years of weak economic numbers, Americans are ready for positive news. Contact Information: Website: Washington, D.C.

I am forever grateful to my mom for the hard work and sacrifices she made to raise me and my seven brothers and sisters. I am also wishing a happy Mothers Day to my wife of almost forty years, DeaNa, who continues to be an amazing mom to our two children and grandmother to our grandchildren. I hope that you are able to honor today with a special mom in your life! A Grateful Nationand World As a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee  , I have an opportunity to help reaffirm important ties with our NATO allies and to closely examine developments in Europe and the Middle East. This past week, I was with some of the men and women who are stationed overseas to serve our nation, and also to take part in a D-Day celebration in the Czech Republic thanking American soldiers for their role in WWII.  Eating lunch with U.S. Army soldiers in Romania, a vital base between the U.S. and Middle East operations. The Pilsen Liberation Day  , celebrated every year in the small city of Pilsen in western Czech Republic, celebrates the day that General Patton led a liberation army in to free the country from Nazi occupation. Their theme this year is Thank You America for the American soldiers who put their lives on the line to free this small country from Nazi control.  I joined the Pilsen Liberation Festival in laying wreaths and saluting the new memorial to U.S. General Patton in the Czech Republic. Celebrating Teachers and Small Businesses This past week was both National Teacher Appreciation Week and National Small Business week! Having spent twenty years as a volleyball coach at Appleton East High School, I have seen up close the power of great teachers and the impact of a great education on young people. Now that I am serving in Congress, I visit a school either in person or via Skype at least once a month, and am consistently impressed with the hardworking men and women who are dedicated to shaping young minds. Thank you to all of our excellent teachers!  Skyping with a social studies class at Hortonville High School this past week. Education and the potential for hard work to lead to a family business are underpinnings of the American Dream, and nowhere more so than in northeast Wisconsin. Our small businesses are a dynamic, growing sector of our economy and our community, and I am proud of their efforts. Thank you for the hard work you put in every day! You can check out some of my small business visits here  . If you didnt get a chance to thank a teacher or shop locally with a small business during the week, I would encourage you to do so!

This year we had a great showing from veterans who attended the Fair and learned about the number of resources they have available to them.

While there I provided an update on the House's work and Washington and took questions from the Rotarians in attendance. That afternoon, I visited with leaders of the Greater Gaston Development Corporation. We had a great conversation about growing businesses in Gaston County and ways that the federal and local government can work together to improve the business climate in our area. I concluded my day in Gaston County by visiting the soon to be opened Ole Dallas Brewery in Dallas. I toured the main brewery, which is currently under construction and then visited their beer garden at Sims Park. Starting this season Ole Dallas will serve as a sponsor of the Gastonia Grizzlies. Tuesday I was in Hickory to speak at the Catawba Chamber of Commerce's Legacy Leadership breakfast briefing. While there I spoke about Congress' work in Washington and took questions from the audience. Wednesday I was back in Catawba County, beginning my day by meeting with members of the Catawba County Board of Education. I spoke with the Board about what is new in Catawba County Schools and discussed ways that I can be of assistance to our local teachers and students. Following the meeting with the Board, I had the pleasure of visiting one of Catawba County's great high schools, St. Stephens. While there I visited the school's robotics class and observed the students work. Later that afternoon I met with the leadership team of Newton's People's Bank to learn about the pressures they face as a small financial institution in the current regulatory climate. Thursday I visited the Catawba River Antique Mall in Belmont.

Along with bringing together the trucking industry, the New Mexico Trucking Association also held a job fair aimed at hiring Veterans the day prior. ""This organization has my full respect for both their vital role in the American economy and also for their dedication to get Veterans hired. Not only do they provide goods to New Mexicans and beyond, but they also pay special attention to improving their communities,"" said Pearce. Congressman Pearce first met Johnny Johnson, Managing Director for the Association, during an event in Carlsbad last September hosted by Truckers Aganist Trafficking. ""I appreciate being able to speak to this group of individuals who have decided to vigilantly fight human trafficking both here in New Mexico and throughout the country. It is not a topic that many people want to talk about, but the fact is that America faces a serious human slavery problem today. These men and women have decided to stand together and not let this tragedy continue, and for that I give them the highest respect and gratitude.""

,114,Male,N00035346,43683,"Carter, Buddy (Rep.) [R-GA1]","Monday, May 4, 2015: What a weekend! While I normally go home after votes are completed on Fridays, I delayed going home this weekend until Saturday afternoon so that I could greet the Honor Flight participants from Savannah and Brunswick who arrived Saturday morning. The Honor Flight network is a non-profit organization created to honor Americas Veterans for their sacrifices. It is made up of volunteers who bring WWII and Korean War veterans to Washington, DC, to view the WWII and Korean War Memorials. This was without question one of the most rewarding experiences of my life. We arrived at the WWII memorial at 8:30 a.m. with our hand-made signs reading Thank you for your service and Welcome to Washington, D.C. With a light breeze blowing the cherry blossoms through the air and perfect temperatures, the only thing more beautiful than the weather was the look on the veterans faces as they arrived to the cheers of grateful Americans. School groups, marching bands and an honor guard were on hand to greet our heroes. Former Senator Bob Dole (R-KS), himself a WWII veteran, sat in a swivel chair and greeted each veteran personally as they entered the Memorial. I have never been involved in a more patriotic celebration before. What an honor! Monday begins with a ribbon cutting for the new Military Resource and Veteran Services Center at Armstrong State University (ASU). ASU has always supported our veterans and this new center will provide support services to the over 1,000 military-affiliated students on campus. Next, we head over to the Armstrong Center where I am hosting my first Veterans Services Forum with experts from Veterans Affairs (VA) offices from across the region as well as Veterans Service Organizations and other non-profits dedicated to serving our heroes. The forum is a great success thanks to the hard work of our staff and provides veterans an opportunity to meet with health professionals and others who can help them navigate the VA. Later in the afternoon, I head down to Brunswick to participate in the groundbreaking of the Mariner Village residence hall on the campus of the College of Coastal Georgia. This private-public partnership is another example of the fine work being done at our higher education facilities across the state and particularly in Brunswick. Tuesday, May 5, 2015: Im in Pierce County near Offerman this morning to participate in the grand opening ceremony of the Southern Ionics Mineral Sand Plant. This multi-million dollar investment will create over 140 jobs in the area and provide a great boost to the economies of Pierce and Wayne Counties. Former Congressman Lindsay Thomas, who has been intricately involved in this project, serves as the emcee of the event and does a great job. Afterwards, I head to Blackshear to tour Sundance Boats, a small boat manufacturer that employs over 50 people. The ingenuity and work ethic of many of these small businesses always amazes me and Sundance Boats is certainly a great example of both. Later, I head to Pierce Timber Company, another great Pierce County business, to meet with my friend Hugh Thompson and discuss issues affecting the timber industry. After completing a radio interview with the Atlanta Journal Constitution, I head to Ludowici in Long County for their annual Law Day celebration where they are unveiling a portrait of long time Sheriff Cecil Nobles. As family and friends share stories of one of the longest serving and most beloved Sheriffs in Georgia history, it reminds me of the lasting impact one person can have on a community. Wednesday, Mary 6, 2015: I stay closer to home today as I visit my alma mater, Robert W. Groves High School in Garden City to discuss school food programs and child nutrition reauthorization. I have the opportunity to meet with students and staff as well as some of the area farmers to discuss school lunches and learn what the challenges are in providing our students with nutritional lunches. As a member of the Committee on Education and the Workforce, it is important for me to experience this first hand as we will be reauthorizing this program in the near future. Somewhat to my surprise, and certainly to my delight, I learn that for the most part the students are quite satisfied with their choices for lunch. After our meeting I have the opportunity to join six students for lunch in the cafeteria and enjoy a meal of glazed chicken, mixed vegetables, and a trip through the well-stocked salad bar furnished by a public-private partnership. Interacting with these impressive young people and learning of their future plans and dreams reassures me that our country will continue to be in good hands. While things have certainly changed at my alma mater since I was a student here many years ago, it still brings back fond memories of friends and teachers. Next, we head to Shuman Elementary in Savannah where we observe the students during their lunch and speak to them about their experiences with their garden where they grow some of the vegetables that they have available for lunch. One of their many fine volunteers, former Harlem Globetrotter Larry Gator Rivers who is celebrating his birthday today, joins us in our tour of the garden and shares stories of the students experiences in the garden. Afterwards, I head to our district office on Abercorn Street where I have a series of meetings with constituents before heading to a tour of the Strength of Nature facilities in Savannah. This phenomenal company produces beauty products to people of African descent that are sold around the world and employs over 250 people in our area. Thursday, May 7, 2015: Im in Riceboro today to tour the facilities of SNF Holdings and learn more about one of Liberty Countys largest employers and the products that they produce. Employing over 1,000 people and providing products such as water-soluble polymers for wastewater treatment plants throughout the world, this privately owned company is one of our areas finest manufacturers. Next, I head to Jesup where I have the opportunity to speak to the local Rotary Club, after which I travel to Long County High School for a tour of their school and to speak to a government class. Heading back to Savannah, I stop by Walthourville for a tour of Carpethia Paws, a volunteer organization that tries to save stray animals in Liberty County. Later, after attending the National Day of Prayer event in Pooler, I visit with a group of Vietnam Veterans from across the country who are in Savannah and being hosted by former Mayor Herb Shaw from Jesup. Friday, May 8, 2015: Im in Waycross today and begin the day with a meeting with Paul Smith, the Ware County Manager. Next, I meet with the new CEO of the Mayo Clinic in Waycross, Dr. John Presutti, before heading to the Waycross-Ware County Public Library where I present them with a U.S. Flag that we flew over the U.S. Capitol on their behalf. Before heading home, I have the honor of participating in the graduation ceremony at South Georgia State College, formerly known as Waycross College, which one of the fine institutions of higher education in our district and state.

Cramer Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email   About Kevin  | Services  | Media Center  | Legislation  | Contact Me  | Subscribe  May 11, 2015 Newsletter _____  Congressman Cramer meeting with BNSF Officials at the Heimdal, ND Train Derailment May 6, 2015 Press Release CRAMER STATEMENT ON HEIMDAL, ND OIL TRAIN DERAILMENT First, we should all say a special prayer of thanks no one was injured as a result of this derailment and fire. I would like to commend the professionalism and dedication of all of the first responders helping deal with this accident. I have met with federal, state and local officials on scene as well as representatives from BNSF. I am satisfied all which can be done is being done to deal with this accident and its immediate impact on surrounding communities. I will continue to monitor the situation and ensure this remains the case for anyone affected by this accident. Sadly, North Dakota is becoming all too familiar with the scenes of oil car derailments but it is important to remember no amount of regulations will realistically prevent accidents from occurring. Accidents will happen even if no one does anything wrong or improper. Our continuing need to ship crude oil across the country highlights the importance for more pipelines to safely carry crude oil from the Bakken region in North Dakota. ### _____  CRAMER DENOUNCES EWG DISTORTED ATTACKS ON CROP INSURANCE  WASHINGTON, D.C.  Today Congressman Kevin Cramer made the following comments concerning the recent Environmental Working Groups (EWG) report on planted prevention more commonly known as crop insurance. EWGs attack on farmers continues with their latest report on crop insurance. The EWGs report uses cherry picked data to fit their pre-determined conclusions in an attempt to eliminate the crop insurance program. North Dakotas producers would much rather be producing crops than depend on crop insurance. The insurance only helps them survive until the next year. Farmers in North and South Dakota should not be penalized because of the abnormally wet weather cycle in recent years. They work very hard to produce the food needed to feed a growing world. _____  Cramer Statement on Joint US/Canadian Revised Rule for High-Hazard Flammable Trains  WASHINGTON, D.C.  Today, Congressman Kevin Cramer released the following statement after the U.S. Department of Transportation (DOT) released the revised rules for flammable liquid rail car safety. ""It was encouraging to see both the United States and Canada work together in light of the interconnected nature of our two economies. The new safety requirements outlined today by the DOT provide a sensible approach to dealing with older outdated rail car designs, which I hope will lead to improved safety. However, it is important to remember no amount of new regulations will realistically prevent accidents from occurring. Our continuing need to ship crude oil across the country highlights the importance for more pipelines. During my call with Secretary Foxx last week, I stressed the importance of giving the rail industry adequate time to implement these new safety rules and work with local governments to protect the public while ensuring the rail industry continues to meet Americas diverse shipping needs,"" said Cramer. Cramer went on to say, ""We need to learn more about the cost benefit analysis associated with the ECP braking systems. If shipping costs increase, what affect will it have upon the overall operations of the railroads and will those increased costs force people to utilize other transportation options such as increased use of trucks. When considering this rule, safety doesnt begin and end at the railway track Regulations which force shippers to use different transportation options could have many unintended consequences."" Congressman Cramer is Co-Chairman of the Congressional Northern Border Caucus. The caucus brings together House Members from states bordering Canada to discuss issues of benefit for both countries.

Today, Congressman Kevin Cramer joined a majority of his colleagues on the U.S. House of Representatives Energy and Commerce Committee to favorably report H.R. 2042, the Ratepayer Protection Act, a bill he helped introduce as an original cosponsor to the whole House. This legislation protects electric consumers from the potential rate increases and reliability risks resulting from the Environmental Protection Agencys (EPA) Clean Power Plan for existing power plants. The unilateral disarming of the U.S. economy by the EPA is not a good climate change strategy. The Clean Power Plan will increase family, business and industrial electricity rates which will raise the cost of everything we produce, manufacture and grow in this country, making us less competitive in the global marketplace. In addition, it puts the reliability of our electrical transmission and distribution grid in great peril with no replacement for traditional base load generation. Furthermore, this rule tramples on the constitution by forcing states to comply with emission standards arbitrarily set by the federal bureaucracy, said Cramer. _____  CRAMER APPLAUDS PRESIDENTS DECISION TO OVERTURN DOE ON GRID ENABLED WATER HEATERS  WASHINGTON, D.C.  Today, Congressman Kevin Cramer made the following statement after President Obama signed S. 535, the Energy Efficiency Improvement Act. This legislation protects Grid-Enabled Water Heaters from U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) regulations ultimately benefiting electric utility customers in North Dakota. The bill was passed without any opposition in both the U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate before going to the President. Congressman Cramer co-sponsored legislation in the House to overturn the DOEs regulations (H.R. 906  ). ""President Obamas decision to overturn his own department's regulations is significant. The Department of Energys misguided attempt to ban electric grid-enabled water heaters, some of which are manufactured in North Dakota, would prevent utilities from managing load peaks and saving customers money. It was the right decision for consumers and the electric industry to sign this legislation into law. I look forward to working with the President in the future on areas of agreement on energy issues , said Cramer. _____  CRAMER - HOUSE PASSES FY2016 MILITARY CONSTRUCTION &  VETERANS AFFAIRS APPROPRIATIONS  $7.3 million for Air National Guard Intel Targeting Facilities in Fargo  WASHINGTON, D.C.  Congressman Kevin Cramer made the following statement after the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs Appropriations bill for Fiscal Year 2016. H.R. 2029 provides a total of $76.6 billion in discretionary funding for Department of Defense construction, the Department of Veterans Affairs, and related agencies. The legislation includes $7.3 million for Air National Guard Intel Targeting Facilities in Fargo. This appropriation fulfills our commitments to veterans with improved health care, cracks down on the corruption and abuses by the VA and provides our military with the improved facilities they need to protect our freedoms at home and deter our enemies abroad. HR 2029 ensures North Dakotans serving in the armed forces and veterans receive the resources and benefits they earned, said Cramer. _____  CRAMER: HOUSE PASSES BUDGET - ROADMAP TO BALANCED BUDGET  AND FISCAL SANITY  WASHINGTON, D.C.  Today, Congressman Kevin Cramer joined a majority of his colleagues in the U.S. House of Representatives and approved the conference report to S. Con. Res. 11, the Congressional Budget. This final bill is the result of weeks of work between members of the US House and US Senate to balance the budget within 10 years while not raising taxes, rebuilding and strengthening our nations defense, protecting our nations most vulnerable citizens, improving economic growth and opportunity for all hardworking Americans and finally limiting out-of-control federal spending. ""While it is not perfect, this budget is our roadmap to bringing fiscal sanity to Washington DC. It is incumbent upon Members of Congress to remain committed to the spending limits and goals laid out in this resolution. This process will force us to examine the size and role of government needed to meet the priorities of our country. I look forward to this discussion with my colleagues and people of North Dakota,"" said Cramer. _____  Cramer - House Passes FY 2016 Energy and Water Appropriations  WASHINGTON, D.C.  Congressman Kevin Cramer released the following statement after the U.S. House of Representatives passed the Energy and Water Appropriations Bill. H.R. 2028, the Fiscal Year 2016 Energy and Water Appropriations bill, which provides a total of $35.4 billion in discretionary funding for nuclear weapons activities, the Army Corps of Engineers, the Department of Energy, and related agencies. The legislation includes $786,000 in Army Corps Investigations Feasibility money to study Red River basin wide flood protection solutions and $16.684 million for Army Corps operation and maintenance funding for facilities in North Dakota including Garrison Dam and Baldhill Dam. It also includes $25 million for ND Bureau of Reclamation facilities including Garrison Diversion and Heart Butte Dam. The bill includes language to prevent the Army Corps of Engineers from spending any funds to implement the ""Waters of the United States"" (WOTUS) rule. It would have drastically expanded the EPAs and Army Corps of Engineers authority over bodies of water including small ponds, creeks, ditches, and other occasionally wet areas, including those found on private property. _____  Cramer Stands Up for Religious Freedom and the First Amendment WASHINGTON, D.C.  Today, Congressman Kevin Cramer joined his colleagues in the US House of Representatives to reaffirm and restore Religious and First Amendment constitutional freedoms in the District of Columbia by passing H.J. Resolution 43. The resolution of disapproval sponsored by Rep. Diane Black prevents implementation of the Reproductive Health Nondiscrimination Act  (RHNDA) in Washington. RHNDA could restrict First Amendment freedoms by (1) forcing churches, non-profits, and businesses to make personnel decisions inconsistent with their sincerely held religious beliefs or moral convictions with regard to the sanctity of human life; or (2) mandating those entities provide health insurance coverage for abortion. ""RHNDA is a clear attempt by the D.C. Council to target groups with the audacity to support rights for the unborn. Our Constitution guarantees the liberty of all Americans to practice their particular faith. No governmentfederal, state, or localshould have the power to violate the deeply held religious beliefs and first amendment rights of free Americans,"" said Cramer. RHNDA was adopted by the D.C. City Council late last year and transmitted to Congress on March 6 for a Congressional review period of 30 legislative days. The law will be enacted at the expiration of the 30 day period unless a joint resolution of disapproval is enacted. On April 21 H.J. Res. 43 was approved by the House Oversight and Government Reform Committee on a vote of 20-16  . _____ Congressman Cramer Around the State Town Hall Meeting with Bottineau area Veterans   _____ North Dakota National Association of Insurance and Financial Advisors meeting in Jamestown  Click on Picture for a story from the Jamestown Sun  on this event _____ Talking with Students at Red River High School in Grand Forks  _____ Roundtable with Grand Forks Business Leaders  _____ Touring Avianax Lab in Grand Forks  _____ University of North Dakota School of Medicine and Health Sciences Building  Beam Signing  Click on the Picture above for a WDAZ TV  Story on the visit _____ Foster Grandparent/Senior Companion Program Recognition event in Grand Forks   _____ North Dakotans in Washington DC   Visiting with Close Up High Scholl students from White Shield and Hettinger in Washington _____ Congressman Cramer In Committee  Congressman Cramer Debating H.R. 2042 a bill to roll back the EPA's Clean Power Regulation (Click on Image for Video of Congressman Cramer Discussing H.R. 2042) EPAs Pending Power Plant Rule Threatens Consumers Access to affordable and reliable electricity allows us to cool and heat our homes and powers our economy, but EPA is threatening to restrict access to affordable energy with its proposed regulations on power plants. Under EPAs proposed 111(d) rule for existing power plants, referred to by the agency as its Clean Power Plan, electricity rates are estimated to increase by an average of 15 percent in a majority of states  . These cost increases will hit low-income families the hardest and could lead to fewer jobs and lower wages. As a member of the House Energy and Commerce, Congressman Cramer argues in favor of H.R. 2042, the Ratepayer Protection Act, legislation empowering states to protect families and businesses from rate increases and EPA overregulation. _____  Congressman Kevin Cramer questions FCC Commissioners about transparency and management at the commission.

[R-AL1]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email  News from Representative Bradley Byrne  ABOUT BRADLEY  | HOW CAN I HELP  | NEWSROOM  | CONTACT BRADLEY  Friends, Did you know that there are an estimated 28 million small businesses in the United States? In Alabama alone, studies estimate there are over 70,000 small businesses. Right in here Southwest Alabama, there are small businesses on every street corner from Chatom to Gulf Shores. Last week was National Small Business Week, and all across the country small businesses were recognized for their contributions to our nations economy. In fact, 99.7 percent of all employers in the United States are small businesses. From our nations founding, small businesses have been the backbone of our economy.  In recent years, small businesses have unfortunately faced a number of new challenges. Since 2008, more small businesses have closed than have opened. Just as bad, last year the United States ranked 46th in terms of how easy it is to start a business according to the World Bank. As recently as 2007, the United States ranked 3rd. So what has changed? The answer most likely lies with the shockingly high number of regulations coming out of federal agencies in Washington. Ask any small business owner, and they will tell you that they are drowning in federal regulations and mandates. In 2013, all new federal regulations added up to $112 billion in net costs. Since I came to Congress over a year ago, I have made it a priority to visit small businesses firsthand and hear directly from the owners and the employees about how policies in Washington are impacting their business. Ive visited a scrap metal business in Monroeville that is struggling to comply with burdensome regulations from the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA). Ive also met with small medical practices in Baldwin County who are dealing with costly mandates brought on by Obamacare. In Washington, Ive tried to use these experiences to advance legislation that will get the government out of the way and empower small businesses to grow. Here's a look at some of the legislation I supported to help small businesses: * H.R. 527: Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act  - rolls back red tape and forces agencies to consider the impact regulations will have on small businesses * H.R. 636: Small Business Tax Relief Act  - gives small businesses much-needed certainty when it comes to the tax code. * H.R. 30: Save the American Works Act  - restores the 40-hour work week that has been destroyed by Obamacares employer mandate * H.R. 1105: Death Tax Repeal Act  - repeals the death tax which unfairly burdens small businesses with a costly tax when a loved one passes away We need to stop putting up barriers and instead increase opportunities for our nations small businesses. Its important that federal bureaucrats in Washington remember that they do not and did not build a single business. It is the American spirit and belief that anyone can achieve their dreams which have made our nation great. The American economy is strongest when small businesses are flourishing, and its time we put people before politics and work together to support our nations small businesses. National Day of Prayer Thursday was the National Day of Prayer, and I had the opportunity to attend the Mayors' Prayer Breakfast in Foley. This event is put on by a number of mayors in Baldwin County, and it offers a great opportunity to pray for our communities, the state, and our country. This year's ceremony also recognized Foley's 100th birthday and honored some of the oldest churches in Foley.  I spoke about how prayer has been an important part of our country since its founding. Our nation has always relied on prayer to help get us through difficult times and to thank our God for the many blessings that have been bestowed on us. It was a fantastic event, and it was great to see so many familiar faces. You can see more pictures from the event here courtesy of Gulf Coast News Today  . Congressional Art Competition Each year my office puts on the First Congressional District Art Competition. This contest is a great way to showcase the outstanding artistic achievements of students in Southwest Alabama. We had over 130 submissions in this year's contest, and all the art was display in the Mobile Museum of Art.  I want to congratulate Siobhan Johnson, a senior from St. Paul's Episcopal School in Mobile, who won first place for her artwork entitled ""Brotherhood's Past"" (pictured above). Her artwork will be displayed in the United States Capitol for the next year, and she will be invited to attend a special ceremony in Washington later this summer. I also want to congratulate our other winners: * 2nd Place: Grace Jeon, a freshman from St. Paul's Episcopal School * 3rd Place: Lillian Bower, a sophomore from Robertsdale High School * 4th Place: Andrew Zhang, a junior from Alabama School of Math and Science * Honorable Mention: Anna Alford from St. Paul's Episcopal School * Honorable Mention: Christopher Barbosa from Baker High School * Honorable Mention: Kirsten Lundy-Powell from Theodore High School * Honorable Mention: Madison Standland from Fairhope High School I want to congratulate these winners and all of the students who took part in the competition. Most importantly, I applaud all the students and teachers for their commitment to the arts. You can learn more about the contest by clicking here  . Service Academy Nominations One of the favorite parts of my job is being able to nominate young men and women to attend one of the prestigious service academies. As a Member of Congress, I have the opportunity to nominate students from the First Congressional District for appointment to the United States Air Force, Naval, Military (West Point), and Merchant Marine Academies  . The following students were accepted for appointments to U.S. Service Academies after becoming eligible for consideration through an official nomination from my office: * Noah Anderson, from Saraland High School, received an official appointment to the United States Merchant Marine Academy. He is the son of Kevin and Tammy Anderson. * Brewer Ayres, from Daphne High School, received an official appointment to the United States Air Force Academy. He is the son of James and Pamela Ayres. * Amanda Hall, from Mobile Christian School, received an official appointment to the United States Military Academy. She is the daughter of Theodore and Patricia Hall. * Michael Miller, from Murphy High School in Mobile, received an official appointment to the United States Military Academy. He is the son of Michael Miller Sr. and Lesha Miller. * Riley Nolan, from UMS-Wright Preparatory School, received an official appointment to the United States Military Academy. He is the son of Ben and Mary Nolan. * Isabel Perry, from Davidson High School in Mobile, received an official appointment to the United States Air Force Academy. She is the daughter of Brian and Misty Perry. * Chris Rose, from Spanish Fort High School, received an official appointment to the United States Naval Academy. He is the son of Donald and Cynthia Rose. * Slater Whiston, from St. Pauls Episcopal School, received an official appointment to the United States Air Force Academy. He is the son of Ed and Vanessa Whiston. These young men and women have demonstrated outstanding leadership qualities in the classroom and in their communities. The reason the United States is home to the greatest fighting force in the world is because our military is made up of great people. I am confident these individuals will add to that impressive tradition, and I applaud them for their commitment to serving our great nation. What's Ahead Next week I will be back in Washington to vote on a number of bills that are important to our national security. First, the House is expected to vote on the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)  , which passed out of the Armed Services Committee a few weeks ago. This bill is very important to our area and our nation, so I will be closely following the process closely as we consider a number of amendments. Last week, the Senate passed a bill to give Congress the power to approve or disapprove of any nuclear deal with Iran  . I believe this is critically important because I remain very skeptical about any ""deal"" that the Obama administration may come up with. Iran is no friend of the United States, and I hope the House acts soon on a bill to give us the authority to reject a bad deal. Additionally, it is possible the House will vote on the USA Freedom Act  , which is a bill that would end the bulk collection of Americans data while also improving transparency and strengthening national security. Finally, the House may vote on H.R. 36, the Pain-Capable Unborn Child Protection Act  . This bill would ban all abortions after 20 weeks. I am a co-sponsor of this bill and will support it should it come up for a vote. Needless to say, it is going to be another busy week in Washington. I hope you will follow along on Facebook  and Twitter  . Feel free to send me an email  or call my office at 202-225-4931 if you have any questions or concerns.

Can you believe that a federal regulation on church and civic highway signs has put our state at risk of losing its highway funding? I recently asked House Transportation and Infrastructure Committee Chairman Bill Shuster for a legislative fix to help Oklahoma churches and service groups keep their highway signs up. Acting under state law, some groups have erected highway signs but now face violation notices due to the size of those signs, which the Federal Highway Administration requires to be no larger than 8 square feet unless the organization has gone through a challenging permitting process. The Oklahoma Department of Transportation has more pressing infrastructure issues to deal with than limiting church and civic club signs to 8 square feet. And this is one of those things that makes you wonder if the federal government is focusing its resources--our tax dollars--on important priorities. It is my hope that language will be added into the long-term highway funding bill that will help our churches and service organizations. You can read more about the issue in my press release  .

Senator Collins Introduces Bipartisan Small Business Legislation and Honors Award-Winning Small Business from Maine  Senator Collins Honors Prudential Spirit of Community Award Winners  Senator Collins Questions Top Defense Officials on Navy's 30-Year Shipbuilding Plan  Meeting with Mainers WEEKLY COLUMN ""Recognizing the Next Generation of Leaders"" By: Senator Susan Collins One of the greatest privileges I enjoy while serving Maine in the United States Senate is the opportunity to meet outstanding young people from our state who have devoted part of their busy lives to carrying on Maine's strong tradition of community service. I always come away from these meetings inspired by their commitment and encouraged for the future of our State and our nation. I recently had the opportunity to meet two such remarkable young people - Meghan Charest of Falmouth and Kevin Ayotte of Madawaska - when they were in Washington to receive the 2015 Prudential Spirit of Community awards, which recognize students for exemplary community service. Although they have dedicated themselves to different types of civic involvement, Meghan and Kevin are united by a desire to make their communities better, to encourage others to get involved, and to grow personally from their experiences. >From nearly 20,000 nominees nationwide, only two students from each state are selected for this recognition. This year marks the 20th anniversary of the Prudential Spirit of Community Awards, the largest youth recognition program based entirely on community service, so it was a particular honor to congratulate these two young Mainers. Meghan, a 16-year-old junior at Falmouth High School, provides people in need in her community with fresh, organic produce through her community garden. After volunteering at the Falmouth Food Pantry and seeing how little fresh produce was available, Meghan was inspired to start her garden as a sustainable, effective way to provide healthier foods for the people using the food pantry. Her garden yields about 500 pounds of food per year. Working with the food pantry coordinators, Meghan researched which crops have high yields and found community members willing to donate space for a garden. Meghan then secured a grant to buy gardening equipment; and spoke at schools, Girl Scout meetings and civic clubs to recruit volunteers. She and her team went to work planting, watering, weeding, harvesting produce and making weekly deliveries to the food pantry. Meghan later enlisted the help of a master gardener who taught her more about growing healthy food. She moved her operation to a larger garden, and began using social media to recruit more volunteers. She also began raising money to maintain the garden by setting up fundraising tables at garden centers. Today, Meghan's garden is the primary source of fresh produce for the food pantry, which serves about 900 people in her community. Meghan said that organizing and working in the garden helped her ""realize the power, strength and grace that come with helping others.""

Senator Collins Hailed as a Champion of Bipartisanship and Compromise  Earlier this week, Senator Collins participated in a panel alongside former New Jersey Senator Bill Bradley and National Journal Senior Political Columnist and Editorial Director, Ron Fournier. The panel, ""Beyond Partisanship: Breaking Washington's Political Gridlock,"" was moderated by National Journal Contributing Editor and Columnist Norm Ornstein before an audience of one thousand members of the American Hospital Association. During the panel, Senator Collins discussed the importance of bipartisanship and compromise, and also her role in ending the 2013 government shutdown. Just days after Senator Collins' participation in the panel, she was featured in the Boston Globe where she was lauded as ""a catalyst for compromise.""  ""Maine's Susan Collins a Force for Consensus"" >From the Boston Globe  ""WASHINGTON - The Senate's first attempt at regular bipartisan lunches this year began with a telling choice: the tastes of Maine. ""The February menu featured lobster salad, wild blueberry pies, and the indulgence of Gifford's Ice Cream. The ingredients for this buffet of good will came from the home state of Senator Susan Collins, a Republican long known for her moderate views and willingness to find compromise.  Photo courtesy of the Boston Globe ""She seemed a fitting host for a new Republican-led Senate determined to rectify the dysfunction that has mired Congress. As senators struggle to pass even innocuous bills, Collins is emerging as a lifeline for moderate Democrats and a counterbalance to the GOP's right flank - a catalyst for compromise in a sea of intractable ideologies. .. ""And she has an opportunity this session to test her skill as a prominent dealmaker on challenging issues that range from raising the minimum wage to financing long-term repairs for the country's crumbling infrastructure.  ""'The Senate is supposed to be the greatest deliberative body in the world, and in the last two years, we don't seem to have done much deliberating,' Collins said in her Capitol Hill office, filled with home state mementos from her nearly two decades in office.

Senate Aging Committee Examines Ways that Technology Can Help Seniors Remain in Their Homes  - To watch this clip click here  or the play button above This week, the Senate Special Committee on Aging, led by Chairman Susan Collins, held a hearing titled, ""Aging in Place: Can Advancements in Technology Help Seniors Live Independently?"" The Committee examined how technological developments such as telehealth, electronic sensors, and medical alert devices have played a role in helping seniors to stay in their homes longer than they otherwise would have. Senator Collins invited Dr. Carol Kim, Vice President for Research at the University of Maine in Orono, to testify about the University's efforts on this topic. In the hearing, Senator Collins asked Dr. Kim where the University comes up with the ideas for the technology and products they are developing. In response, Dr. Kim shared a story about a group of students who met with residents at a local assisted living facility and in just one hour, were able to come up with a list of 50 products that would be helpful to the seniors in the community.  Senator Collins Introduces Bipartisan Small Business Legislation and Honors Award-Winning Small Business from Maine Leading into the Small Business Administration's (SBA) 52nd annual small business week, Senators Susan Collins and Bob Casey (D-PA) introduced bipartisan legislation known as ""The Small Business Tax Certainty and Growth Act."" This legislation would bring much-needed certainty back to the U.S. tax code, empowering small businesses with the predictability needed for growth by allowing small businesses to create and implement long-term capital investment plans. In addition, this legislation would lower the expenses associated with starting a new business and ease complex accounting rules and administrative burdens placed on small businesses. In addition to her bipartisan bill, Senator Collins joined with Senator Angus King to congratulate Loyal Biscuit Co., a small business in Maine, on their selection as the State Small Business Award Winner of 2015. This award, a part of U.S. Small Business Administration's (SBA) 52nd National Small Business Week highlights the impact and accomplishments of American small businesses. The Loyal Biscuit Co. is an award winning, family owned, dog and cat supply store with locations in Belfast, Camden, Rockland and Waterville.

Senator Collins Honors Prudential Spirit of Community Award Winners  This week, Senator Collins met with two students from Maine who are the recipients of the 2015 Prudential Spirit of Community Award. This year's winners are Meghan Charest, a junior at Falmouth High School, and Kevin Ayotte, an eighth-grader from Madawaska Middle/High School. This award is given to the top two youth volunteers from each state. Meghan is being recognized for her work helping to provide people in need with fresh, organic produce through her community garden. Kevin is being honored for his work performing a wide variety of important jobs for the Four Seasons Trail Association in Madawaska.  Senator Collins Questions Top Defense Officials on Navy's 30-Year Shipbuilding Plan  To watch this clip click here  or the play button above This week, Senator Collins questioned top Defense officials during a hearing about the viability of the Navy's 30 year-shipbuilding plan and the status of the DoD's current efforts to preserve a robust shipbuilding industrial base. Last month, the Navy presented its 30-year shipbuilding plan to Congress for fiscal year 2016. This annual long-range plan for construction of naval vessels calls for 308 ships over the 30-year period, however funding for Navy shipbuilding falls short of the plan's requirements. Based on the information provided in the plan, Senator Collins asked Defense Secretary Ashton Carter how the Department of Defense intended to ""preserve a robust shipbuilding industrial base"" that can meet our operational requirements across the globe. In response, Secretary Carter stated that ""one of the great strengths of our country is our ability to project power around the world. The Navy is an important ingredient of that."" The Secretary stated that U.S. ships have been able to ""dominate the naval commons"" because of the quality and size of our fleet. He recognized that ships, ""particularly ships of quality that are made at Bath.are not one year projects"" and require sustained long-term planning and funding. He emphasized the Department of Defense's commitment to maintaining a ""robust industrial base"" for our Navy to preserve this critical capability. To read the full press release click here  .  Meeting with Mainers Senator Collins always makes time to meet individually with constituents- either Mainers who are visiting Washington, D.C. or at home in Maine.

junior,"113,114,115",Male,N00033085,412573,"Cruz, Ted (Sen.) [R-TX]","May 8, 2015 Greetings, What we saw this week in Garland was a heartbreaking act of terrorism and it is a reminder of the continued threats we face. We are grateful for the heroic actions of law enforcement that thwarted this attack and prevented what could have been a terrible loss of life. But it underscores the need for vigilance. Keep Texas strong, Ted Cruz   Sen. Cruz Speaks on His Iran Amendment; Votes on Iran Nuclear Review Act Click to view video On Wednesday, Sen. Cruz asked for unanimous consent on his amendment, cosponsored with Sen. Pat Toomey, R-Penn., to the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act that would require affirmative Congressional approval of any Iranian nuclear deal before sanctions relief can occur. Sen. Cardin, D-Md., objected to his request. Our first priority should be stopping a bad Iran deal that jeopardizes the lives of millions of Americans and millions of our allies, Sen. Cruz said. There is nothing more important this body can consider, not trade, not the budget. There is nothing more important. The first responsibility of this body is to protect the national security of this country - to protect the lives and safety of men, women, and children across this country - and the President's Iran deal deeply jeopardizes the safety of Americans. Sens. Cruz and Toomey filed amendment #1152 in April.See the original release here. View Sen. Cruzs full remarks here. On Thursday, Sen. Cruz released the following statement regarding votes on the Iran Nuclear Review Act: This bill was a missed opportunity. If Congress had acted to defend our constitutional authority  if Congress had adopted the Cruz-Toomey amendment  then we would be able to stop a bad Iran deal. Instead, the odds are now overwhelming that under these ground rules President Obama will negotiate, and Congress will acquiesce to, a terrible deal that allows Iran to acquire nuclear weapons and will endanger the lives of millions of Americans and our allies. I voted no on cloture because we should have insisted on amendments to put real teeth in this bill. Ultimately, I voted yes on final passage because it may delay, slightly, President Obama's ability to lift the Iran sanctions and it ensures we will have a Congressional debate on the merits of the Iran deal. I will continue to lead the fight to prevent the Islamic Republic of Iran from acquiring nuclear weapons and to protect the national security of America and our allies. Sen. Cruz Praises Federal Court NSA Decision On Thursday, Sen. Cruz released the following statement regarding the decision reached on Thursday by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit about the National Security Agency's data collection program. The court's ruling today confirms what the American public already knew: The National Security Agency's data collection program went too far in collecting the phone records of Americans, said Sen. Cruz. Congress should immediately pass the USA FREEDOM Act, of which I am a proud cosponsor, to strike the right balance between privacy rights and national security interests. The USA FREEDOM Act ends the NSA's unfettered data collection program once and for all, while at the same time preserving the government's ability to obtain information to track down terrorists when it has sufficient justification and support for doing so. A Regional Update from North Texas Regional Director Jason Wright: As all Texans know, on Sunday night, two terrorists attempted to attack an event held in Garland, and I had the honor of visiting with Assistant Garland Chief of Police Jeff Bryan following the attempted attack. It was remarkable to hear first-hand of how a brave Texas officer with a pistol executed such a feat against radical Islamic sympathizers armed with assault rifles. We are fortunate to have such dedicated and well-trained law enforcement protecting Texans. Earlier this week, I had the opportunity to visit with George W. Jensen, Founder and CEO of Amplex in Grand Prairie, TX. He is a business pioneer, and his entrepreneurship has created countless jobs in our state. Recently, the Irving ISD Foundation hosted the Breakfast with the Stars to award many students  including first generation college attendees  scholarships for outstanding academics, athletics, music, and leadership. I had the privilege to attend, and it was inspiring to see the community come together to support promising young people.

,114,Male,N00013799,43309,"Forbes, Randy (Rep.) [R-VA4]"," Send me an email | Forward to a Friend Where is your money going at the UN? By Congressman Randy Forbes May 8, 2015 Heres a question for you to consider: Do you know what your taxpayer dollars are funding at the United Nations (UN)? You probably dont  and you would probably have difficulty finding out. The reality is, the federal government doesnt even have a full grasp on exactly how the UN is using its money. The United States (and more accurately U.S. taxpayers) is the largest contributor to the United Nations. In the ten year span between 2002 and 2012, funding for the United Nations nearly tripled, from roughly $15 billion to $41.5 billion. According to the Heritage Foundation, on average the U.S. provided approximately one-fifth of the contributions for that time period. The UN is a mammoth organization demanding mammoth funding levels. Within it, there are many distinct agencies, each with their own funding streams and their own objectives and activities. And, although the UN is subjected to audits in some cases, the organization is fraught with a history of scandal, corruption, and fraud. As such, the audits dont always tell the whole story. Just last year, an Associated Press story detailed news that top officials within the UN tampered with evidence so as to prevent investigations into corruption cases. Funding to the UN also largely operates in a no-strings-attached model. Dollars are appropriated to various agencies and funds with little accountability or understanding of how those dollars might be used. Because its difficult to trace the money, U.S. funding gets tied up in activities that are deeply opposed to our national interests. Taxpayer dollars, for instance, are believed to have been used in the United Nations Population Fund (UNPF), which has been linked to Chinas brutal one child policy. U.S. contributions have also been used to fund conferences, some of which have become platforms to promote anti-democratic , anti-American values. These are all matters we as a nation cannot afford to overlook. The original charter of the UN seeks to maintain global peace and security, create opportunities for cooperation among nations, and promote basic human rights. Our nation has always stood for those values. Unfortunately, the UN has moved further away from those values. The more of an investment you make in something, the greater the stakes become. The United States government has a responsibility to do its due diligence in making sure the UNs intent is being carried through and that our national interests are not at risk. We have a responsibility to demand transparency and accountability, tracking dollars  even pulling funding when necessary. In Congress, Im working to shed light on the activities of the UN. We must make it a priority to implement vital reforms in our relationship with the UN to ensure that the American people know where and how their taxpayer dollars are being spent. Our government has a responsibility to ensure that money is not being wasted or spent contrary to U.S. interests. We have an obligation to make certain that American sovereignty is never undermined. H.R. 1034, a bill that I have cosponsored, requires a simple but commonsense action: that the Office of Management and Budget provide a report to Congress each year, detailing all U.S. contributions to the UN and its affiliated agencies. The report requires a detailed description and purpose of each contribution, as well as the percentage of U.S. contribution to each agency compared to contributions from other sources, like other nations. This adds a layer of accountability that has been grossly missing from the UN funding process. Transparency and accountability in funding at the UN is an economic and spending issue, but it is also an issue of what is in the American peoples best interest. The U.S. should not be forced to support activities that are wholly opposed to our national interests and what we, as a nation, stand for. America operates best when it is governed of the people, by the people, for the people  not of the people, by the people, for the United Nations.

The partnership between our two nations is special and needs to be protected. Our days were packed with meetings with public officials, senior military leaders, young IDF soldiers, current and former ambassadors and even innovative tech entrepreneurs leading Israel's way as a startup nation. I look forward to taking what I have learned on this mission and getting back to work in Congress in a bipartisan fashion. Among the many great moments of our week, here are five highlights: 1. Israeli Defense Minister Bogie Ya'alon  Our group met with the Defense Minister of Israel, Bogie Ya'alon, to talk about the shared challenges ahead for Israel and the U.S. He underscored the connection between the reluctance of others to recognize Israel's fundamental right to exist as the Jewish State of Israel and the security threats faced by the nation. See more  . 2. Former Israeli Ambassador Michael Oren  We met with former Israeli Ambassador to the United States, and current Knesset Member, Michael Oren to discuss the U.S.-Israeli partnership and how our countries can work together toward a more secure world. See more  . 3. United States Marines  Walking through Jerusalem we ran into a group of Marines in Israel to train, including brave young men from Illinois! This moment underscored the close security collaboration between our two nations and how the U.S.-Israel relationship is undeniably a two-way street. See more  . 4. U.S. Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro  We met with U.S Ambassador to Israel Dan Shapiro and had a lengthy discussion about Iran's nuclear program, Iranian-backed terrorism against Israel and the treatment of Israel at the United Nations. See more  . 5. Start-Up Nation Central Director Wendy Singer  We met with Wendy Singer, the executive director of Start-Up Nation Central. Wendy talked about the key ingredients for Israel's start-up ecosystem and how Israel fosters innovation. Our country's partnership with Israel should extend beyond global security to ensure the economic prosperity of both countries. See more  .

This Republican Congress came together, united, to develop much needed improvements to ensure our nation's fiscal health and security and protect our individual freedoms all without raising taxes on hardworking families. Our budget will cut spending by more than $5 trillion. While this budget is by no means perfect, it illustrates that this Congress can function and govern on behalf of Texans and the American people. The Fiscal Year 2016 Budget will balance the federal budget over 10 years, strengthen the U.S. military and repeal Obamacare.

Roger Williams Recognized by U.S. Chamber As a small business owner and member of the House Financial Services Committee, I was honored to receive the Spirit of Enterprise Award from the U.S. Chamber of Commerce in recognition of my pro-business agenda.  I have experienced firsthand the effects of the good, the bad and the ugly that comes out of Washington, and I have seen its effects on Main Street businesses. Washington should be doing everything it can to promote pro-growth policies. Instead it is putting job creators in a chokehold and discouraging investment. There is little incentive today for entrepreneurs to take any risk, and I want to change that. The Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB), created within the 2,300 pages of the Dodd-Frank law, is a perfect example of how inefficient, top-down regulations are limiting choices and killing opportunities for economic growth and prosperity.  Last week I spoke to small dollar lenders, who, because of the CFPB, are facing unnecessary, one size fits all standards that are preventing them from providing needed capital. Washington should be promoting pro-growth policies, not hindering them. Remembering Jim Wright  I am saddened to learn of Jim's death. I knew Jim for a long time, and although we had a difference in political beliefs, he was a patriot who served his community with pride. I send my prayers and thoughts to his family who I know will miss him dearly.

,114,Male,N00030801,43556,"Guinta, Frank (Rep.) [R-NH1]","News from Congressman Frank Guinta  Home  About Frank  About Our District  News  Contact  ICYMI: Guinta from the Union Leader ""Spying reforms coming"" Ive heard from countless Granite Staters regarding their concerns with the government infringing on their privacy rights and civil liberties. Whether it be through the seven townhalls or four telephone townhalls I've held, I've heard your concerns and understand how important of an issue this is for the Granite State and for the rest of the nation. Below is a recent article I wanted to share with you about my thoughts on protecting and strengthening your privacy rights as certain provisions of the PATRIOT Act are set to expire on June 1, 2015. Guinta:  Spying reforms coming  Union Leader May 3, 2015 Since the original Patriot Act was signed into law in 2001 shortly after the 9/11 terrorist attacks, four reauthorizations of key provisions have passed with little argument. In the most recent vote, in 2011, a reauthorization bill passed the House and Senate with overwhelming majorities, including the ""yes"" votes of New Hampshire's entire delegation to Congress: Sens. Jeanne Shaheen and Kelly Ayotte and U.S. Rep. Frank Guinta and then-U.S. Rep. Charles Bass. But this time, with many provisions of the act set to expire June 1, the government's secret spying programs may be reined in by Congress, where some members see snooping and overreach as infringements on liberty. ""This is not going to be just a simple up-and-down vote anymore,"" Guinta said Friday. Those under-the-radar reauthorizations were before June 2013, when former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked thousands of classified documents to media outlets that shined new light on expansive NSA spying programs. The leaks included revelations that the NSA was collecting massive amounts of phone records on American citizens and was spying on several leaders of U.S. allies. ""That was never authorized by Congress,"" Guinta said. ""In my view, (the NSA) overstepped the legislative authority given to them by Congress."" The government must seek approval from the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act Court before targeting a foreign person or entity in the United States for surveillance. The FISA Court, for example, ordered Verizon to provide the NSA with daily feeds containing all telephone records, including local telephone calls, according to documents Snowden gave to the Guardian newspaper in London. >From 1979 through 2013, the government has submitted 35,333 applications to the FISA court for surveillance approval, according to the Electronic Privacy Information Center, a privacy watchdog organization. Just 12 were rejected, meaning the government's requests are granted 99.97 percent of the time, EPIC reported. ""That would suggest that the FISA Court is a rubber stamp,"" Guinta said.Snowden, who has taken asylum in Russia since the leaks, has been either lauded as a hero or vilified as a traitor for leaking the documents. His actions have ensured that when the key provisions of the Patriot Act, known as Section 215, that allow the government to collect massive amounts of data on American citizens expire June 1, its reauthorization this time around will be no rubber stamp. Guinta said that, at seven town halls he has hosted since January, ""the issue has come up at every single one."" Members of Congress from both sides of the aisle, including Guinta, have called for ending or substantially reforming Section 215. One such bill, dubbed the USA Freedom Act and sponsored by Wisconsin Rep. Jim Sensenbrenner, a Republican who authored the original Patriot Act, has passed a House committee and could be up for a full House vote later this month. The bill would curtail the bulk data collection efforts and enact other reforms of the Patriot Act. But at the same time, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, R-Ken., with the backing of Senate Intelligence Committee Chairman Sen. Richard Burr, R-N.C., has introduced a bill to reauthorize Section 215 without reforms through 2020.Guinta, though, said he sees McConnell's bill as ""a starting point"" that wouldn't survive in the House in current form. ""I do not support the McConnell bill as it is currently drafted,"" he said. The rest of the state's delegation to Congress did not grant direct interviews, but commented in the form of prepared statements. ""The American people deserve to know with confidence that their government is not spying on them, which is why I have joined Republicans and Democrats in sponsoring the USA Freedom Act,"" said U.S. Rep. Ann Kuster, D-N.H. She said Snowden ""sparked an important and necessary debate"" but that she has ""grave concerns"" with Snowden's methods for disseminating the information. Shaheen said ""it's important that we look at sensible reforms that allow us to strike the proper balance between national security and civil liberties."" She voted for the USA Freedom Act in the previous session of Congress. ""The upcoming reauthorization debate gives Congress an opportunity to carefully review oversight capabilities and evaluate transparency and privacy concerns,"" Ayotte said. Of Snowden, she said: ""Those who willfully leak classified information to our enemies should be prepared to face the full extent of the law."" As contentious as the issue is on Capitol Hill, it has also highlighted division among candidates vying for their party's nomination for President in New Hampshire's first-in-the-nation primary. Kentucky Sen. Rand Paul is at odds with most of his GOP rivals for the presidential nomination. He has called for leniency for Snowden and an ""immediate"" end to the NSA's mass surveillance program. He is possibly joined by Texas Sen. Ted Cruz, who crossed party lines to back a Democratic bill last November to reform the NSA. Meanwhile, other announced or presumed Republican candidates favor keeping the NSA's programs intact, including former Florida Gov. Jeb Bush and U.S. Sens. Lindsey Graham of South Carolina and Marco Rubio of Florida. There is also disagreement among declared Democratic Party candidates.Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton has said the NSA needs some reforms to find a balance between privacy and security. Running as a Democrat, Vermont Independent Sen. Bernie Sanders, who was in New Hampshire on Saturday, has said Snowden deserves leniency. ### Sincerely,  Frank Guinta Member of Congress    Washington D.C. 326 Cannon HOB Washington, D.C. 20515 Phone: (202) 225-5456 Fax: (202) 225-5822 Manchester Office 33 Lowell St. Manchester, NH 0310 Phone: (603) 641-9536 Fax: (603) 641-9561 Unsubscribe  | Privacy  Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email    ",2015-01-06,1,Rep.,Representative,true,NH,NH01FGIMA@mail.house.gov,05/11/2015,Republican,42946,,https://guinta.house.gov,Representative for New Hampshire's 1st congressional district,Frank,RepFrankGuinta,,Guinta,G000570,202-225-5456,1970-09-26,https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/frank_guinta/412447,,,representative,,Representative,2017-01-03,Rep.

,114,Male,N00026160,43416,"Price, Tom (Rep.) [R-GA6]","Congressman Tom Price Congress Completes Joint Balanced Budget Resolution* This past week, the Senate passed our joint balanced budget resolution, capping off an historic and much needed bicameral agreement on funding the federal government. For the first time in years, Congress has passed a budget that actually balances. It's an important step toward restoring real fiscal responsibility in Washington and building a stronger, safer and more secure America. It has been an honor working with Senate Budget Committee Chairman Mike Enzi (R-WY) and our colleagues these past few months. Together, we have built a balanced budget that will promote a healthier economy and make Washington more accountable. There is much we have done, and there is much yet to be done. In the weeks and months to come, we must build on this successful effort and continue to put forward positive solutions to the myriad of fiscal, economic and national security challenges facing our great nation. *Our Congressional Balanced Budget by the Numbers:*  $5+ trillion in savings.  $32 billion surplus in 2024, $24 billion surplus in 2025, and stays in balance in the out-years.  $400 billion in additional economic growth over the next 10 years, according to CBO.  1.2 million additional jobs over the next 10 years, based on CBO data.  2001  Restores the trust of hardworking taxpayers by passing the first joint ten-year balanced budget resolution since 2001. Why We Fight for Positive Solutions* As we've said before, our budget is not merely numbers on a page. It's a vision for our country. That is why we continue to fight for positive reforms to important programs like Medicare and Medicaid that will not only help restore fiscal responsibility but also improve the efficiency and effectiveness of those programs. In this past Monday's Wall Street Journal it was reported [link to article] that ""Medicaid recipients newly insured under the health law [Obamacare] are struggling to get appointments or find doctors who will accept their coverage."" There's no mistaking that Medicaid is in dire need of reform. That is why in our recently passed budget we put forward policies to improve this program by giving states more freedom and flexibility to tailor the program to meet the needs of their communities. Simply adding millions to a broken system -- as Obamacare has done -- is foolish and harmful. And our reforms efforts don't stop there. Congress must also tackle important priorities like our transportation and infrastructure challenges. *As reported in this weekend's Atlanta Journal-Constitution:* ""The idea that Congress should play a role in infrastructure is 'a fairly bipartisan view,' said Rep. Tom Price of Roswell, who chairs the House budget committee. How to pay for it is a different matter. ""'The resources are there if we prioritize correctly,' Price insisted. 'What that means is we've got to get the federal government out of what it ought not to be doing ... to do the things the federal government ought to be doing.''

This is the first time since 2001 that Congress has passed a budget that balances within 10 years. When the American people put Republicans in control of both houses of Congress last November, they rightly expected the new majority to show they are capable of governing. I believe that passing this budget is an important way to do just that. Families in the 12th District and across the country must live within their means, and I have long been a supporter of government doing the same. Its just common sense. I support this balanced budget because it puts America on a path of fiscal discipline. The budget begins to pay off our national debt, repeals the Affordable Care Act, and strengthens Social Security. The budget does not raise taxes, and instead calls for reforms to our government to make it more efficient, effective, and accountable to the people it serves. This budget also boosts funding for our national defense, which is a priority for me. I believe decisions related to our national security should not be made on the premise of arbitrary cuts and sequestration, but rather based on our national security interests. In addition, this budget puts a plan in place to responsibly provide critical resources for our men and women in uniform. The American people entrusted the Republicans to be fiscally responsible and govern effectively. This balanced budget is one major step toward fulfilling that promise.

,114,Male,N00032029,43583,"Griffith, Morgan (Rep.) [R-VA9]","National Day of Prayer Thursday, May 7 was the 64th annual National Day of Prayer. I attended a prayer service that day and, as I do often, thanked God for our blessings and prayed for the future of our great nation. May God bless these United States, and may He bless each and every one of you. Update  NSA Phone Collection Program Ruled Illegal According to the POLITICO inside-the-beltway news journal, also on Thursday, May 7, a three-judge panel from the New York-based 2nd Circuit U.S. Court of Appeals held that a law Congress passed allowing collection of information relevant to terrorism investigations does not authorize the so-called bulk collection of phone records on the scale of the NSA program. The judges did not address whether the program violated the Constitution. This is the first appeals court to have ruled on the legality of this National Security Agency (NSA) metadata program, which was repeatedly approved by the secret Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court (FISA Court). I would have liked for the court to address whether this program violates the Constitution. However, let us recall the experiences of Great Britains John Wilkes and Massachusetts James Otis, Jr. George III, then King of England, was infuriated by anti-government publications coming out of east London and issued a general warrant allowing government officials to search house-to-house and seize papers, property, persons, etc. to determine the author or publisher of this material. As a result, more than 50 people were arrested and much property was seized. This ultimately led to a constitutional crisis and made famous the publisher of those anti-government publications, a man named John Wilkes (Wilkes became so famous in America that the mother of Abraham Lincolns assassin named her son for John Wilkes roughly 40 years after Wilkes' death). The English courts would later use cases arising out of the Wilkesite rebellion to put restraints on general warrants and establish the principles of the freedom of the press. Similarly, in American history, the Excise Act of 1754 gave tax collectors a writ of assistance allowing them to search building-to-building (including homes, shops, warehouses, anywhere the searcher desired to look) and seize prohibited goods. In 1761, James Otis, Jr., an attorney, led the legal fight against general warrants and writs of assistance in court. I would agree with Otis, who said, I will to my dying day oppose, with all the powers and faculties God has given me, all such instruments of slavery on the one hand and villainy on the other as this Writ of Assistance is. After these stirring arguments and others, the court ruled against Otis. However, a young John Adams was in the courtroom as Otis spoke. He would later say the ruling in the case on writs of assistance was the spark in which originated the American revolution. It is clear our Founding Fathers were not in favor of general warrants. This, to me, is evident in our Fourth Amendment, which prohibits unreasonable search or seizure of persons, houses, papers, and effects. I would submit that our Founding Fathers would not be in favor of bulk metadata collection either. To borrow from an editorial I recall having read in the Roanoke Times, the phrase A rose by any other name would smell as sweet may be applied to skunks as well. A skunk by any other name still smells the same. Update  Immigration and the Rule of Law I joined a number of my colleagues in the House and the Senate in signing an amicus brief challenging the Presidents actions on immigration. This brief will be filed with the Fifth Circuit as it considers the federal governments appeal of the preliminary injunction currently blocking implementation of the Obama Administrations immigration actions. Though I believe the Presidents immigration actions are unconstitutional, this important debate is not about whether you like these policies. It is about whether you like the rule of law.

,114,Male,N00033839,43653,"Veasey, Marc (Rep.) [D-TX33]","Dear Friends, This May, I urge you to join me as I renew my yearly pledge to health and fitness. I introduced a resolution recognizing the month of May as Health and Fitness Month and I am dedicated to making healthy living attainable for all Americans, empowering them to increase their physical activity and to improve their nutrition to lead robust lives. Together, we can take small steps every day to guarantee a healthier future for all. According to the Center for Disease Control, there has been a steady increase in obesity in the United States during the past 20 years. I know how important it is to Americans everywhere that we take the steps needed to make sure our children and loved ones can live to their maximum potential. For this reason, I am introducing for the third year in a row a resolution to ensure that our nation makes health and fitness a priority every day. Designating the month of May as Health and Fitness Month is more than just a pledge for me. Due to my concerns about making healthcare a priority for Americans everywhere, I will host the following FREE and family friendly events in the DFW Metroplex and in Washington, D.C. in recognition of Health and Fitness Month and to answer your questions: Wednesday, May 13th Congressional Health and Fitness Expo 12PM-2PM Rayburn Foyer, Rayburn House Office Building 45 Independence Ave SW, Washington, DC 20515 As part of his legislative agenda to make health and fitness a priority nationwide, Rep.

We treated my wife Debbie to a special day in thanks for everything she does for our family. Make sure you take the time to thank the mothers in your life. It's a hard job they do, and they deserve the recognition! * The Iran Nuclear Deal * ICYMI: Nation can do more to help our veterans * Around the District The Iran Nuclear Deal Last week, the Senate approved a bill that would allow Congress to have input into any ""deal"" the President negotiates with Iran on their nuclear program. I've said all along that Congress must have input in this process. We've seen the failed attempts of this President's negotiations before, and I worry that we'll give up far too much in these talks. What's worse, Iran has proven time and time again that they don't have any incentive to work with our country. They pose a serious threat to our allies like Israel and the stability of the Middle East, and I think we should be very careful moving forward. The House may consider this legislation this week  I'll be sure to keep you posted. ICYMI: Nation can do more to help our veterans Did you see my op-ed in the Philadelphia Inquirer about my bill to give more flexibility to our veterans seeking mental health care? Read it here  . ""We have a clear mission. The men and women who fought and served our country deserve the highest-quality, comprehensive care for their bodies, minds, and spirits. It is our hope that the Veterans' Mental Health Care Access Act will help us deliver it."" Around the District  I loved chatting with Jacqueline, a patient at the Willingboro DaVita Dialysis Center. My tour of the center helped me learn more about dialysis and the kidney care needs of many of our friends and neighbors.  Wish I could spend every morning with these bright young people! With Keith Buscio of Santander Bank, I helped teach Mrs. Conforti's 3rd grade class at Clara B. Worth Elementary School about the values of saving money.  I was honored to be the keynote speaker at the New Jersey Association of Counties 65th Annual Celebration of County Government. It was great to visit the booth for the Ocean County Board of Chosen Freeholders, who I work with on many initiatives.  It was great speaking to such an inspiring group of educators at the Burlington County School Board Association meeting. I was also excited to help recognize members who were earning special honors at the event.  Had a very interesting tour of the Jack & Jill Midlantic Vending in Moorestown. We discussed industry specific issues like EPA regulations and saw a vending operation facility.  I had a very informative meeting with Colonel Lissner about the role of the Army Reserve in New Jersey. I was particularly impressed to hear about the efforts of the 99th Regional Support Command after Superstorm Sandy devastated our region. I remain grateful for the efforts and service of our military men and woman.

Dear Friend, We all had a teacher from our childhood who pushed and inspired us to become who we are today. Those who challenged us to work harder, dream bigger, and reach our full potential. Legendary college basketball coach John Wooden famously said that ""the teaching profession contributes more to the future of our society than any other single profession."" I couldn't agree more. Last week, we celebrated National Teacher Appreciation Week. Every year, this is a time to pay tribute to those across the country who have dedicated their lives to educating children and preparing them for successful and productive lives. America is home to about 4 million elementary and secondary teachers, those who deserve our admiration and appreciation not just during this special week, but in every week throughout the year. Last Friday, I introduced a resolution in the House of Representatives honoring teachers and all of those who have dedicated their lives to education. These men and women have earned the respect of their communities for their commitment to our children, and their tireless work should make all of us proud. Our education system is constantly evolving, and our teachers, principals and staff face new and different challenges every day. Working to prepare students for successful college and professional careers, the daily strains of managing a classroom and ensuring school safety are constant. Our children are our nation's future. This resolution is a simple way for the United States Congress to say 'thank you' for everything teachers do to make that future brighter.

[R-SC2]","  Home  About  Contact  Services  Media Center  Issues  Military/ Veterans  Resources  Honoring South Carolina's Small Businesses and Teachers       I am grateful to serve you in Congress, and I appreciate the opportunity to provide you with updates on the happenings in Washington and across South Carolina's Second Congressional District. As last week marked Small Business Week, it is an important time to show gratitude for the small businesses whose dedicated entrepreneurs support our communities by creating jobs and investing locally. I recently visited a number of small businesses in the Second District to tour their facilities and speak with employees. A few weeks ago, I toured the Gun Rack of Aiken and met with owners Chuck and Stephanie Scott to discuss their day-to-day operations and the important role of small businesses in our local economy. I also spoke with the Gun Racks employees and a business consultant with the Aiken Area Small Business Development Center in South Carolina (SBDC), who assisted the Gun Racks owners in getting their business loan.   [L-R] Congressman Joe Wilson meets with co-owner Chuck Scott, SBDC consultant Bob Clark, Gun Rack employee Tuck Poston, Gun Rack employee Ed Kronberger, owners' son Larson Scott, and co-owner Stephanie Scott, to discuss the Second Amendment and small business issues. Recently, I visited Nephron Pharmaceuticals Corporation in West Columbia and SpeedTree in Lexington to discuss their operations, local job creation, and small business priorities. SpeedTree is a software developer that recently won a Scientific and Technical Academy Award for their work. For more information and photos from these tours, please click here to view my Facebook page  . Small businesses are crucial to South Carolinas economy, serving as major contributors to our economic investment and employing almost half of our states workforce. It is critical to ensure federal policies help small businesses expand and create jobs, yet onerous regulations from Washington and our nations complex tax code continue to block opportunities for growth and hiring. In the House of Representatives, my colleagues and I recently passed legislation that promotes common sense solutions for small businesses in South Carolina and across America. I was grateful to vote in support of the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act and Americas Small Business Tax Relief Act to increase transparency of burdensome, job-destroying regulations, give small businesses a voice in the regulatory process, and provide critical tax relief by making certain tax provisions permanent. We also passed the Death Tax Repeal Act to repeal the estate tax, also known as the death tax, to protect American families and small business owners from crippling taxes and harsh penalties when leaving property to their families. I remain committed to supporting meaningful reforms that will help small businesses thrive, while also advancing legislation that puts hard-earned money back in the hands of taxpayers. For more information, please click here to view my recent op-ed detailing our efforts to help small businesses do what they do best  create jobs  . As you may know, May is South Carolinas Teacher Appreciation Month. In celebration of our teachers, I am asking all members of our communities in the Second District to recognize educators who have gone above and beyond in their teaching capacity and have worked to make a difference in the lives of their students. As the husband of a retired teacher, I know firsthand the time, resources, support, and guidance our dedicated educators give to their students.  Please click here to share your story of a teacher who has helped inspire you or someone you know so that I can help recognize them for their important contributions to students and our communities  . I regularly take the opportunity to visit schools and honor educators throughout the year, but look forward to the opportunity to give special recognition to our hardworking educators this month. In Congress, I'm working to return local control over education to the states because the federal government's overreach into our state's school system is unprecedented. I recently introduced the Local Control of Education Act  , which allows states to opt out of Common Core and prohibits the federal government from using grants or waivers to mandate, incentivize, or coerce states into adopting specific standards or academic curriculum. This bill would take control of education away from bureaucrats in Washington and give it back to those who know the needs of our students best  parents, teachers, and local school administrators with elected school boards.

,114,Female,N00033106,43627,"Wagner, Ann (Rep.) [R-MO2]","A message from Congresswoman Ann Wagner  About  Contact  Services  Media Center  Issues  Dear Lindsey, After a productive district work week in St. Louis, I am headed back to Washington. But first, I wanted to share with you some of the things that happened last week. Capt. Wagner Promotion Ceremony On May 1, I was honored to join my eldest son, Raymond III, at Ft. Campbell, Ky., as he was promoted to the rank of captain in the U.S. Army. His service to our country has always been an enormous source of pride to Ray and me, but I must say that I was at a loss for words during his promotion ceremony. It is an incredible honor to be the mother of a member of the United States armed forces.   Retail Investor Protection Act I would like to share with you an excerpt from an article released last week about my work on the Financial Services Committee and a piece of legislation that I have sponsored: The second-term Republican congresswoman from Missouri has become the de facto tip-of-the-spear against the Department of Labors recently proposed conflict of interest rule, which seeks to place a fiduciary standard of care on all advisors to retirement plans and individual retirement accounts. I find it despicable that Sen. Warren, D-Massachusetts, would take an entire industry and essentially call them all snake-oil salesman, said Rep. Ann Wagner in an interview between appropriations votes on the House Floor last week. This proposal is another instance of top-down, Washington-knows-best approach. But the Obama Administration has shown no investor harm. This rule is a solution in search of a problem, she said. You can view this article from Benefits Pro in its entirety, here  . Local Superintendents Meeting Last week I had the opportunity to sit down with superintendents from around the Second Congressional District to discuss the importance of anti-trafficking education in our schools. According to the Department of Justice, 300,000 American children are at risk of falling victim to human trafficking every year. Along with Cindy Malott from the YWCA, I shared information and had an important discussion with these leaders about what we can do together to protect our children. I appreciate those who took the time to meet with me and I look forward to our continued efforts to end modern day slavery.  MetLife Town Hall Last week I visited the MetLife campus in South County to meet with their leadership team and participate in a town hall meeting with employees. The St. Louis campus employs 500 associates serving their Property and Casualty, Group Variable Universal Life business and tax and actuarial corporate functions. It is always helpful to hear from my constituents and it was a pleasure to answer their questions and discuss what we are doing in Washington.  2016 Service Academy Applications I am now accepting applications to the United States Service Academies for the 2016 nominations (class of 2020). I am honored to hear from young people seeking a nomination to one of our outstanding Service Academies. As the mother of a United States Military Academy graduate, the privilege of nominating outstanding candidates to each of the academies is a responsibility I take very seriously. For more information on the academy nomination process and frequently asked questions, click here  . As always, it is an honor to represent you in Washington and I look forward to speaking with you again soon.

,114,Male,N00027510,43444,"Perlmutter, Ed (Rep.) [D-CO7]","May 10, 2015 Hi, Its been a busy spring in Washington D.C. and here at home and I wanted to share a few of the things Ive been working on. As always please dont hesitate to contact me with questions about legislation or if you need assistance with a federal agency. Hope to see you soon, Congressman Ed Perlmutter Legislative Update Energy and Water Appropriations Republican Budget Fails to Invest for the Future After weeks of closed-door negotiations, the Republicans emerged with a Budget Conference Report that included $5 trillion in cuts to fundamental programs important to Coloradans and Americans. Programs such as Medicare will no longer exist in its current form along with other programs to help hardworking families buy a house, pay for college, and save for retirement. The Republicans in the House and Senate have opted to ram through a budget which jeopardizes our kids and grandchildrens future and chips away at a bright future for our country. With the economy growing stronger every day, we need a budget that invests in our future and continues the positive momentum in Colorado and our nation. While I appreciate resources provided for important water projects under H.R. 2028, the Energy and Water Development Appropriations Act for Fiscal Year 2016, the legislation cuts $266 million from research for Energy Efficiency and Renewable Energy (EERE) programs and includes several controversial policy riders. These drastic cuts undermine important programs and jeopardize America's competitiveness and economic growth. I cosponsored an amendment to redirect over $25 million to support EERE research like that being done at the National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL) in Golden. The important research and development taking place at NREL will change the way we fuel our future and our economy. H.R. 2028 also failed to fully appropriate Facilities & Infrastructure funding which keeps the lights on at NREL and funds energy integration research being done at the Energy Systems Integration Facility. We need to work toward energy independence with clean and efficient technologies to secure America's energy future, power economic growth, create good-paying jobs, and reduce carbon pollution. I will continue to support research and development of more efficient energy use and renewable power sources today to build a cleaner and more sustainable tomorrow. Marijuana Businesses Access to Banking Act of 2015 Congressman Denny Heck and I reintroduced the Marijuana Businesses Access to Banking Act of 2015. Legitimate businesses are being shut out of the banking system and forced to operate on a cash-only basis because of outdated federal regulations. This is an issue of public safety. Not only are the proprietors at risk, but the employees and customers are also at risk of serious and violent crimes. It is estimated that 40 percent of the marijuana-related businesses in Colorado are unbanked. This means hundreds of millions of dollars in cash are moving around the streets of Colorado. This legislation has support from both Republicans and Democrats in the House and the Senate. I look forward to working with my colleagues to move this commonsense legislation forward. Congressional Art Show Celebrates the Work of Nearly 90 Students Nearly 90 pieces were entered from all over the district for this years Congressional Art Competition. Students demonstrated an outstanding level of creativity and artistic ability using photography, oil, drawing and other mediums. Congratulations to this years winner, Mingxin Ye of Golden High School. Her winning oil painting, Storyteller, will hang in the United States Capitol for the next year. Thank you to all the students and teachers for making this years competition such a success and a big thank you to Michelle Haney and Red Rocks Community College for hosting this years art show.

All three projects are well on their way to completion and will provide Commerce City with greater access and increased recreational opportunities. I'm looking forward to seeing these projects once they're finished and the positive impact they will have on the Commerce City community. Click here read more about Commerce Citys Capital Improvement Program. Constituent Success Story: Getting Fenwicks Pension and Health Insurance Back Every year, the Office of Personnel Management (OPM) sends out thousands of letters to verify current addresses and combat fraud for retirement benefits. Once in the while there is a miscommunication as in the case of Fenwick, a resident of Lakewood. The OPM offices correspondence failed to reach Fenwick and ultimately the agency stopped his pension and health benefits. Fenwick called my office to see if we could help. Representative Perlmutter provided me with direct intervention with OPM, which had suspended my retirement income and health benefits. Thank you, Ed Perlmutter! My office is here to help the hardworking people of the 7th Congressional District. We want to help you cut through red tape when dealing with a government agency or with any other issues you are facing. Im proud my office was able to help Fenwick, and I look forward to helping you in the future. If you are having an issue with a federal agency, please call my office at 303-274-7944.

,114,Male,N00027649,43542,"Huelskamp, Tim (Rep.) [R-KS1]","Congressman Tim Huelskamp ----------------------------------- Dear Friends, I had the joy of being home this week and meeting with constituents across Kansas' Big First district. I visited small businesses, spoke with students at a school where my first intern taught, joined Kansans in the National Day of Prayer, and enjoyed participating in a huge parade. I also held four Town Hall meetings--making 287 while I've been in Congress. * NSA  Bulk Collection of Your Data Without a Search Warrant* Before I tell you about what I learned in the District this past week, I wanted to share some news on government intrusion into your life. On Thursday, a federal appeals court in New York ruled unanimously that Section 215 of the PATRIOT Act does not authorize bulk collection of Americans phone call records. This court decision comes just weeks before the expiration of the PATRIOT Act and as Congress considers potential legislation to extend these mass data collection programs. Ever since I became fully aware of how the National Security Agency (NSA) has been trampling on our constitutionally-protected right to privacy in the Fourth Amendment, I have been an outspoken critic of these programs. Simply put, I do not believe the federal government has the authority to require phone companies to turn over your private phone records, and I applaud this court decision. It seems these super-secret surveillance programs were more focused on filling the role of Big Brother than keeping our country secure  and now more than ever it is time for the rest of Congress to join me in protecting our constitutional rights. * Local Office Hours* Also, this upcoming Wednesday and Thursday, my District staff will be hosting local office hours in Mankato and Beloit.

Hersey, Beloit  * Small Business Week* Last week wasNational Small Business Week. In my Town Halls, I hear from Kansans worried about the massive growth of government. I've heard time and time again from Main Street businesses that don't want handouts  they just want the government out of their lives so they can make a profit, grow their business, and provide for the community. On Tuesday, I had the opportunity to visit family-owned R-TECH Tool and Machine Inc. in Wamego. Its a small business with a little over 40 employees. The owners, Doug and Rachelle Routh, started the business more than 20 years ago. They work with Caterpillar and other companies to produce the kind of machinery that is used across Kansas and the nation in agriculture, construction, transportation and more. I also dropped in to see Caterpillar's Work Tools facility. [image = I discussed R-TECH's operation with owner, Doug Routh. [image = I crossed this off my ""bucket"" list while touring Caterpillar in Wamego. * Wamego High School Visit* Last week, I got to visit my friend and former intern, Will Clark, who is a teacher at Wamego High School, and his government and history class. I told them a bit about what its like to be a member of Congress and covered some of the challenges were facing as a country. I shared about our national debt and asked them how many zeros were in a trillion. ""Too many"" one said. Yes, too many. Teacher Will Clark asked if any of the students were happy with their school lunches. They laughed. ""They don't have butter for our rolls!"" I also heard from a student whose father is an Afghanistan Veteran. The student had heard that the VA is notorious for bad care. I talked about the Veterans' Choice Program and how it is meant to allow Veterans to choose where to get their care when the VA is too far away or not able to care for them promptly. [image = I spoke with Will Clark's Wamego High School politics and history class. * *National Day of Prayer** Thursday was National Day of Prayer. My staff and I went to several events across the district to pray for our state and our country. If youve been tuned into the news of the last few weeks, you know that the world we live in needs prayer. The earthquake in Nepal, the terrorists attack in Texas, riots in Baltimore, and the ongoing deterioration of our families  our nation needs prayer as much as it ever has. Please take a moment to pray for our nation. Pray for our nation to turn toward righteousness. Pray for strong families, traditional Marriage and the Right to Life. More than 20 million children live in a home without the physical presence of a father. It's an epidemic in our country. Children need their parents' support and God in their lives. May God Bless and Protect our United States of America! [image = [image = Canton [image = Manhattan [image = Pretty Prairie * * * *The 102nd Annual All Schools Day Parade** Friday, I joined in the 102nd All Schools Day Parade in McPherson, part of a week-long celebration where Kansans come together to celebrate education andhonor graduates from eighth grade, high school and college. McPherson County residents started the tradition in 1914! [image = I met many young folks along the All Schools Day parade route.  * *Town Halls** Town Halls are crucial to me representing the Big First in DC. The 287 I've held so far have allowed me to keep my finger on the pulse of what those in the First District find important. They have brought new light to issues, and I have used that knowledge back in Washington. The stories constituents share make a difference. I heard how our brave Veterans have to jump through hoops and travel long distances  as far as Texas and Colorado sometimes  to get health care they have earned. I pressured Veterans Affairs leadership to change their nonsensical 40-mile Veterans Choice rule, referencing the concerns I learned about in Town Halls. As a result, the VA changed their rules so more Veterans have access to care closer to come. [image = In Pottawatomie County, attendees brought their concerns on the need to defend marriage and life and the governments effects on their livelihoods. [image = In Liberal, we discussed the role of the Supreme Court and the Constitution, internet privacy, and VA care and the agency's irresponsible spending. [image = At my Town Hall in Meade, attendees brought up the topics ofImmigration, border security and the President's illegal amnesty. [image = Lastly, in Ashland I answered questions about regulation surrounding the Lesser Prairie Chicken, the Waters of the U.S. rule, and ObamaCare.

,114,Female,N00027860,43617,"Duckworth, Tammy (Rep.) [D-IL8]"," A Message From Congresswoman Tammy Duckworth     About Me  | Services  | Contact Me  Connect with Me     Rep. Tammy Duckworth travels to Washington with her daughter. Dear Neighbors, Last November, I experienced one of the greatest joys of my life: the birth of my daughter, Abigail. Like many working moms, I knew that balancing my career with my daughter would be a challenge, and it's something I planned for before her birth. But I never imagined that airports would present one of my biggest obstacles as a new mother. As a member of Congress, I travel a lot for work. Weekly flights from my district in the northwest suburbs of Chicago to Washington have become routine and fairly uneventful. While my disability can make traveling difficult, I found that traveling with my daughter is a different challenge entirely. Finding a clean and private space to breastfeed or pump breast milk in an airport can be burdensome and stressful, if not impossible. It's not uncommon for moms to be directed to a bathroom. We would never ask our fellow travelers to eat their meals in bathrooms stalls, yet we ask new mothers to feed their children while sitting on a toilet seat. Moms shouldn't have to worry about finding a place to breastfeed while they're traveling; they already have enough to worry about. Unlike other public spaces, travelers have little control over the amount of time spent in airports. No matter what they're doing or where they are, breastfeeding mothers need to express milk every few hours. Missing even one needed pumping session can have several undesirable consequences, including discomfort, leaking, inflammation and infection, decreased milk supply, and ultimately, breastfeeding cessation. The value of breastfeeding cannot be overstated: the health benefits can last a lifetime for both mother and child. Children who are breastfed are more resistant to disease and infection early in life, including Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. And in the longer term, breastfed babies have reduced risk of obesity, type 1 and 2 diabetes, asthma, and childhood leukemia. Women who breastfeed have a lower risk of getting breast and ovarian cancer, type 2 diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Whether or not a mother decides to breastfeed her newborn child, the opportunity to breastfeed in a safe and comfortable environment should be available to all new mothers. We made progress in recent years by requiring employers to provide new mothers a private place other than a bathroom for nursing. This is a crucial step, but what about the breast-pumping mother who travels? A recent survey of 100 airports found that only 8 percent met the minimum requirements for a lactation room. Even more troubling, 62 percent of the airports still self-reported that they were breastfeeding-friendly even though they did not meet the minimum standards. Some that do have lactation rooms have placed them outside of security zones, forcing moms to use public restrooms when in the terminal. It is clear that though airports have made sincere efforts, there is still a misunderstanding of what is necessary to accommodate traveling mothers. Fortunately, there's a movement in many states to make much-needed changes. Last year, California passed a law requiring airports to provide lactation rooms with electric outlets, chairs and a sink to wash breast pumps. In Illinois, similarly promising legislation is making its way through the Legislature. I'm now looking to make a change at the national level by introducing the FAM (Friendly Airports for Mothers) Act, which would require airports to provide accessible, safe, clean and convenient lactation rooms for travelers. While I'm sure flowers will be much appreciated by new moms this Mother's Day, I'm confident most would also appreciate a commitment to clean and comfortable places to breastfeed their children at airports across the country.

,114,Male,N00030184,43545,"Richmond, Cedric (Rep.) [D-LA2]","Congressman Cedric Richmond, 2nd District of Louisiana Dear Friend, This Mothers Day, I want to take the opportunity to thank all mothers for the sacrifices they make every day. My mother has always been one of the strongest influences in my life. She has given me the inspiration to follow my dreams and she instilled in me the tremendous value of honesty, hard work, and a good education. To this day, I look to her for guidance and as an example of how to live my life both as a person and a public servant. A mothers job is often difficult, laborious and thankless, but every mother can have the same positive impact on their childs life that my mother has had on me. Here in Congress, we should recognize this and work to support mothers across the nation as they work to support their families. Delivering on equal pay for equal work would allow a working mother to provide for her family with fewer constraints. Access to quality childcare provides the flexibility to work or pursue educational goals. Providing paid leave so that mothers are not forced to send their sick child to school. Making college affordable would make it so that those mothers who wish can achieve success in the classroom without hindrance. These are just a few of the steps Congress can take right now to give working mothers the support they both need and deserve. I value the major contributions mothers and all women make to our country and will continue to fight for policies that put them, their dreams, families, and goals first. Whether its sending flowers or just saying thank you, take time to ensure every mother knows how important they are today and every day.

,114,Male,N00021207,43438,"Nolan, Richard (Rep.) [D-MN8]","Monday Report from Representative Rick Nolan top banner      Tourism's Winning Partnership Creates Jobs, Memories and Fun Across Northern Minnesota  Fishing with friends - is there anything better? My wife Mary and I had a great time fishing with our guide Denny Van de Linde. Our tourism industry draws in visitors from all over the world to experience our lakes, rivers trails, restaurants, hotels and other activities. Dear Friend, With the fishing opener and the summer vacation season getting into full swing, we talked ""tourism"" at our roundtable in Duluth last week with hospitality leaders who reminded us that right along with taconite and timber, tourism is the critical third leg of the economic stool here in northern Minnesota. In the 8th District alone, tourism is a $1.8 BILLION annual industry that supports some 28,000 jobs - and 3.5 million visitors to Duluth annually. It's a PARTNERSHIP where government underpins transportation infrastructure - the highways, airports, railroads and harbors that bring people here - private investments support resorts, restaurants, sports, cultural and recreational opportunities - and our friendly, welcoming people make everyone want to return. In fact, every one of our panelists emphasized the importance of transportation to tourism's success. Anna Tanski, President of 'Visit Duluth' said more than 60 percent of the city's visitors come from the Twin Cities and arrive via I-35 - contributing $8.9 million to the community every year in lodging, food and beverage taxes alone. Tom Werner, Executive Director of the Duluth Airport Authority, added that, ""Our modern airport and I-35 make it easy for people to come and enjoy Duluth and points north."" Ken Buehler, Executive Director of the Lake Superior Railroad Museum, emphasized the importance of building the Northern Lights Express (NLX) high-speed railroad between Duluth and the Twin Cities. ""High-speed rail works all over the world,"" he pointed out, ""and it can work here too."" Everyone involved in Duluth-northern Minnesota tourism is excited about the upcoming season. Janelle Jones from the Two Harbors Chamber of Commerce is looking forward to another record summer of hiking and biking at Split Rock Lighthouse State Park, where 320,000 visitors also spent millions of dollars at local hotels, restaurants and shops last year. Ron Johnson from the Duluth Port Authority, Brian Daugherty from Grandma's Restaurants, Gerry Goldfarb from Holiday Inn & Suites and Dan Russell representing the Duluth Entertainment and Convention Center all echoed the optimism and excitement. Clearly, northern Minnesota has the right tourism formula - a partnership in which entrepreneurs, government leaders and wonderful, welcoming people create good jobs, good fun and lasting memories for everyone lucky enough to join us ""up north"" all year around. Hats off to them all. We will keep you posted as events proceed. Meanwhile, I want to hear your thoughts. Feel free to contact any of our offices listed below or send me an  email  . Sincerely,  _____ A Vet's Honor Delayed - But Not Denied  We had the privilege of presenting Joel Heller from Duluth - and his son Noah - with three medals and a ribbon that he had earned during his service but never received. Thank you for your service and sacrifice, Joel. When deserving Veterans don't receive medals they have earned in service to our nation due to mistake or an oversight at the Pentagon, our office is honored to step in - and that's exactly what we did for former U.S. Army Private First Class Joel Heller, who had been waiting for more than 10 years to be recognized for his service and sacrifice in Iraq, Kosovo, Bosnia and immediately following the events of September 11, 2001. What an honor it was to invite Joel and his family - including his parents, his brother, his wife and his young son Noah and so many other friends - to our office last week for the official presentation of four medals in addition to his Purple Heart: The Army Service Ribbon, the Armed Forces Reserve Medal, the National Defense Service Medal and the Armed Forces Expeditionary Medal. In his eloquent acceptance, Joel said he's most proud of the Expeditionary Medal because it's reserved for an operation for which no other U.S. campaign medal is approved - and where foreign armed opposition or imminent threat of hostile action was encountered. Noah, a second grader in Duluth, helped pin the medals on his dad's chest - and there wasn't a dry eye in the room. Presidents Washington and Lincoln were both fond of pointing out that how we treat today's Veterans will determine how willing future generations will be to step up when they are called upon to defend our nation. If you believe you have earned a military medal or recognition but haven't received it, please feel free to call our office at 218-464-5095. We're happy to help. _____ Men as Peacemakers - 17 Years of Hope & Change for the Better  We were honored to present the 2015 Community Peacemaker Awards to Nalani Harris (The Steve Rolland Youth Peacemaker Award) - Kim Sisto Robinson (The Gary Gordon Adult Peacemaker Award) and to the Greysolon Plaza Resident Council (the Organizational Peacemaker Award). For the past 17 years, the Men as Peacemakers (MAP) organization of Duluth has spread the important message that everybody as a role and a responsibility in preventing violence against women, standing by the survivors and sending the right messages to our kids - so it was a real honor to help present MAP's Community Peacemakers Awards last week at their annual dinner. As I pointed out in my remarks, Men as Peacemakers is part of a remarkable, life changing energy growing every day in northeast Minnesota. Recently, Mary and I were in Duluth taking part in the 40th anniversary of PAVSA - celebrating the groundbreaking work they do to stop sexual violence and support survivors. Last fall, we brought Vice President Joe Biden to town to pay tribute to the Duluth Model in the battle against domestic violence. While there were plenty of women in the audience at our Men as Peacemakers event, MAP was founded to recognize the need for MEN to also stand up and do their share for a better and more peaceful world. So I ended my little speech with this quote from Robert Kennedy, who told students in Cape Town, South Africa in 1966 - the worst of apartheid times: ""Each time a man stands up for an ideal, or acts to improve the lot of others, or strikes out against injustice, he sends forth a tiny ripple of hope, and those ripples build a current which can sweep down the mightiest walls of oppression and resistance."" _____ Lutherans Tell How Violence and Extortion in Honduras Create Misery, Drive Immigration  Meeting with representatives of the NE Minnesota Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church to discuss the challenges posed by rampant violence and extortion taking place in Honduras and other South American nations. Last week in Duluth, representatives of the Northeast Minnesota Synod of the Evangelical Lutheran Church briefed us with disturbing information about extortion, extreme violence and human rights abuses taking place in Honduras following the 2009 military coup that sent that nation's elected president, Manuel Zelaya, into exile. They emphasized both the need for immigration reform in the U.S. - and for assurances that U.S. aid will not go to support totalitarian governments that condone violence against their own people in order to stay in power. These Minnesota Lutherans, who have an official Companion Synod relationship with the Lutheran Church in Honduras, explained how terrible conditions in their home countries drive people to risk their lives and everything they own to immigrate to the United States and other safer nations - and how local churches in Honduras struggle to help people who live in some of the most dangerous neighborhoods in the world. When the sun goes down and violence escalates, they described how families turn off their downstairs lights and move upstairs where they are less likely to be hit with stay bullets or kidnapped by roving gangs. And they told stories of restaurants and stores being forced out of business by extortionists who demand more ""protection"" money than these tiny operations bring in. I'm convinced there are enough Democratic and Republican votes to pass comprehensive bipartisan immigration reform if Speaker Boehner would simply allow us to consider and vote on a bill. Meanwhile, we will continue to press the State Department for assurances that U.S. aid is directed to help people in need - not governments that promote violence, kidnappings and corruption. _____ ""How About Some Coffee?"" Serving It Up at the 54th Annual Duluth Lion's Pancake Day  As I told one of the local radio stations last Thursday morning, for efficiency's sake, we should turn the federal government over to the Duluth Lions Club. Every year - and this is their 54th - the Duluth Lions have served some 10,000 people pancakes, sausage and all the trimmings at their annual fundraiser. And there are no lines - and no waiting! This year, Yours Truly poured many gallons of coffee to go along with all the good conversation and fun. Hats off to the Duluth Lions and to all the volunteers, businesses and pancake eaters who contribute to their good work through this wonderful fundraising event! _____ Campground Groundbreaking at Lake Vermilion-Soudan Underground Mine State Park  We broke ground for the new camp ground at Lake Vermilion-Soudan Underground Mine State Park last week. Lake Vermilion is Minnesota's newest state park and an important addition to the $1.8 billion dollars and 28,000 jobs tourism already provides here in the Eighth Congressional District. What a pleasure to join Governor Mark Dayton, former Governor Tim Pawlenty, Minnesota Senate Majority Leader Tom Bakk, Minnesota House Speaker Kurt Daudt and so many other friends to break ground for the new camp ground project at Lake Vermilion-Soudan Underground Mine State Park last week. The camp ground is the latest local addition to an outdoor recreation and tourist sector that contributes more than $1 trillion a year to our nation's economy - and supports 9.4 million jobs. Here in Minnesota, our state parks draw tourists from across the nation and around the world - folks who boost local jobs and local economies by eating in restaurants, staying in hotels, buying gifts and enjoying all we have to offer throughout the region. With that in mind, we're working hard to reauthorize the Land and Water Conservation Fund so important to establishing and maintaining recreational resources like our new Lake Vermilion camp ground. Paid for with fees imposed on companies that drill offshore for oil and gas, this fund has been helping protect and enhance natural resources and conservation since Congress authorized it in 1965. Since then, Minnesota's Eighth Congressional District has received more than $130 million for a wide variety of worthy outdoor projects. Reauthorizing this fund should be a no-brainer - in fact, the pollsters tell us that more than 85% of the American people see it as vital to supporting tourism and jobs, and protecting our public lands for generations to come. I hope we can get this reauthorization done without delay. _____ The Return of a Lake Mille Lacs Icon  That's one big scissors cutting the ribbon for the grand re-opening of Eddy's Resort, which has been providing good jobs and great fun on Lake Mille Lacs since 1960. Just in time for fishing opener, what a pleasure it was to be on hand for the grand re-opening of the legendary and now better than ever Eddy's Resort on Lake Mille Lacs. Eddy's has been providing good jobs and great fun for tourists and locals since 1960 - and after the Mille Lacs Band of Ojibwe purchased it, we got to work with the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers to secure a sanitary water and sewer line extension from Garrison to the resort in order to make the renovation possible. It's important to note that these water and sewer lines don't just benefit Eddy's Resort - but also solve a number of environmental issues stemming from homes and businesses south of the Mille Lacs Reservation. And in the process we're protecting spawning grounds for the Walleye that enter Lake Mille Lacs on the east and the Rum River on the west. So this is a win-win-win for the entire region: More jobs, more recreation and cleaner water. _____ Coming Up in Washington This week: . Congress returns this week to consider a number of issues. We're expected to debate legislation dealing with the Clean Water Rule, the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), and National Security Administration reforms. . With respect to the Clean Water Rule - I believe that blocking the agencies from releasing their final product simply makes no sense. It provides no certainty to the regulated community on where the rules apply, and it leaves many of our nation's waters unprotected. Let the agencies finish their work, and if Congress wants to revisit this issue afterward, it has ample authority to do so. _____ Finally... Happy 2015 Fishing Opener!  Mary and I had a great morning last Saturday on Lake Vermilion for the Fishing Opener. Saturday was the fishing opener - and like the deer hunting opener, it is an official Nolan family holiday and unofficial Minnesota state holiday. Mary and I kicked off the season with Governor Dayton on Lake Vermilion. Click here  for more information from the Minnesota DNR. _____ Nolan in the news...

Read an excerpt of Marcos speech below and watch the entire speech here. Rubio: So at the end of the day,  if left to the choice we have now, I dont think theres any doubt that were in a better position if this bill passes, because at a minimum at least it creates a process whereby the American people through their elected representatives can debate an issue of extraordinary importance. Rubio Calls For Reauthorization Of FISA Authorities Earlier this week, Marco joined Senators Richard Burr (R-NC), Tom Cotton (R-AR), and Jeff Sessions (R-AL) on the Senate floor to discuss the need to extend current authorities under the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).

And the first question out of everyones mouth is going to be, why didnt we know about it? And the answer better not be because this Congress failed to authorize a program that might have helped us know about it.  This is a serious threat, and I hope we reauthorize this bill.

In his exchanges with Obama Administration officials, Marco expressed his concerns regarding the security of our Interests Section in Cuba and the possibility of the Interests Section in Havana being infiltrated by Cuban intelligence agents, and asked about the impact of these concerns on the transition of the Interests Section into an embassy. Marco also inquired whether the U.S. had received a request from the Colombian government to release narco-terrorist Simn Trinidad, who is currently in U. S. custody, as part of its peace negotiations with the FARC, to which the administration replied that at the present time there were no discussions about his release. A video of Marcos opening statement and the full exchanges is available here, and a transcript of his full opening remarks is available here. ICYMI: My Vision For Europe On the 70th anniversary of the allied victory in Europe, Marco wrote an op-ed outlining his vision for Europe. Read an excerpt of the op-ed below and the full version here. Rubio: As we face our own challenges today, let us never forget the sacrifices made by our ancestors 70 years ago. Let us always remember that the freedoms we cherish now were preserved by those who came before us, and that just like the greatest generation, we have a duty to preserve liberty for all those in the transatlantic community and beyond. Marco also commented on the national election in the United Kingdom. Reach an excerpt below and his full statement here. Rubio: The British people have spoken, and my wife Jeanette and I congratulate Prime Minister David Cameron on the Conservatives victory. I look forward to continuing to work with Prime Minister Camerons government in the years ahead as we tackle problems around the globe, especially in the Middle East and with Russias continued aggression in Ukraine. Constituent Casework Corner Constituent Jennifer recently got married and needed her name changed in the Medicare system (CMS). She had already submitted the change to the Social Security Administration (SSA), but the records were not being reflected by Medicare. Senator Rubios staff contacted CMS and SSA, and the correction was made immediately.

I still want to hear from you. I would like to share with you the early results, and let you know there is still time to make your voice heard. A majority of you supported strengthening our economy and creating good jobs. I also heard many voices in support of reforming the tax code by cutting inefficient and unfair tax breaks, lowering the costs for healthcare, and defending the U.S. against threats of terrorism. There were many of you who took the time to offer specific feedback. Let me share with you some comments that resonated: I'm not alone in my belief that the best thing Congress can do is start working for the good of the people instead of wasting time on political infighting. HONESTY-DO THE RIGHT THING! Not the Democrat or Republican thing - but the right thing for ALL concerned. Fixing our broken political system. I agree. Congress must get past the inaction, past our own petty factions, and past all the demagoguery and distractions. We have to create jobs, expand opportunity, and strengthen the middle class.

,114,Male,N00007727,43273,"Blumenauer, Earl (Rep.) [D-OR3]","Dear Friends, Last week, as the U.S. House of Representatives considered a bill to fund the Department of Veteran Affairs (VA), I offered an amendment to make it easier for qualified veterans to access medical marijuana. As things stand, the VA specifically prohibits its medical providers from completing forms brought by their patients seeking recommendations or opinions regarding a veterans participation in a state medical marijuana program. My amendment would have ensured that no funds made available to the VA could be used to implement this prohibition, which would have, in effect, struck it down. It was an agonizingly close vote with broad bipartisan support, but ultimately fell three votes short at 210-213. I have long advocated on this issue and offered a similar amendment last year. Why? Because while there is no single approach to aiding our nations veterans, medical marijuana is proven to help in treating a wide range of conditions  from nausea to chronic back pain. It also appears very helpful in treating post-traumatic stress and traumatic brain injuries that our veterans frequently suffer. It is unacceptable for our wounded warriors to be forced out of the VA system to simply seek a recommendation on whether or not medical marijuana is a good treatment option. We should not be preventing access to medicine that can help them deal with these injuries to survive and thrive. This narrow loss on the first vote on marijuana legislation this year is a clear signal there is movement and bipartisan support in reforming outdated federal marijuana policies  including legislation to allow state-legal marijuana businesses to deduct business expenses and to no longer have to operate on a cash-only basis. While I am disappointed, I am not discouraged. We received more votes on the amendment than last year, with 13 more Republicans voting yes and 10 fewer Democrats voting no. I will continue to fight for our veterans, including ensuring they are treated equitably in having access to medical marijuana.

[R-AZ5]"," A Message From Congressman Matt Salmon Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email  Banner Image 550px by 110px Dear Friend, I've posted a new update on the latest from Washington on my website. Please take a minute to read the full post at the link below. Matt _____ How we can Start Saving you Money Link  Last week was a busy one. To start things off right, I announced the introduction of my Shrink our Spending initiative into the 114th Congress. This is an annual program that I began last year to identify and cut wasteful spending in our budget. In last years SOS, while I looked at only a few programs, I managed to find over two trillion of your hard-earned tax dollars ready to be saved. This year I aimed even higher. Watch the video below to learn more.  You can also get more information on the initiative at my website,  , and while youre there be sure to subscribe for email updates to make sure you see my latest bills to save you money. Weve got to start cutting spending somewhere, and any of these bills would be a great first step. On Thursday the House began voting on some big measures. First, the House passed the Conference Report to Accompany S.Con.Res. 11  , a bill that established the budget for the United States Government for Fiscal Year 2016 and set forth appropriate budgetary levels for 2017 to 2025. We passed the bill by a vote of 226-197  . This budget achieves balance within 10 years, without raising taxes, reducing total spending by more than $5 trillion. Moreover, the Conference Report calls on the committees of jurisdiction to repeal the Affordable Care Act through reconciliation; ensures that total defense resources are above the President's request in the five and ten year budget window; and grows the economy by more than $400 billion over the next ten years, according to CBO estimates. The House also passed H.R. 2029  , the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016, by a vote of 255-163  . H.R. 2029 provides $171 billion in budget authority for the FY 2016 programs and activities funded in the bill. The bill provides $163.2 billion in discretionary and mandatory spending for the benefits and medical care of our nation's veterans (an increase of $4.1 billion), and $7.7 billion in discretionary spending for military construction and family housing (an increase of $904 million). H.R. 2029 provides $76.6 billion in discretionary fundinga $4.6 billion increase and $2.2 billion below the Presidents budget request. The House also took action to defend religious freedom when it passed H.J.Res. 43  , a resolution disapproving the action of the District of Columbia Council in approving the Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act of 2014, by a vote of 228-192  . H.J. Res. 43 disapproves and prevents implementation of the Reproductive Health and Nondiscrimination Act (RHNDA) within the District of Columbia, which was passed by the D.C. council in December, 2014 ostensibly to prevent employers from taking punitive action against any employees for using abortion services or birth control. In reality, the RHNDA would restrict the ability of organizations within the District of Columbia to make employment decisions in line with their deeply held beliefs. These restrictions would apply to both religious and political organizations. Finally, on Friday, the House passed H.R. 2028  , the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016, by a vote of 240-177  . H.R. 2028 provides funding for the Department of Energy, the Army Corps of Engineers, and vital national defense nuclear weapons activities. The legislation provides a total of $35.4 billion in discretionary funding for FY 2016, which is $1.2 billion above the FY 2015 level. The bill prioritizes funding for national security, providing increases for nuclear weapons programs above fiscal year 2015, and protects funding for critical national and regional waterways. section divider graphic Join Me On...

,114,Male,N00024842,43445,"Courtney, Joe (Rep.) [D-CT2]","   About Joe  | How Can I Help?  | Issues  | Press  | Schedule A Meeting  May 5, 2015 Dear Cormack, I wanted to update you on newly-passed legislation that will help to protect seniors' identities, and a proposal that would ensure the future of the program for decades to come. Social Security remains the bedrock of retirement for millions of Americans, supplementing savings to keep seniors out of poverty and help them live out their golden years in dignity, after a lifetime of work. Protecting Seniors' Personal Information from Scammers First, Congress recently passed a bill that will remove Social Security numbers from Medicare cards  . In addition to stabilizing the payment rates for doctors who treat Medicare patients, the bipartisan legislation sets a deadline to change both newly-issued and existing cards over a period of four years. I hear from eastern Connecticut seniors often about their rightful concerns that the widespread use of Social Security numbers on Medicare cards and other documents leaves them vulnerable to identity theft. As scammers become more prevalent and sophisticated, this change to Medicare cards will help keep crucial identity information safe.  Congressman Courtney recently spoke with seniors at the Pawcatuck Neighborhood Center about Medicare, Social Security, and protecting against scams. Keeping Social Security Strong for the Future Second, I recently joined Connecticut Congressman John Larson as a co-sponsor of his bill, the Social Security 2100 Act. This important legislative proposal would update Social Security benefit calculations to increase monthly payments, strengthen the Social Security Trust Fund, and cut taxes for beneficiaries by raising the taxation threshold. While the Social Security program is currently projected to remain solvent for more than two decades, this bill would extend the solvency of the trust fund beyond 2100. As saving for a secure retirement becomes more challenging, with the decline in defined-benefit pensions and increase in reliance on personal savings, strengthening Social Security is more important than ever. The social insurance program we all pay into has kept millions of seniors out of poverty, assisted survivors and Americans with disabilities, and enabled a higher quality of life and economic security for hardworking families. Now is the time to act to keep the promise of Social Security for current beneficiaries and future generations.

[D-CA41]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email  News from Representative Mark Takano  facebook  twitter  you tube  flickr  Dear Friend, Welcome to my e-newsletter, an update for the residents of California's 41st Congressional District. With this newsletter, I hope to keep you informed about recent happenings in Washington and events that I've held throughout the Inland Empire. As always, I encourage you to email me  so I can stay informed about your views and interests. You can also connect with me on Facebook  and Twitter  . I look forward to hearing from you! Sincerely,  Mark Takano Member of Congress _____ Rep. Mark Takano Introduces Higher Education Regulation Legislation to Protect Students Last month, Rep. Mark Takano (D-CA), Rep. Susan Davis (D-CA), and Rep. Steve Cohen (D-TN) introduced the Protections and Regulations for Our Students Act, also known as the PRO Students Act. Currently, 30 State Attorneys General, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, the Securities Exchange Commission, the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, and the Department of Justice are investigating for-profit colleges for fraudulent practices. Earlier this week, Corinthian Colleges Inc. closed its remaining campuses, leaving more than 16,000 students in limbo and thousands of employees without a job. It is estimated that the closure of Corinthian Colleges Inc. could cost American taxpayers $214 million. The PRO Students act is a comprehensive piece of legislation designed to protect our nation's students from these bad practices and bad actors. By ensuring that students have access to important and accurate information and data, strengthening oversight and regulation, and holding schools accountable for violations and poor performance, we can help ensure that our student and taxpayer dollars are being well spent, and that students are receiving quality, affordable education.  _____ Rep. Mark Takano Opposes Estate Tax Repeal Last month, Rep. Mark Takano opposed the repeal of the estate tax, which would cost taxpayers $270 billion. After voting against the legislation, Rep. Takano took to Facebook to outline the misplaced priorities of House Republicans.  _____ Rep. Mark Takano Attends Oral Arguments for Marriage Equality Cases Rep. Mark Takano (D-CA), one of the seven openly gay Members of Congress, released the following statement after attending oral arguments for the Supreme Court case Obergefell v. Hodges, which questions whether the Fourteenth Amendment requires states to grant and/or recognize same-sex marriages: ""During oral arguments for Obergefell v. Hodges, the legal team for the plaintiffs made it clear, as it has always been, that the Constitution is intended to grant rights - not strip them away from one particular group. States that are refusing to grant same-sex couples the right to marry and the spousal benefits that come with marriage are in clear violation of the Fourteenth Amendment, which says that no state shall deny any person equal protection under the law. Plain and simple. ""Far too many same-sex couples have lost out on the benefits granted through legal marriage. But if we continue to discriminate and refuse the right to marry to all same-sex couples, no matter what state they reside in, we are doing something much worse. We are telling millions that their love is invalid. That is not what our nation is about. ""By ruling in favor of marriage equality, the Justices would confirm what millions already know - that a person's gender or sexual orientation does not matter when it comes to marriage. All that matters is what is in one's heart. However, I encourage them to go one step further and do as Supreme Court Justices of years past have done in landmark cases, and return with a unanimous decision. Doing so would not only keep the court on the right side of history, but it would help it maintain its legitimacy in the eyes of the American people."" _____ Rep. Mark Takano Chosen As An Escort for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's Remarks to Congress  Last month, Rep. Takano released the following statement after being chosen as an escort for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's remarks to Congress: I was honored to be selected to serve as one of Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe's escorts into the chamber today during his address to a joint session of Congress. I thank Prime Minister Abe for addressing us and reaffirming the bond between our nations, which has only grown stronger over time. I was especially moved when Prime Minister Abe offered his condolences to the Americans lost during World War II and when Lt. General Lawrence Snowden, who served in Iwo Jima, shook the hand of Shindo Yoshitaka, who is the grandson of a Japanese garrison commander who also served in Iwo Jima. Throughout his remarks, Prime Minister Abe reiterated the many benefits of the relationship between Japan and the United States, which include a robust economic partnership and regional security. I stand with Prime Minister Abe in his call for us to strengthen our alliance, but we can only do so in a manner that benefits working and middle-class citizens in both nations. The Prime Minister also spoke of an ambitious plan to raise the opportunities of women in Japan and close the gender wage gap. I commend him on his support of Japanese women and hope to see other injustices corrected. Doing so would send a message to the entire world and confirm that Japan is fully committed to women's rights. It is especially an honor to have Prime Minister Abe speak before us being that this year will mark the 70th anniversary of the end of World War II. Our nations have formed an important bond since then, and I look forward to continuing to work together for the benefit of not just every Japanese and American citizen, but people all across the globe.

,114,Male,N00027229,43425,"Fitzpatrick, Michael (Rep.) [R-PA8]","Congressman Mike Fitzpatrick ----------------------------- Proudly Representing the 8th District of Pennsylvania ================================================================ *The New Front Line in the Fight Against Terrorism** It cost al-Qaeda a mere $500,000 to plan and execute the terror attacks of September 11, 2001. Today, ISIS brings in four-times that amount *in a single day.* >From the Middle East to Latin America, the spread of ISIS threatens freedom and security around the globe. Fueled by its unique ability to self-fund and finance its warped ideology through non-traditional means, the terror group now has a reported net worth of over $2 billion. This flow of money was the focus of the first Task Force to Investigate Terrorism Financing hearing [link 1] held last week in the Capitol. As chair of the new task force [link 2],it is critical Congress understand the financial threat, its impact and what we can do in response. Throughout the hearing and testimony from expert witnesses the stark reality became clear that the capability of terror organizations to raise money and move it globally is something that cannot be reduced to sound bites or brief headlines. International terrorism is a complex, multi-layered threat in many parts of the world, but, we too, are in the line of fire at home and abroad. [image = [link 3] Todays terror threats are financed by the sale of millions of dollars worth of oil a day through the control of land including oil fields. Additionally, revenue comes from a wide variety of new, diverse methods: criminal activities, extortion networks, kidnapping, human trafficking, the sale of stolen antiquities and even the taxation of the fish or charcoal trade. This astounding stream of revenue is fueling terrorism and regional destabilization, and has the ability to power its exponential growth worldwide. And not just through ISIS; groups like Boko Haram, Hezbollah and nacro-terrorists are adopting methods of self-financing at higher levels. Adding to these threats are concerns over the worlds largest state-sponsor of terror: Iran. Testifying before the task force, Jonathan Schanzer, research vice president of the Foundation for Defense of Democracies, highlighted that some of the $11.9 billion cash transfers the United States made to Iran between November 2013 and June 30, 2015 could be finding its way to terrorist organizations threatening Irans neighboring states and those planning strikes in the United States. His testimony, along with that of the other witnesses, included an assessment of the role of other Middle East nations and their particular contributions  willingly or unknowingly - to the spread of terrorist organizations and money flow through a value-transfer system.  [image = [link 4] Schanzer pointedly said the road ahead will be challenging, while offering the task force a few steps we could take, including encouraging administrative action, targeted financial sanctions to fight the criminal networks and congressional oversight of the Iran deal. *Money has become a frontline in the fight against terrorism. *To shut off the spigot, any U.S. strategy will require multilateral cooperation with foreign governments and local law enforcement in those nations  especially in the financial sector. The mission is clear: Disrupt the ability of terrorists to finance their operations, strengthen the safeguards within our financial system and give our agencies the tools authority to address this threat.Unfortunately, as David Cohen, a former Undersecretary for Terrorism and Financial Intelligence at the Treasury Department and current CIA Deputy Director has noted: theres no silver bullet to empty ISIS, or any other groups, coffers.  Over the next five months I plan to lead the task force in addressing these challenges  an opportunity as serious and wide-reaching as any Ive had during my time in Congress. Working with experts and bipartisan lawmakers, this task force will have at hand the information needed to shape a modern, impactful response to the complexities of terror financing that must serve as the cornerstone for Congress and the administrations anti-terror strategy. What lies ahead is a daunting, but high-level objective. As legislators, we are entrusted with the protection of Americans and will do what it takes to counter this threat on various levels, beginning with the task force investigation and the eventual take down of the networks financing the deadly operations. ----- If you have any questions or comments regarding this or any other topic, please dont hesitate to contact my Washington, DC office at 202-225-4276 or District office at 215-579-8102.

[R-FL17]","News from Representative Thomas Rooney          Click here to forward this email  This week marks National Small Business Week, and I want to salute Floridas small businesses and entrepreneurs for their contributions to our economy and communities. According to the U.S. Labor Department, small businesses create two out of every three net new jobs. Thats why it is so important to provide in an environment where our small businesses can grow, thrive, and hire new workers. In the House, we are taking action to support our small businesses by passing bipartisan bills  that help them compete and succeed. In the first 100 days alone  , we passed:  The Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act (H.R. 527) to scale back the regulatory red tape that burdens Main Street so that small businesses are free to grow.  The Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act (H.R. 37), which cuts excess regulation so that small businesses have access to the capital they need to grow and create good-paying jobs.  The Small Business Tax Relief Act (H.R. 636) that helps to reduce uncertainty from government so that small businesses can invest in their future and grow.  The Save American Workers Act  (H.R. 30), which restores the 40-hour work week that Obamacares employer mandate destroyed so that small businesses can hire more workers at the hours that work for them.  The Hire More Heroes Act  (H.R. 22) to exempt veterans from Obamacares employer mandate threshold if they already have health care through TRICARE or the VA so that no employers are penalized for hiring a veteran and that no veteran is left jobless because of the mandate.  The Death Tax Repeal Act (H.R. 1105) to reform our tax system so that small businesses can be kept in the family, even when a loved one dies. As we celebrate National Small Business Week, please join me in recognizing  the small businesses that are the lifeblood of our economy in Floridas 17th District. If you have a favorite small business or small business owner, please comment and tag them in this Facebook post  to thank them for all they bring to our community.

[R-KY4]"," For Immediate Release Lorenz.Isidro@mail.house.gov Wednesday May 6, 2015 (202) 225-3465 U.S. Representatives Poe, Lofgren & Massie Introduce Bill To End Warrantless Surveillance Of Americans WASHINGTON, D.C. - Yesterday, Congressman Ted Poe (R-TX), Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren (D-CA), and Congressman Thomas Massie (R-KY) introduced H.R. 2233, the End Warrantless Surveillance of Americans Act. The bill would prohibit warrantless searches of government databases for information that pertains to U.S. citizens. It would also forbid government agencies from mandating or requesting back doors into commercial products that can be used for surveillance. The legislation mirrors an amendment the three members offered to the USA Freedom Act, which was backed by a broad bipartisan coalition including Members of Congress and outside groups across the political spectrum. The USA Freedom Act that passed out of the Judiciary Committee last week is an improvement over current law and a step in the right direction. But we can do more to protect the Fourth Amendment. In addition to stopping bulk data collection, Congress should also act now to stop warrantless searches under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), said Congressman Poe. Right now, under Section 702 the government is allowed to snoop and spy on the content of a citizens phone calls, texts and emails---all without a warrant. Failure to address this gaping loophole in FISA leaves the constitutional rights of millions of Americans vulnerable and unprotected. This bill also ensures that the federal government does not force companies to enable its spying activities. The NSA has and will continue to violate the constitutional protections guaranteed to every American unless Congress intervenes. Until we fix this and make the law clear, citizens can never be sure that their private conversations are safe from the eyes of the government. If Congress truly wants to end bulk collections of U.S. persons data, then we must also look at the warrantless surveillance occurring under Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act and Executive Order 12333, said Congresswoman Lofgren. Failing to do so all but ensures the nations spy agencies will continue to violate Americans privacy and the Fourth Amendment. I am pleased that Chairman Goodlatte has acknowledged that further reform is needed and committed the House Judiciary Committee to investigating this issue more closely in hearing, and I look forward to a productive conversation on how to finally end bulk collection and warrantless surveillance at that time. Surveillance under Section 702 of the FISA Amendments Act is arguably worse than the collection of records allowed under Section 215 of the Patriot Act, said Congressman Massie. Our Founding Fathers fought and died to stop this kind of warrantless search and seizure. The End Warrantless Surveillance on Americans Act is an important step toward reasserting the constitutional rights of all Americans. I look forward to continue working on this issue with Congressman Poe and Congresswoman Lofgren. ### NOTE: Please DO NOT respond to this email as this inbox is unattended.

,114,Male,N00036155,43704,"MacArthur, Tom (Rep.) [R-NJ3]","News from Congressman  Home  Contact  Services  Media  MacArthur Weekly Newsletter Dear Lindsey, Last week was one of the busiest weeks we've had so far in Congress. We were here into the early hours of the morning working on this year's defense bill, making sure our military has the resources it needs to be able to respond to changing threats around the world. It was incredibly productive, and I'm pleased to say I proposed and fought for six major items that all passed  . I wanted to briefly highlight some of them here, but you can read about them all by visiting my Facebook page here  . * Protecting the Joint Base from Closure * Saving the KC-10 * Tackling Veteran Unemployment * Around the District Protecting the Joint Base from Closure I've been working since January opposing President Obama's call for a new round of base closures in 2016. Here in New Jersey, some of you might remember how disastrous the closing of Fort Monmouth was right next door. We can't let that happen to the Joint Base  South Jersey relies on the base as the region's largest employer. That's why I stood up in Congress and fought to stop these base closures  and I was ultimately successful. Watch my floor speech on why base closures are a bad idea below.  Saving the KC-10 The KC-10 is a massive tanker with a single mission  refuel other planes mid-air so they don't have to stop to fill up. It can hold 350,000 pounds of fuel, making it by far the most capable and effective refueler in our Air Force. Here at the Joint Base, we have 32 of these planes. But unfortunately, the Air Force has said they'll be forced to put these planes into an early retirement if sequestration cuts hit. This would be a devastating move, so I fought in the early hours of the morning to save the KC-10. Along with Congressman Donald Norcross, I argued that these planes are critical to our military's capability and readiness, and at the end of the night, our colleagues agreed. We ensured that the KC-10 won't be retired early next year. Keeping the KC-10s in the air was important to our national security, and a crucial victory for the survival of our Joint Base. Watch my remarks below (starting at 1:25:52):  Tackling Veteran Unemployment New Jersey has the highest rate of veteran unemployment in the country, and as over 65,000 veterans call the Third District home, this is an issue near to my heart. When we were writing this years defense bill, I worked with Chairman Mac Thornberry to include an initiative Ive been working on. Its something I talk about in our district every week. It is a provision that would require the Joint Executive Committee, a partnership between the Department of Defense and Department of Veterans' Affairs, to work together on veterans' unemployment issues. They already work together on providing health care for these men and women  why should they stop there? We were successfully able to include my initiative in the final bill and is on its way to becoming law. Read my letter about this idea here  . Around the District  Spoke with the Community Medical Center in Toms River last week. This discussion touched on many issues like tort reform, the Affordable Care Act, and research and development.  Sat down with Sue Marticek and Bridget Holmes of the Ocean County Long Term Recovery Group  to discuss their ongoing work helping our area rebuild and recover from Superstorm Sandy. I'm proud of the work this group is doing, and looking forward to our continued partnership advocating for Sandy victims.  Members of our team in Marlton, Bob and Kyle, had a great meeting with Naya, Sherry, Charde, and Chi, who are students at the Rutgers University School of Social Work. They came in to brief our staff about a veterans assistance program.  Noriko and Jeff from my district office stopped by Senator Dawn Marie Addiego  's office this week to present her with a proclamation congratulating her for being named Legislator of the Year by the NJ Conference of Mayors. There was a lot of good news for South Jersey last week, and I'm excited to be spending this week at home meeting with many of you and talking about what's on your mind.

,114,Male,N00027649,43542,"Huelskamp, Tim (Rep.) [R-KS1]","Congressman Tim Huelskamp ----------------------------------- Hello friends, I wanted to share some of my efforts in Washington, D.C. this year fighting to protect Fort Riley and to strengthen the care and services available to our nations brave Veterans. * Meeting the Mental Health Needs of Our Veterans* Last summer, I heard the touching, heart-breaking testimony of the parents of Clay Hunt, a young man who was a combat veteran who died by suicide in 2011. After two tours of duty in Iraq and Afghanistan, he sought disability assistance and health care through the VA for his post-traumatic stress and other service-connected health issues. At one point, the VA even lost his file, and he faced endless delays and a never-ending appeals process. It wasnt until eighteen months after filing for disability assistance and five weeks after his death that his claim with the VA went through. This is not how we should treat our Veterans! In February, after a bill I co-sponsored passed both the House and the Senate unanimously, I joined my colleagues at the White House to see the Clay Hunt Suicide Prevention for American Veterans Act signed into law.*This bill is the first step towards improving mental health services for our Veterans, expanding access throughout the nation, and demanding more accountability for the VA.* This new law will help address the shocking 22 Veteran suicides per day.War often inflicts unseen battle scars on our brave men and women. They carry these scars home with them, and, without professional help, these injuries can tear apart individuals, marriages and families. I believe we can and must improve the VA as a whole, while expanding mental health choices for Veterans in our rural communities. [image = Congressman Huelskamp poses for a picture with James and Ellen Price after hearing how they have driven Veterans a total of 200,000 miles -- taking them to their doctors appointments. * Improving the VA by Replacing Bonuses with Accountability* In March, Congress passed two critical pieces of legislation with my support. The first bill, H.R. 280, will give the VA thelegal authority to recover illicit bonuses given to VA bureaucrats who made exaggerated or downright false claims. It seems that behind nearly every single scandal within the VA, there has been a poorly performing bureaucrat receiving extravagant bonuses. By replacing bonuses with accountability, we can send a clear message to those men and women caught lying and covering up these shocking scandals inside some VA facilities. The second bill I supported is the*Long-Term Care Veterans Choice Act*. This will allow additional options for long-term care for eligible Veterans in their own local communities, and it will also*cap employee bonuses*. Our Veterans deserve the best, and the VA should be more concerned about care than their bonuses. It is my hope the Senate will act quickly to move on these two valuable pieces of legislation. * Simplifying and Expanding Veterans' Choice Program* I am also proud to share that the*VA has**heeded my advice* [link 1]*,increasing the eligibility for Veterans to choose their care*when the VA cannot provide a timely appointment or when a Veteran has to drive more than 40 miles to the nearest VA facility. Before this common sense change, the VA barred Veterans from choosing their doctor or picking their hospital unless they were more than 40 miles  as a crow files  from the nearest VA facility.This improvement will allow more Veterans to participate in the new Choice program. [link 2] * *Highlighting the Mission and Capabilities of Fort Riley** Earlier this year, it was my pleasure to attend and speak at the*Army Community Listening Session at Fort Riley*. Together with thousands of local leaders and other citizens, we shared our perspective with Army leadership from Washington, D.C. In particular, I emphasized our state-of-the-art facilities at Fort Riley, the deployment capabilities of our troops, and the unique mission and training at our base. This Session was just one small part of a nationwide review of the Army and our national defense needs, challenges and assets. I treasure Fort Riley not just because the soldiers and their families are such an important part of our community, but because we all honor the sacrifices they make to protect and defend our nation.There is no doubt in my mind that Fort Riley provides the unique, mission-critical capabilities to meet our countrys need for a modern and adaptable 21stcentury military force. [image = Congressman Huelskamp speaking to thousands of Kansans who supportedFort Riley at February's Army Community Listening Session Additionally on April 2nd, it was a privilege to visit Fort Riley to observe the inactivation ceremony of the 4th Infantry Brigade Combat Team (4th IBCT) of the 1st Infantry Division to recognize their work and mission. Brigadier General Eric J. Wesley and Colonel Peter G.

This week we are celebrating National Small Business Week, an event that recognizes the important contributions of entrepreneurs from across the country. As part of that theme, I am happy to announce that I have been selected to join the House Committee on Small Business and will be the Ranking Member for the Subcommittee on Contracting and the Workforce. I would like to thank my colleagues in the House for appointing me to fill this position and vow that I will fight to increase opportunities for all hard working Americans. As a former small businessman, I know the challenges that face hard working Americans on an everyday basis. I will use my position on this committee to expand opportunities for the working class. I know that when small business succeeds, our economy succeeds. I look forward to using this position to ensure that the small business community in Hawaii thrives. Last week, after a marathon 18-hour session, ending at 4:35 a.m., the House Armed Services Committee finished the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) for 2016. I fought to include many important provisions for Hawaii such as the Red Hill Underground Fuel Facility Infrastructure Plan and almost $500 million in construction spending. I also pushed to include amendments that would help to secure our national defense, provide for military families and their children, and reverse harmful policy decisions that are negatively impacting our Department of Defense workforce. This month, we are celebrating Asian American and Pacific Islander (AAPI) Heritage Month. If you havent had an opportunity to do so yet, please watch my video message on AAPI Heritage Month HERE  .

,114,Male,N00025495,43568,"Barletta, Lou (Rep.) [R-PA11]","News from Representative Lou Barletta  May 6, 2015 U.S. Intelligence Capabilities ""Not Up to the Challenge"" in the Face of African Terrorist Threat  Listening to testimony at the subcommittee hearing On April 29, I attended a hearing of the House Homeland Security Committee's Subcommittee on Counterterrorism and Intelligence to examine the threat of violent Islamic extremism emanating from Africa. In recent months, Africa-based terrorist groups have undertaken numerous acts of violence against innocent people. We must ensure we are taking all necessary precautions to prevent similar attacks on the U.S. homeland. During this hearing, I questioned the Director of the Atlantic Council's Africa Center, Dr. J. Peter Pham, on whether the U.S. has adequate intelligence to properly vet refugees applying from areas within Africa where al-Qaeda and the Islamic State are present and active. Dr. Pham responded with ""unfortunately no,"" revealing that by and large our African embassies lack the resources necessary to properly vet applicants for admission to the United States. When I followed up by questioning Dr. Pham on how the U.S. can protect itself from inadvertently admitting a sympathizer or member from al-Shabab or Boko Haram, he admitted that ""our analytical and intelligence capabilities in Africa are quite simply not up to the challenge that we face."" We know from the 9/11 Commission that terrorists want two things: to find a way to enter this country, and to stay here. While recognizing the humanitarian crisis in areas ravaged by the Islamic State and overrun by al-Qaeda, we must also not forget that there are those who wish to do us harm, and therefore, we must remain vigilant as to who we admit into the United States. Unfortunately this is not the first time we are hearing such claims regarding our ability to screen foreign nationals. Just this February, FBI Assistant Director Michael Steinbach testified before the full Homeland Security Committee and expressed concern as to whether our government has sufficient intelligence in Syria to properly vet potential refugees from that state. To now hear someone with expertise in this area tell us that the U.S. similarly lacks adequate intelligence to vet refugees from areas in Africa controlled by Islamic terrorist groups is extremely alarming and reinforces my belief that one of the primary reasons we have immigration laws in this country is to protect our national security. I will use my position on the Homeland Security Committee to continue to fight for policies that protect the American people and Pennsylvania's 11th congressional district. From Washington... PROTECTING FAMILY BUSINESSES FOR FUTURE GENERATIONS On April 16, I voted for, and the House passed H.R. 1105, the Death Tax Repeal Act of 2015, by a vote of 240-179. This bill, which I was proud to cosponsor, permanently repeals the estate tax and makes permanent the maximum 35 percent gift tax rate and the lifetime gift tax exemption. As someone who began my career in my own family's business, I know how much work goes into making such an enterprise successful. After years of hard labor and careful planning, most people want to be able to pass on their life's work to the next generation. Unfortunately, in many cases, the Death Tax makes that impossible. The excessive rate applied often means that the assets must be broken up or sold off, just to satisfy the tax collector. That shouldn't be. We should no longer pretend that it is okay for the federal government to swoop in and take a huge chunk of someone's family legacy, especially since that person has been paying taxes on income at every step of the way. Death should not be a taxable event. PREPARING FOR THE ARRIVAL OF HIS HOLINESS POPE FRANCIS I am proud to report that I sponsored a resolution, H.Con.Res. 43, that authorizes the use of the Capitol Grounds for official Congressional events surrounding the visit of His Holiness Pope Francis to the United States Capitol on Thursday, September 24, 2015. The resolution was adopted by the U.S. House of Representatives by unanimous consent. Pope Francis, born Jorge Mario Bergoglio in Buenos Aires, Argentina, is the leader of the Catholic Church. He was ordained as a Catholic priest in 1969, became the Archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1998, and was made a cardinal in 2001 by Pope John Paul II. Following the resignation of Pope Benedict XVI on February 28, 2013, he was elected as his successor on March 13, 2013. Pope Francis is unlike any of our previous leaders in the Catholic Church. He is known for his humility, concern for the poor, and most of all his commitment to an open dialogue to build bridges between people of different backgrounds and beliefs. As a Catholic myself, it seems to me that Congress should take a page from his book. There's no denying there's a social divide in America right now, and while the continued economic decline is not helping that, finding real solutions to these problems is the answer. We should be building bridges, not burning them down. I'm committed to ensuring our children and grandchildren grow up in an America that's safe, prosperous, and something we can all be proud of. IN CASE YOU MISSED IT: Honoring Fallen Law Enforcement Officers On April 22, I spoke on the House floor in support of my resolution, H.Con.Res. 25, which authorizes the use of Capitol Grounds for the annual National Peace Officers' Memorial Service and the National Honor Guard and Pipe Band Exhibition. These events are held each year as part of Police Week to honor our nation's fallen law enforcement officers. This year, during the week of May 15, over 125 federal, state, and local law enforcement officers will be recognized for their ultimate sacrifice - giving their lives in the line of duty. I am pleased to report that my resolution was adopted by the U.S. House of Representatives by unanimous vote. Four of the officers being honored are from Pennsylvania, including one from Northeastern Pennsylvania: Corporal Bryon Dickson. Corporal Dickson was killed in September 2014 after he and Trooper Alex Douglass were shot by Erik Frein during an ambush targeting police officers outside the Blooming Grove barracks. After a seven-week manhunt, Frein was finally captured. The sacrifices of these officers, and the sacrifices of those like them, should not be forgotten. These tragic episodes should serve to remind all citizens of the dangerous jobs our men and women of law enforcement courageously volunteer for. They put their lives on the line to protect us daily, and for that we should always remain grateful. To view my speech, click here  . Op-Ed: We Can't Afford to Back Down from Infrastructure Investments The Highway Trust Fund is estimated to go bankrupt this summer, unless Congress acts now. Unfortunately, this is not the first time this fund has almost run dry. Since 2008, we have made six transfers - in total more than $60 billion - to the Highway Trust Fund from the General Fund, which is paid for by tax dollars and borrowing money from foreign countries such as China. This is not sustainable or fiscally responsible. We need a better, more affordable solution. To read the rest of my Op-Ed in Roll Call, click here  . Protecting the American Worker I was glad to be back at the Federation for American Immigration Reform's (FAIR) 9th Annual Hold Their Feet to the Fire Radio Row event fighting for the American worker and against illegal immigration. To see photos from my many interviews, visit my Facebook  page. U.S. Chamber of Commerce Spirit of Enterprise Award I was honored to receive the U.S. Chamber of Commerce's annual Spirit of Enterprise Award in recognition of my support for pro-growth, pro-jobs policies during the second session of the 113th Congress. This marks the fourth time I have received this prestigious award. To read more about this honor, click here  . ...To Pennsylvania MEETING WITH THE PA FARM BUREAU On April 10, I had the opportunity to meet with members of the Pennsylvania Farm Bureau (PFB) from Columbia, Luzerne, Montour, and Northumberland Counties to discuss issues important to the farming community. Cliff Miller from the Columbia County Farm Bureau presented me with the Friend of Farm Bureau award for supporting policies that eliminate excessive regulations on agriculture and help American farmers remain competitive. Agriculture is a major industry and job provider in Pennsylvania. It ensures our nation's food security and our national security. The ability to grow our own food means our communities do not have to rely on imported foods from foreign countries. That's important. We cannot let excessive regulations - such as the expansion of federal water to include mud puddles and ditches - drive Pennsylvania farms out of business. The Friend of Farm Bureau award is given each session of Congress to senators and representatives who are nominated by their respective state Farm Bureau and approved by the American Farm Bureau Federation (AFBF) Board of Directors. In order for a state Farm Bureau to nominate a member, that member must vote consistently in favor of Farm Bureau issues. The voting records are based on AFBF priority issues, as determined by the AFBF Board of Directors.  HIGHLIGHTING OUR STATES TRANSPORTATION NEEDS During the second week of April, I participated in the ""Pennsylvania Roadshow,"" an effort to draw attention to the infrastructure needs of Pennsylvania and America. I joined Rep. Bill Shuster, PA-9, Chairman of the Transportation and Infrastructure Committee, and other federal and state officials on a statewide tour to highlight the importance of Congress passing a long-term surface transportation bill. The Pennsylvania Statewide Freight Model projects a 50 percent increase in freight on I-81 between 2014 and 2040. While being a major freight hub has brought warehousing and distribution jobs to Cumberland County, it has also resulted in overwhelming traffic congestion that can shut this major freight artery and community down when an accident or other incident happens. Pennsylvania has more than 5,000 structurally deficient bridges. I recently toured the Greenfield Bridge in Pittsburgh, where a second bridge had to be built below the Greenfield Bridge to catch the debris falling from the original bridge. At the federal level, we must make a strong commitment to transportation infrastructure. We cannot allow our bridges to fall apart the way the Greenfield Bridge has. Right now, we can ship our goods faster than anyone else anywhere in the world. We need a strong infrastructure system to maintain Pennsylvania's and our national transportation cost advantages. I have long supported a long-term federal Highway Bill of five years or more. As it stands now, federal highway authorization is set to expire at the end of May 2015 unless Congress acts to sustain it. Without a long-term Highway Bill, cities and states cannot plan for their infrastructure projects, which means construction companies are not going to grow. I grew up in a family road construction business and built my own line painting company. They won't buy new equipment and they won't hire new workers. That affects employment, and state and local economies. MAIN STREET TOUR On April 9, I spent the day in Nicholson meeting with local residents to hear their concerns and thoughts on how Washington can work for them. After visiting the DL&W Station and learning more about efforts to revitalize this historic site, I also stopped by several other local spots including the Nicholson Diner.  Legislative Update PASSING THE FISCAL YEAR 2016 BALANCED BUDGET AGREEMENT: On April 30, I voted for, and the House passed, S.Con.Res.11, the Conference Report to the Fiscal Year 2016 Budget Resolution by a vote of 226 to 197. As Members of the House and the Senate we have an obligation to our constituents to be responsible stewards of their hard earned dollars. For the first time since 2001, Congress has the opportunity to approve a bicameral budget agreement that balances the budget within 10 years. We are finally putting the right foot forward in addressing Washington's out of control spending problem. This balanced budget agreement does not raise taxes, strengthens our nation's defense, protects our most vulnerable citizens, improves economic growth and opportunity for hardworking families, and, importantly, provides for the means to repeal the president's unaffordable and unworkable health care law. Importantly, this agreement requires the House Ways and Means, Energy and Commerce, and Education and the Workforce Committees to repeal the president's health care law and come up with patient-centered reforms to the health care system. It also repeals the bureaucratic Independent Payment Advisory Board and all Obamacare related taxes, penalties, regulations, and mandates. As a member of the House Education and the Workforce Committee, I am looking forward to being a part of the legislative process to enact health care policy that's right for everyone. Like past budget agreements, I do not agree with everything included in this funding blueprint for the upcoming fiscal year, and will work to improve any future legislation that may be considered as a direct result of its adoption.

My own service today is inspired by Speaker Wrights fervent commitment to serving the people of Texas and beyond. Speaker Wright was a man of deep courage, profound wisdom, and brilliant expression.

senior,"113,114,115",Female,N00027694,412243,"McCaskill, Claire (Sen.) [D-MO]","#letter_header {margin-top:0px !important} Dear Friend, When it comes to unnecessary government red tape, I think most Missourians agree we need a whole lot less of it - especially when it comes to promoting jobs and business opportunities in our state. That's why I've introduced a bill that aims to make it easier for Missouri businesses to cut through red tape on projects that will create and expand good-paying jobs. The Federal Permitting Improvement Act - which I introduced with my Republican colleague Senator Rob Portman of Ohio - would streamline and speed up the federal permitting process, which right now is bogged down by uncertainty, unpredictability, and uncoordinated federal review that hinders investment and growth. Getting bills passed through Congress these days can feel like an impossible task, but this one might be the one to break through the partisan gridlock. This week, it was approved with a bipartisan vote in the Senate Homeland Security Committee. And Bloomberg recently described it as the ""legislation seen as having the best chance of locking down enough Democrats for Senate approval,"" among more than a half-dozen bills aimed at revamping regulatory procedures. Read the full-article: Legislation to Speed Environmental Permits Seen as Best Hope Among Deregulatory Bills As I expressed when telling Bloomberg, ""we might just have a miracle here. We might have Republicans, Democrats, and the White House agree on something, and that would be extraordinary."" But the work isn't done yet. Following this week's passage through the Committee, it's on to a vote before the full Senate - when that happens I'll be sure to keep you up-to-date on the bill's final steps. We've made a lot of progress expanding job opportunities and getting folks back to work since the recession, and now isn't the time to let up. With businesses groups, trade organizations, and a growing number of Republicans and Democrats all on the same page, this is a no brainer: let's cut the red tape out of the federal permitting process and make government work faster and more efficiently in Missouri and across the country. All the best, P.S. Stay up-to-date as I work to get this bill across the finish line by finding me on Facebook, Twitter and Instagram.

Last week, I was pleased to support balanced, bipartisan legislation to honor the commitment weve made to our veterans and their families by improving VA claims processing and access to quality health care, addressing homelessness among our veterans, and continuing robust oversight over the VA. This important bill would also provide additional funding to ensure our veterans living in rural areas or those unable to get an appointment at a VA medical facility, can receive non-VA care. You can learn more about this legislation by visiting Resources for the Avian Flu Outbreak As of Tuesday, 80 farms in 21 Minnesota counties have been stricken by the avian flu epidemic. The Board of Animal Health, in partnership with the United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) and Minnesota Departments of Health, Agriculture and Public Safety, has been working over the last couple of weeks to identify infected flocks and implement health and safety measures. While no farms in the 2nd district have reported affected livestock, I have set up an information and resources page on my website at Additionally, to help address this issue, I joined my colleagues in the House in requesting the Administration expeditiously approve the USDAs request to transfer funds to help combat the outbreak.

,114,Male,N00013799,43309,"Forbes, Randy (Rep.) [R-VA4]"," In its 102 year history, the Federal Reserve has never had a complete, independent audit. This is due to the fact that some of its operations are exempt from regular audits. Congress established the Federal Reserve System in 1913 to add consistency to the economy after a series of financial panics brought instability to the banking industry. Since that point, the Federal Reserve has evolved in its governance and mission. Twice a year, the Federal Reserve Board must report to Congress on the economy and monetary policy in the United States. However, while the Government Accountability Office (GAO) is tasked with regularly reviewing the actions of the Federal Reserve, it is also prohibited under current law from including some information in its review. Additionally, the Federal Reserves budget is not subject to review by Congress. According to the Congressional Research Service, unlike most other government agencies, the Federal Reserve is self-financing so there is no congressional oversight over its budget. Since its budget is not subject to the usual appropriations or authorization process, there is no regular avenue for Congress to ensure the Fed is allocating resources according to congressional priorities. The Federal Reserve is led by a Board of Governors and these seven unelected, presidential appointed members guide the Feds policy actions, serving 14-year terms. Since many of their actions are excluded from annual, comprehensive audits, they are privy to vast decision-making authority with little scrutiny. This year, Congressman Randy Forbes has cosponsored the Federal Reserve Transparency Act (H.R.24) to audit the Federal Reserve, and recently sent a letter to Secretary of Defense Carter, requesting that the Secretary publicly outline his plan to make the Department of Defense auditable by 2017, and submit audit results to Congress by 2019, as required by the Financial Improvement and Audit Readiness Plan.

According to the U.S. Labor Department  , small businesses create two out of every three net new jobs. That's why it's essential we provide our small businesses with the certainty they need  to grow and thrive. In the U.S. House of Representatives, we have passed bipartisan bills  that help small business in a competitive economy. In the first 100 days  alone: * Congress passed the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act (H.R. 527) to scale back the regulatory red tape that burdens Main Street so that small businesses are free to grow. * Congress passed the Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act (H.R. 37), which cuts excess regulation so that small businesses have access to the capital they need to grow and create good-paying jobs. * Congress passed the Small Business Tax Relief Act (H.R. 636) that helps to reduce uncertainty from government so that small businesses can invest in their future and grow. * Congress passed the Save the American Workers Act (H.R. 30), which restores the 40-hour work week  that Obamacare's employer mandate destroyed so that small businesses can hire more workers at the hours that work for them. * Congress passed the Hire More Heroes Act (H.R. 22)  to exempt veterans from Obamacare's employer mandate threshold if they already have health care through TRICARE or the VA so that no employers are penalized for hiring a veteran and that no veteran is left jobless because of the mandate. * Congress repealed the unfair ""death tax"" (H.R. 1105)  to reform our tax system so that small businesses can be kept in the family, even when a loved one dies. As the proud representative of New Jersey's 7th District, I will continue to help small business and pass legislation  that creates good jobs along with a healthy economy for hard-working taxpayers  Best personal wishes,  Leonard Lance Member of Congress  Sent from an unattended mailbox.

[D-CA33]","News from Congressman  Visit My Website  Facebook  Twitter  YouTube  Contact Me  Dear Friends, I wanted to let you know about the work that I've been doing this week with our community partners in Southern California on the crucial issue of housing our homeless veterans. I was honored that VA Secretary Robert McDonald was in the district this week to join me as we fight to provide high-quality care to veterans in Los Angeles. You may also be interested to know that my district office specializes in helping veterans who are having difficulties with their health or housing benefits. Please don't hesitate to call us at (323) 651-1040 if we can be of any help to you or your family. Sincerely, Ted W. Lieu Member of Congress  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: May 6, 2015 CONGRESSMAN LIEU ATTENDS ANNOUNCEMENT OF THE HOMELESS VETERANS INITIATIVE WASHINGTON, DC  Today, Congressman Ted W. Lieu (D-Los Angeles) joined Veterans Affairs Secretary Robert McDonald and Douglas Guthrie, CEO of the Housing Authority of the City of Los Angeles (HACLA), for the announcement of the Homeless Veterans Initiative in Los Angeles. The Initiative is the result of collaboration between HACLA and the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) that aims to address the needs of homeless Veterans who are ineligible for HUD-VASH vouchers. We arent going to solve the crisis of Veteran homelessness if we dont solve it in Los Angeles, said Congressman Lieu. The Homeless Veterans Initiative is a unique and innovative partnership designed to make a real difference in the lives of our Veterans by ensuring that they have reliable access to healthcare and housing. Thank you Secretary McDonald, Mr. Guthrie, and Mayor Garcetti for your tireless work on this issue. I am also pleased funds from Proposition 41, of which I was a co-author, will also be used to house homeless Veterans. I stand ready to support the Homeless Veterans Initiative in any way that I can  including advocating in Congress for a fully funded VA. Veterans who are not approved for VA healthcare services cannot currently receive HUD-VASH vouchers to assist them with obtaining permanent housing. The Homeless Veterans Initiative has secured 500 Section 8 vouchers to be dedicated by the City of Los Angeles through HACLA to this vulnerable population of veterans who are not getting housing or healthcare assistance. Through this innovative program, VA employees will work out of HACLAs offices in Los Angeles so that both organizations can work together to jointly serve homeless veterans. ###  FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE: May 5, 2015 CONGRESSMAN LIEU ATTENDS OPENING OF BLUE BUTTERFLY NAVY VILLAGE HOUSING PROGRAM LOS ANGELES, CA  Today, Congressman Ted W. Lieu (D-Los Angeles) spoke at the ribbon-cutting ceremony celebrating the opening of the Blue Butterfly Navy Village Housing Program in San Pedro, California. Secretary Robert McDonald of the Department of Veterans Affairs (VA) also gave remarks at the event. I am thrilled to be here today to join Secretary McDonald and the Volunteers of America (VOA) in celebrating the completion of this incredible project, said Congressman Lieu. The Blue Butterfly Navy Village is an innovative and much-needed development that specifically addresses the needs of female veterans in the Los Angeles area. Our men and women in uniform returning home from fighting a war should not have to fight to find a safe place for their young families to sleep. The VA has reported that female veterans are the fastest-growing segment of the homeless population, and I am proud that California is taking initiative to address this. I am very grateful that President Obama, First Lady Michelle Obama and Secretary McDonald have made ending veterans homelessness a top priority. I also want to thank VOA, whose hard work, organization, and fundraising made the Blue Butterfly Navy Village possible. The Blue Butterfly Navy Village is one of the first programs in the country to specifically address the housing needs of female veterans. The village, which is built on 9 acres of land that has been converted from Navy housing, has 74 townhouses for veterans and their children. VOA spent $15 million to build the village, which will provide mental health services and after-school activities in addition to family housing. At todays event, four families received keys to their new homes at Blue Butterfly Navy Village.

,114,Male,N00013799,43309,"Forbes, Randy (Rep.) [R-VA4]"," Friend  Each year for the past sixty-four years, the President has called the American people to a day united in prayer. We call it the National Day of Prayer, and today, we celebrate it once again. As a nation, we have faced many daunting challenges throughout our history and have overcome them. We are optimistic about Americas future because throughout her history, the prayers of our people have united and sustained us across impossible odds. The first presidential call to prayer was issued by George Washington on October 3, 1789. He wrote, It is the duty of all nations to acknowledge the providence of Almighty God, to obey his will, to be grateful for his benefits, and humbly to implore his protection and favor. Since then, there have been over 130 presidential calls to prayer and, in 1952, President Harry Truman signed a law making the National Day of Prayer an annual event. In honor of this day, I, along with Speaker Boehner and Co-Chairman of the Congressional Prayer Caucus Senator Lankford, led 53 other Members of Congress in writing an open letter on why prayer is an integral aspect of our national heritage.

By working closely with Peconic Bay Medical Center and the Department of Veterans Affairs, I have secured a new healthcare facility that will offer a variety of healthcare services for veterans. The healthcare center will be located at the Gertrude and Louis Feil Campus for Ambulatory Care, at Peconic Bay Medical Centers Manorville campus, beginning Tuesday, May 5, 2015, and the facility will be open seven days a week; Monday-Friday, from 7:30 am to 9:00 pm; Saturdays from 8:00 am to 4:00 pm; and Sundays from 8:00 am to 2:00 pm. Services will include primary care for health maintenance, including disease prevention, diagnosis and treatment of acute and chronic illnesses, patient education and counseling, as well as on site specialties, including rheumatology, gastroenterology, colon and rectal surgery, general surgery, orthopedic trauma and metabolic bone disease, and soon to be introduced, nutrition therapy. You can learn more about it here: ""Hospital's Manorville location to offer veterans care  ,"" ""PBMC to offer healthcare services to veterans at Manorville facility  ,"" and ""Peconic Bay Medical Center to offer healthcare to veterans at its Manorville campus  ."" Im proud to have secured this agreement, which will increase access to care for veterans who live on Long Island's East End. After so bravely serving our country, this facility will open up an important new option for veterans while still allowing them to continue receiving other services and ongoing treatment at the VA Hospital in Northport. Fighting for our veterans who have fought for us has always been one of my top priorities, and always will be.

Issues  Press  Schedule a Meeting  facebook  you tube  tweeter   May 7, 2015 Dear Cormack, At 4:39 a.m. last Thursday, the House Armed Services Committee gaveled out of session after passing the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA)  . During this marathon markup of the annual defense authorization bill, which lays out the priorities and programs under the Defense Department, Connecticut's key priorities earned strong support. During my first NDAA markup as Ranking Member of the Seapower subcommittee, I am proud to have secured critical support for our submarine industrial base in this measure    In addition to fully supporting the two submarine build rate for the Virginia class and continued development of the Virginia Payload Module, this proposal also expands on the bipartisan work I did last year to establish the National Sea-Based Deterrence Fund. This year's bill not only directs $1.4 billion into the fund, but also provides a range of new authorities and tools to the Navy to develop and construct the Ohio Replacement submarines in the most efficient and cost-effective way possible.  Congressman Courtney recently led a delegation of Connecticut companies at the Sea Air Space Expo in Washington, where he helped connect them with military and industry representatives to explore future business opportunities. The steadfast support of submarine construction programs in this bill would not be possible without the excellent production record of the men and women of Electric Boat in Groton. The success of the Virginia Class construction program has earned the confidence of legislators in Washington, evident in the provisions included in this bill, and the recent Block IV contract that locks in the two-a-year build rate for the next four years. The 2016 NDAA fully funds the Block IV contract, and in conjunction with strong investment in the Ohio Replacement Program, will help stabilize and grow the waterfront workforce in coming years. This bill also supports a range of other important items for our state, including modernization of the Connecticut Air National Guard's fleet of C-130 cargo aircraft-the result of an amendment I offered-as well as development and investment in aircraft and helicopters built in Connecticut. Importantly, the 2016 NDAA rejects the President's request for a Base Realignment and Closure (BRAC) round. The legislation also includes items aimed at supporting the needs of our military, our troops, and our national defense, now and in the future. The threat of budget sequestration still looms over the process of approving the NDAA and our domestic budget priorities, and we must eliminate that threat to protect our nation's ability to make strategic long-term investments. Despite this environment, the bipartisan NDAA passed out of the House Armed Services Committee maintains Connecticut's status on the forefront of our national security strategy, and I will continue to work to preserve and expand our region's role as the legislative process moves forward.

WAYS AND MEANS UPDATE: FAST TRACK AND TRADE I am privileged to serve as a senior Member of the House Ways & Means Committee  . This Committee, the oldest in the House, has jurisdiction over bills relating to taxes, Social Security, Medicare, poverty, and trade. We have had a busy few weeks in the Committee. On April 22, the Committee held a hearing on trade. The next day, we met in a markup, where the Committee debates and amends proposed bills. We spent 13 hours on trade bills, including the proposed Trade Promotion Authority (TPA), H.R. 1890  . This fast track authority would allow the President to negotiate a free trade agreement  the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP)  with 11 other countries around the Pacific. Under TPA, once negotiations are completed, Congress may only vote on the full agreement and may not make any changes to the deal. During the markup, I offered an amendment  that would have clarified and strengthened human rights and labor protections. In many nations where Americans trade, workers and citizens suffer abuses that are illegal in this country. My amendment sought to encourage these nations to abide by fair and humane labor practices. You can watch my statement in the video below  , or you can read it here  . Unfortunately, my amendment failed by a party-line vote  .   I have always been and will continue to be a strong voice for American workers and jobs. Congress should ensure that any free trade agreement  especially TPP  includes enforceable labor, human rights, and environmental protections while addressing and other key issues like access to medicines, food safety, and currency manipulation. I strongly believe that TPP must be on the right track before agreeing to any fast track proposal. You can find the full markup report here  , and you can track the Committees blog  for more information on trade policy. The full Congress is expected to vote on fast track in the near future. IRS & TAXPAYER RIGHTS On April 15, I was honored to manage seven bipartisan bills on the House floor to improve the efficiency of the IRS. These seven bills all passed the House and moved to the Senate. They are good steps to making the IRS work better for all taxpayers.  In addition, I serve as the Ranking Democratic Member on the Oversight Subcommittee of the Ways & Means Committee. On April 22, we had a hearing on the just-completed IRS tax filing season. In recent years, the IRS has faced steep budget cuts that have hurt the agencys ability to do its job. During the hearing, we discussed the harm this does to American taxpayers, who are finding it harder to get help with their taxes and waiting longer for refunds. You can read my opening remarks here  . AMERICAN RESPONSE TO EARTHQUAKE IN NEPAL I have long said that we all live together in one house, not just the American house, but the world house. I know many of you have been as concerned as I have been about our brothers and sisters in Nepal since a devastating earthquake struck that country a few weeks ago. The U.S. Embassy in Kathmandu has been working with local rescue authorities to transport stranded trekkers. Embassy staff has canvassed hospitals and hotels to locate U.S. citizens in need and to provide urgent support. The U.S. Embassy and the American Club continue to shelter U.S. citizens and their family members, as well as dozens of non-Americans. The international airport in Kathmandu is open, and many U.S. citizens have left the country. The Embassy has helped U.S. citizens make flight plans out of the country and has provided shuttle services to the airport. To find out how to notify the State Department about U.S. citizens in Nepal, click here (link to sheet  must upload). More information about the earthquake in Nepal and the U.S. government response to the disaster can be found at the U.S. Embassys website  . The U.S. Agency for International Development also has useful information on its website  . Lastly, the Nepal Travel Alert  also provides guidance to American citizens in Nepal and family and friends concerned about those in the country.

,114,Male,N00002884,43319,"Hastings, Alcee (Rep.) [D-FL20]","May 2015 The Hastings Monthly Report My Sixteenth Trip to Israel This month, I was privileged to travel to Israel as the senior member of a bipartisan delegation organized by the American Israel Education Foundation (AIEF), an independent, non-profit charitable organization. This was my sixteenth trip to Israel as a Member of Congress. Given current events taking place in the region, I believe that this was an extremely important opportunity to meet with senior Israeli and Palestinian leaders on a wide range of issues concerning political developments in Israel, regional security in the Middle East, the ongoing peace process, as well as the U.S.-Israeli relationship. During the course of the trip, our delegation met with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Prime Minister Rami Hamdallah, as well as members of the Knesset, military officials, business leaders, and ordinary citizens. The visit confirmed the importance of our nations engagement with allies around the world and partners in the region to hold a firm line against Irans development of dangerous, destabilizing weapons, and to ensuring that Iran remains committed to its obligations in any post-deal environment. It also reiterated the significance of continuing to work to encourage comprehensive peace talks between Israel and the Palestinian Authority that accomplish a resolution to the decades-long conflict that ensures an enduring peace. I was delighted to have the opportunity to travel to Israel, yet again, during what is unquestionably a critical time for the region as a whole. Throughout my tenure in Congress, I have made it a priority to educate my colleagues on the importance of a strong U.S.-Israeli relationship, and our continued support of Israel's absolute right to defend itself and protect its citizens. I look forward to continuing to focus on these important issues in Congress. Congressional Briefing on ISIS Violent Treatment of Women and Girls Last week, I was proud to host a Congressional briefing, in conjunction with Representative Ted Deutch, to highlight the Islamic State of Iraq and ash-Shams (ISIS) involvement in human trafficking and the violent treatment of women and girls. Human trafficking knows no geographic borders or racial or ethnic bounds, and is a scourge which plagues every country. While media coverage of ISIS threat to regional stability has been widespread, its barbaric treatment of women and girls has received scant but critical attention. Our briefing focused on reports of the capture and trafficking of women and girls across parts of Syria and Iraq released in recent months. We were privileged to be joined by a distinguished panel of experts whose presentations were incredibly instructive with each bringing light to a dire situation that demands our attention. One thing is very clear, the scope of this tragedy is vast and the level of sexual violence encountered by these women and girls, unimaginable. In early August 2014, accounts surfaced that thousands of Yazidi and other minority groups in Iraq had been systematically targeted and kidnapped. Of the women and girls abducted, some as young as ten years old, most are treated as the spoils of war. They are often used as incentives for recruits to take up arms with ISIS or are given to soldiers as prizes at which time the women and girls are raped and beaten. This system of degradation, ISIS argues, is sanctioned under Islamic law. An argument that is as bankrupt as it is sickening. I applaud the one hundred-twenty senior Muslim scholars and Imams who have written an open letter to the senior members of ISIS, making it clear that any reading of the Koran that advocates for the enslavement and rape of women and girls is not at all a reflection of their valued book. Of course, as important as it is that we never lose sight of the fact that ISIS does not speak for the Muslim community as a whole, it is equally, if not more important in the more immediate future, that we dedicate our efforts to saving and protecting the women and girls who stand helplessly, and too often hopelessly, in the path of this horrific groups destruction. As a Member of Congress, I will continue to advocate for the voiceless, and pledge to do all I can to support efforts to provide assistance to protect civilian populations, as well as work to implement services and support for victims of sexual and gender-based violence who are able to escape from human trafficking schemes. Gun Violence in America Data recently released confirms that firearms were responsible for 33,000 deaths in America in 2013, and more than double that were injured by guns during the same period. Indeed, not a day goes by when we are not served with a reminder of the senseless loss of life caused by firearms. For this reason, I took issue with a rider that was attached to an Energy and Water appropriations bill that came before the Rules Committee in April. This legislation reversed current policy prohibiting guns on Army Corps of Engineers land and stripped the Secretary of the Army from using their discretion to determine what is best for the security of our nations infrastructure and the safety of public employees. Not only was I disturbed that Republicans sought to change our gun laws in an Energy and Water funding bill, but I was also troubled with yet another Republican attempt to make it easier for individuals to possess concealed weapons. Because, I firmly believe that something must be done about the scourge of gun violence in our country, I offered an amendment to strike this language from the comprehensive bill. My amendment was ultimately voted down by the Republicans on the Committee. At the Committee meeting, I referenced a statement made by David Satcher, who served as the U.S. Surgeon General from 1998 to 2002. Surgeon General Satcher proclaimed that youth violence is an epidemic, in response to a report he commissioned in 2002. At the time the study was conducted it revealed that thirteen children died each day as a result of gun violence. Indeed, the gun violence epidemic that plagues our nation has not diminished in recent years. Our current Surgeon General, Vivek Murthy, has famously insisted that gun violence in our country is a public health crisis. I want to make clear that as an attorney and former federal judge, I believe that the second amendment bestows a right upon citizens to own firearms, and as a long time gun owner, I support the need to protect the rights of responsible gun owners. At the same time, it is essential that we do more to ensure that dangerous weapons are kept out of the hands of the wrong individuals. Very recently, a two-year-old Florida boy fatally shot himself in the chest after finding his fathers gun. Similarly, a mother in South Florida was shot by her three-year-old child when he gained access to her semi-automatic weapon. We must do more to ensure that incidents like these do not continue to occur. I will work diligently this Congress to call attention to the gun violence that plagues our country, while supporting efforts to find legislative solutions.

[D-MD6]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email  News from Representative John Delaney  May 7, 2015 Dear Friend, One of my top priorities is to bring constituent concerns to our nation's capital. This week I hosted roundtables in Frederick and Hagerstown and public office hours where I met one-on-one with constituents about their ideas. As a lawmaker, it's my job to help our state succeed, and this week's events were a chance to hear directly from Maryland families about the challenges they face. If you weren't able to attend this week's events, take a moment to let me know what your priorities are for Congress  . Constituents Share Stories at Infrastructure Roundtable In March, I asked local residents to share stories on the impact that inadequate infrastructure has in their communities, and since then more than 300 constituents have written in with their experiences. This week, I hosted an infrastructure roundtable with local residents who told their stories in person. As the Highway Trust Fund, our nation's largest source of federal infrastructure projects, nears insolvency, I've called on Congress to put partisanship aside and address this problem. My roundtable in Frederick brought together constituents from across the districts who shared some eye-opening stories on the problems caused by inadequate infrastructure. From Beth, whose commute made it difficult to spend time with her family, to Magnus, a contractor who sees the business impact of inadequate infrastructure investments every day, the constituents I met with made it clear that's time for Congress to act. Here in the House, I've introduced legislation which combines tax reform with investments in our nation's infrastructure. My bill would put the Highway Trust Fund back on stable ground for the next six years and create an American infrastructure Fund to help to address the infrastructure problems that Beth and Magnus face on a day-to-day basis. Hearing from Students in Frederick and Smithsburg This Tuesday, I joined students at Frederick Community College for a discussion on government and public service. During our discussion, I heard questions from students on how we can help to make college more affordable. If we want to give young Americans a competitive edge in today's global economy, we need to remove the barriers between our youngest generation and higher education and technical training.  Delaney meets with students at Frederick Community College Here in the House, I've cosponsored legislation to increase funding for Pell Grants, which provide need-based assistance to students seeking a higher education, and I've introduced legislation that would make student loans dischargeable in bankruptcy. With more than $1 trillion in student debt nationwide, it's time for reform that ensures all students have access to an affordable higher education. On Wednesday, I joined students at Smithsburg High School for a talk on civics and government. A strong understanding of civics is critical to the function of our democracy, and I was happy to join students at Smithsburg High to talk about the mechanics of Congress. I was inspired to hear from our next generation of leaders. Meeting One-on-One at Public Office Hours This week I also hosted Public Office Hours in Hagerstown, giving me an opportunity to hear directly from constituents about their top priorities. During my office hours, I met one-one-one with constituents and discussed topics including jobs and the local economy, the federal workforce, retirement, election reform, and improving customer service at federal agencies. Every day, my district offices in Hagerstown and Gaithersburg assist constituents with a diverse set of issues. Whether you're looking for help with a federal agency, or you have legislative concerns you'd like to discuss, take a moment to connect with my caseworkers online. You can also call our offices at Hagerstown at (301) 733-2900 or Gaithersburg at (301) 926-0300. As I continue my work in the House, I encourage you to stay up-to-date by joining me on Facebook  and following me on Twitter  . I look forward to staying in touch.

For example, this week marks National Small Business Week, and I have been visiting local companies to highlight the entrepreneurs and small business owners that impact our communities and to chat with them about how best the federal government can provide support. Read about some of these recent visits in this weeks edition of Congress in Your Inbox. Last week, my colleagues and I on the Armed Services Committee spent a marathon session finalizing the annual National Defense Authorization Act , which sets policy for the military. More than a dozen provisions I authored were part of the bill, impacting issues such as gender-specific gear to our local Massachusetts military installations. Included in the NDAA was a bill that I recently introduced with Congressman Mike Turner (R-OH). The Support Uniformed Patriots; Prevent Offenses and Restore Trust Act (SUPPORT Act) will improve support for survivors of military sexual assault. Specifically, to prevent assaults, encourage reporting, provide quality services, and reform the military justice system that too often fails survivors of these crimes. The NDAA is expected to be voted on by the full House of Representatives in the coming weeks. Also in this weeks newsletter, you can watch my speech on the House Floor on the Armenian Genocide anniversary and you can read my OpEd about National Parks.

Second Circuit ruling on Section 215 of the Patriot Act >From day one following the revelation of the NSA's bulk collection program, I have said that the warrantless collection of records on all Americans violates both the Fourth Amendment to the Constitution and the plain reading of Section 215 of the Patriot Act. Today's Second Circuit ruling  makes clear that the executive branch's interpretation of the statute--interpreting records ""relevant"" to a terrorism investigation to mean all records everywhere--is ""unprecedented and unwarranted."" In light of this ruling  , Congress must not proceed with the latest version of the USA Freedom Act. While limiting certain types of bulk collection, the latest USA Freedom Act would authorize bulk collection of Americans' records for the first time, thereby undoing some of the progress resulting from the Second Circuit's decision. Instead, Congress should pass, and the president should sign, the original USA Freedom Act  , as introduced in 2013 before amendments, that protects the liberty and privacy of all Americans while providing the intelligence community the authority necessary to deal with those who seek to harm us. Rep. Amash greets veterans at the World War II Memorial in Washington, D.C.

Last week I met members of Kansas Honor Flight No. 24 at the Wichita Eisenhower airport as they departed on their trip, and again when they visited the Vietnam Memorial in Washington, D.C. Kansas Honor Flight arranges these experiences and sends our veterans to Washington, D.C. to visit their own war memorial. These memorials exist to proclaim that the liberties we enjoy today were earned through the bravery and sacrifice of many patriotic American soldiers. It is always such a blessing to meet these heroes. And great fun.

,114,Male,N00034041,43591,"Massie, Thomas (Rep.) [R-KY4]"," For Immediate Release Lorenz.Isidro@mail.house.gov Friday May 8, 2015 (202) 225-3465 BuzzFeed: This Kentucky Conservative Owns A Tesla, Lives Off The Grid, And Is Democrats New Go-To Republican By Kate Nocera The original BuzzFeed profile can be viewed here. WASHINGTON  Shortly after Thomas Massie arrived in Congress, the freshman Republican sought out Zoe Lofgren  a liberal from California  on the House floor. He wanted to know if electric car company Tesla was in her district because he proudly owned one and he charged his car with solar panels at his home. Tesla isnt in Lofgrens district (its just outside of it), but the conversation left her baffled. Massie is from a deeply conservative Kentucky district. I thought well, thats interesting, let me find out some more about this guy, Lofgren recalled. The pair struck up an unlikely friendship after Lofgren pitched him on several technology bills shed been working on. Theyve continued to be some of the loudest (and at times effective) voices in Congress on curbing surveillance programs. Increasingly, in fact, Massie has become a go-to member of the Republican conference for Democratic members looking for a GOP member to sponsor legislation on everything from surveillance, to industrial hemp, to cell-phone unlocking legislation. Some Democrats have also teamed up with him on a raw-milk bill he recently introduced in Congress. These are the areas that typically unite libertarians and liberals in Congress but Massie, a self-described crunchy con, arrived in the House with the reputation for being the kind of Tea Party Republican liberals revile. Hes an ardent supporter of gun rights and has several times introduced legislation to undo some of the District of Columbias gun laws. He regularly votes against government spending and has a near perfect voting score from both FreedomWorks and Heritage Action. But his early opposition to surveillance programs have drawn him accolades from the Democratic side of the aisle, as has his willingness to buck his party leadership. And as the House and Senate attempt to re-authorize portions of the PATRIOT Act in the coming month, Massie plans on being at the center of that debate  again with a Democrat. He recently introduced a bill with Wisconsin Democrat Mark Pocan to repeal that 2001 law passed in the wake of 9/11 and overhaul many of the NSAs surveillance programs. Sometimes people can confuse partisans with ideologues, Massie said in an interview. Heres the difference between a partisan and an ideologue: An ideologue reads the bill, every word, period and section; a partisan reads the whip recommendation. No one should ever confuse me with a partisan; Im clearly an ideologue. That means if something I care about lines up with something a Democrat cares about theres nothing that gets in the way of us working together, he said. Massie is not particularly well-liked by Republican leadership. Hes twice voted against John Boehner for speaker. Hes at the center of a group of Republicans that tends to infuriate his conference leadership and wont hesitate to vote against their priorities if he doesnt agree with them. Hes proud of all of that and smiles broadly when he notes that hell never be the guy on a conference committee or a committee chairman. Massie does things differently in the House, perhaps because his path to politics was pretty unique: He graduated from MIT with degrees in engineering, started a technology company, sold that company, and moved back to Kentucky with his wife, Rhonda, where they now live entirely off-the-grid on a cattle farm. He was elected in a 2012 special election out of a seven-way primary in a heavily Republican district and has been the thorn in the side Boehner and his allies ever since. That hasnt stopped Democrats from believing that hes sometimes their best option for getting their legislation through the House. Last June, Lofgren convinced Massie to take on the role as lead sponsor of an amendment to a major defense bill that would to end so called back door searches by the NSA. Massie understood that his standing with leadership might have hurt her case more than it would help it, so he tried to convince four other Republicans to take the lead sponsorship role. When they all declined, he decided to do it. Lofgren and others had done the lions share of work on the amendment but she said she truly believed it needed to be a bipartisan bill in order to get traction on the floor. He had the guts to put his name on it. Afterward, he said, I feel bad because you did the work on it, but he had the guts to put his name on it, she said. In a late night vote, the amendment ended up passing with a veto-proof majority. That was really the highwater mark for me, Massie said. Our feeling with that bill was it had to have a Republican sponsor as the primary sponsor. I hope that Im never in the minority but I say to my Democrat friends, If Im ever in the minority, please put your name on one of my bills so that it has a snowballs chance in hell of passing. Its incredibly unlikely some of Massies legislation  particularly his bill with Pocan to repeal the PATRIOT Act  would ever pass the House, let alone get through the Senate. But putting Massies name on a bill could have other benefits: Massie is able to tout the legislation in places Democrats wont go. FreedomWorks has been supportive of Massies work on surveillance, as has pundit Glenn Beck. The outside groups are very interested in what Im doing. Theres an ad on Glenn Becks show everyday that FreedomWorks is running about [the surveillance state repeal act], he said. I dont think a Democrat could go to FreedomWorks and say, hey can you promote my bill? I didnt ask them to promote it but it makes it easier for those groups to support something like this when theres a Republican like me on the bill. I mentioned Mark Pocan and Zoe Lofgren on Glenn Becks show last week and it was in a nice way, but I thought, man, Im going to get them in trouble, he said laughing.

Keep reading to learn more about what happened this week, or if youd like to receive the updates in this eNewsletter (and more) as they happen, simply like my Facebook page  .

Reducing Infant Mortality in Memphis Growing Memphis Jobs and Honoring Poland during Memphis in May Supporting Memphis Minority Small Businesses Mourning the Loss of a Companion Pushing for Smarter Enforcement of Drug Laws  Grants for Memphis  Dont Miss the World War II Victory Capitol Flyover Reducing Infant Mortality in Memphis  Yesterday morning, I spoke at the Shelby County Health Departments 2015 Infant Mortality Summit. The infant mortality rate in Memphis is woefully high, and some ZIP codes have rates as high as those in third world countries. We not only have food deserts in our Memphis communities, but we have health care deserts as well. I am disappointed that the Tennessee General Assembly has neglected to expand TennCare coverage to 280,000 Tennesseans, as that would go a long way towards improving the situation here, but I am glad that the Affordable Care Act is helping fund new clinics, like one in Raleigh, that are providing care to those who otherwise would not have access to it and are helping us fight infant mortality in Memphis. Read more about the summit here  . While there, I also praised Shelby County Health Department Director Yvonne Madlock for her work and leadership on infant mortality. She has done yeomans work on this issue and I rue her upcoming retirement. Director Madlock and I talked about having more access to healthcare, which would happen if the Legislature expanded Medicaid, would bring down infant mortality. Growing Memphis Jobs and Honoring Poland during Memphis in May  At the Memphis World Trade Club & Greater Memphis Chambers Memphis in May Luncheon yesterday, along with former Ambassador to Poland, former Knoxville Mayor and former State Senate colleague of mine Victor Ashe (left) I welcomed Polish Ambassador Ryszard Schnepf (center) to our city. Poland is one of our most important trade partners in Europe and as the 8th largest exporting state in the nation, our relationship with them is critical to boosting our economy and creating jobs here in Memphis. I look forward to working with the Ambassador to encourage trade and tourism between Memphis and Poland, as well as to helping facilitate the visa process for Polish visitors to the US. Supporting Memphis Minority Small Businesses Its National Small Business Week. Do you have big dreams for your small or minority-owned business? The Minority Business Development Center in Memphis that I led efforts to launch in 2012 can provide assistance with setting up contracts, developing your workforce, and counseling. Small Business Administration partners like SCORE, Small Business Development Centers (SBDC), and Womens Business Centers (WBC) can provide assistance to help entrepreneurs realize the dream of business ownership as well. Find one in Memphis here  . Mourning the Loss of a Companion  This week, I lost my pet/companion Callie after a fight with kidney failure and a tumor. Her loss has been very, very difficult for me but I was so fortunate to have had a great and compassionate veteranarian, Dr. Chuck Halford, help us through the process. He and Dr. Kathy Mitchener, Cals cancer specialist and acupuncturist, made her life better and longer as did Laurie Stark, Susan Sowell, Beverly Marerro, Stephanie Dunavant and Rick Maynard who looked in on her while I was away. When you are a legislator in Nashville or DC, it takes a village to take care of your beloved cat. Henry Turley, who has always been there for me, came by and helped as Callie departed and we buried her near Hugh, my other cat pal. Pushing for Smarter Enforcement of Drug Laws I joined Congressmen Jared Polis of Colorado and Earl Blumenauer of Oregon and several other colleagues late last week in sending a letter urging President Obama to nominate a new Drug Enforcement Administration chief who would bring a smarter, more progressive approach to the agency and to enforcement of minor drug crimes while focusing on the drug crimes that actually cause societal harm. You can read more about the letter here  . Grants for Memphis On Monday, I announced almost $1.9 million in federal funding for six research projects at UT Health Science Center in Memphis. These significant federal investments, which you can read more about here  , will help keep Memphis and the UT Health Science Center at the forefront of the medical research community. Dont Miss the World War II Victory Capitol Flyover Today marks the 70th Anniversary of VE Day, the day the United States and its allies celebrated victory over the Nazis in Europe. To commemorate this anniversary and honor the sacrifice made by our veterans there will be an aircraft parade in Washington this morning, just like the parades that occurred around the world following our victory in 1945. The Arsenal of Democracy World War II Victory Capitol Flyover will consist of more than 50 World War II-era planes flying over several monuments along the National Mall, including the World War II Memorial, and the U.S. Capitol building.

The 93rd Congress got a head-start appropriating the governments funds in April of 1974. Once finished, these Members went on to pass the Family Educational Rights and Privacy Act (FERPA) and Disaster Relief Act  both of which still benefit Americans today. Like those in the 93rd Congress, I am excited to begin the appropriations process as soon as possible so that we can accomplish much more by the end of the session. Last week, Congress set the framework by passing the first bicameral GOP budget agreement in a decade. This budget, which encompasses the twelve appropriations categories, will cut $5.3 trillion in spending, repeal Obamacare, and balance within ten years. After establishing this blueprint, we debated and passed the first two of twelve appropriations bills. The Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act provides annual funding for the nations energy programs and water infrastructure. It boosts nuclear national security, rolls back overregulation, and invests in the efficiency of fossil, nuclear, and renewable energy. Better yet, all of these goals are accomplished for millions of dollars less than the Presidents request. The second bill we passed, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, funds the housing, training, and equipping of military personnel, as well as veterans benefits and programs. Under this legislation, veterans programs would receive 5.6 percent more funding than they did this year, and VA claims would be processed faster through an electronic system and a larger staff. I believe that appropriating taxpayer money should be done wisely and efficiently, but it should not span the entirety of our Congress. I am encouraged by the progress weve made with energy and military affairs, and I will work to pass the remaining ten bills with expediency and discernment. As always, it is an honor to be your voice in Congress. Sincerely, Steve Russell  At a town hall meeting in Del City, I spoke with members of the community about pressing concerns and top political issues.  I helped reinforce the importance of a healthy diet at the Jasmine Moran Children's Museum in Seminole, OK.

Honoring Colonel Powell I had a wonderful evening Thursday at a dinner honoring Colonel Charles Powell. Col. Powell and his wife, Joanne, are close friends and it was a joy to be there to celebrate as he was named a Texas Southwest Council Distinguished Citizen. Col. Powell's life of service and sacrifice exemplifies the type of citizens we need to emulate and the citizen we all ought to aspire to be. Congratulations and happy birthday to an extraordinary man.

Let me share with you a few highlights from this busy, bustling district work period. On Monday, I was honored to join CLARCORP at the groundbreaking of their finished plant expansion project in Lee's Summit. Together with Keith White, President of CLARCORP; Chris Ferraro, VP CLARCORP; John Reuss, VP CLARCORP and Mayor of Lee's Summit Randy Rhoads, I helped cut the ribbon to mark this new beginning. The Lee's Summit CLARCORP plant manufactures packing materials for military and public applications. This truly fits into what we need to be doing in our district and around the country  making it in America. We must strengthen American manufacturing and help businesses grow and create jobs here. This way, we can set our country on a solid path toward greater economic competitiveness, job creation, and long-term economic growth. On Wednesday, this year's National Bike to School Day, I visited Whittier Elementary in the Historic Northeast to highlight bike safety and student health. I rode up 10th street with Dr. Green, KCPS Superintendent, Jermaine Reed, 3rd District Councilman, Luis Hinojosa, Whittier Elementary Principal and several students from Whittier. As a father and grandfather, I could not help but share a bit of advice: always eat healthy foods and wear helmets when you ride your bikes. The first-ever National Bike to School Day took place on May 9, 2012, in coordination with the League of American Bicyclists' National Bike Month. Together, we can maintain a healthy lifestyle, protect our environment, and enjoy the outdoors. And yesterday, on Thursday, I was delighted to be with my friends at The Crown in Odessa to celebrate the National Day of Prayer. Presidents Harry Truman, Ronald Reagan and Bill Clinton signed laws to designate and recognize the National Day of Prayer. This year, President Obama followed that tradition and designated May 6, 2015, as our National Day of Prayer.

As a member of the Armed Services Committee, I play a role in writing the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), critical legislation that sets policy for the Pentagon. This year I was proud to have 13 of my proposals accepted in the Fiscal Year 2016 NDAA during Committee consideration. Among these provisions were four amendments that I introduced with former Small Business Committee Chairman Sam Graves (R-MO) that will help make it easier for small businesses to compete for government contracts. These proposals will provide greater accountability for senior agency executives who are responsible for overseeing small business subcontracting, remove barriers to capital for small businesses, improve training for small business advocates and allow more small businesses to compete for federal construction contracts. These amendments all passed the Armed Services Committee unanimously. Representative Graves and I will introduce another amendment during consideration of the NDAA on the House Floor next week to increase small business contracting goals for the Department of Defense. I also believe we have an obligation to promote the growth of small businesses owned by Veterans. Those who defended our great country deserve to have access to the resources they need for their businesses to grow and succeed. That is why last week, I introduced the Veterans Small Business Enhancement Act with Congressman Paul Cook (R-CA). The bill would allow eligible, Veteran-owned small businesses to select and receive excess federal property that agencies do not need, like computers, office furniture, agricultural tools and construction equipment. This bill will not only give Veteran entrepreneurs an extra opportunity to succeed and grow their businesses, but will also save taxpayer money. As a member of the House Small Business Caucus, I firmly believe Congress should be doing everything it can to create an environment that allows small businesses to invest, grow and create jobs and I think these common sense ideas are a good start.

,114,Male,N00030026,43483,"Luetkemeyer, Blaine (Rep.) [R-MO3]","Growing up as a young man working on my familys farm and then going on to own my own small business, celebrating National Small Business Week is particularly special to me. Working on my small family farm and learning the trials and tribulations of owning my own business taught me the importance of working hard  and that as a small business owner, you are often the first one to work each day and the last one paid. Each year I look forward to National Small Business Week because it serves as a way for us to focus on the importance of small business employers, their employees, and the products and services they offer. Whenever I travel through central and eastern Missouri and stop to talk with small businesses, I greatly enjoy hearing the triumphant stories of how businesses have blossomed. However, often those conversations are shadowed with the overbearing and counter-productive government regulation that keeps them from growing even more. The House of Representatives is working hard to push against the administrations regulations. Earlier this year, the House voted on the Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvement Act. This bill would ensure that government agencies are completing the proper cost-benefit and economic analyses when proposing rules that affect not only small businesses, but businesses of all sizes. This bill also increases the transparency of the rule-making process by requiring agencies to provide a detailed summary outlining the disproportionate effects the proposed rule would have on small businesses. This bill and other pieces of legislation the House has already passed, is intended to level the playing field for our nations small businesses. The endless regulations coming out of Washington are often given little to no thought from bureaucrats who probably have not worked in a small business before. And the implications these regulations have on our nations small businesses are very real. However, Americans are resilient and I know the entrepreneurial spirit is still out there. As vice chair of the House Small Business Committee, I have heard from small business folks around the nation that, while they are facing many hard times, the spirit is still alive and well. The motivation and dedication of our small business friends, and the people that work for them, is at the heart of economic growth and prosperity. As a member of Congress, I take my role seriously to support policies that enhance opportunities for entrepreneurs by providing conditions that set-up folks for success.

Dear Friend, Thank you for signing up to receive my email newsletter. These newsletters will cover a variety of topics, including events happening in Indiana, legislation being considered in Congress, and my perspective on current issues. My hope is to keep you updated and informed on how issues in Washington may impact Hoosiers. I welcome your feedback. Thanks for reading, Dan Coats _____ Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act Passes Senate  The Senate passed the Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act this week in a 98 to 1 vote. The legislation would give Congress a role in evaluating any nuclear deal with Iran and now heads to the House of Representatives for consideration. This bill is the only chance Congress has to prevent President Obama from having a free and independent hand to conclude a flawed agreement with Iran. This vote sends a strong message to the White House that Congress has deep concerns about the agreement the administration is negotiating with Iran. I regard this to be the most consequential issue of my entire public career so I am pleased this important legislation passed with strong bipartisan support. The passage of this bill could very well alter the course of history. In remarks on the Senate floor this week, I outlined what I believe are the consequences of failing to pass this bill: No congressional review period before implementation; No opportunity for Congress to vote on the agreement; No limitation on the President's use of waivers to suspend the sanctions we put in place; No requirement that Congress receive the deal at all, never mind the classified annexes that go with it; No requirement that the President certify Iran is complying; No mechanism for Congress to rapidly re-impose sanctions in the event of violations; and No reporting on Iran's support for terrorism, ballistic missile development, and human rights violations. Click here  or on the image above to watch my speech on the Senate floor. _____ Pumpkin Donut Marketing Paid for by Taxpayers  In my weekly ""Waste of the Week"" speech, I discussed a grant program that allows the Secretary of Agriculture to award competitive grants to farmers for marketing opportunities. Through this program, taxpayers are funding a variety of projects, including processing olives into olive oil, developing and marketing sparkling wine and hard cider, marketing goat's milk cheese and soap and providing organic chicken meat to restaurants. Another recipient received a $44,700 grant to increase sales of its pumpkins and squash - including pumpkin donuts - as nutritious, locally-produced food. The federal government should not choose which farmers need taxpayer dollars to market their products. Picking winners and losers distorts the role of government and, even worse, wastes taxpayer dollars in doing so. Over the past ten years, this program handed out over $290 million. This is a pretty sweet deal for grant recipients but pretty expensive for the taxpayer. Click here  or on the image above to watch this week's installment of Waste of the Week.

""Women's Economic Security: It's a Family Thing,""  shows that while women have made great strides in the workplace over the last several decades, more remains to be done, and when women succeed economically, families and communities do as well. This week, I took the show on the road and spoke with hard working women and families across our region about the challenges to their economic security.  I spoke with women entrepreneurs in Galesburg. I visited child care centers in Peoria and Rockford and the Boys and Girls Club in Moline to see what we can do to expand access to flexible and affordable child care for working parents. I spoke with a group of 4th grade girls in Rock Falls who are learning computer coding so they can one day break into a good-paying and male-dominated industry. And I shadowed women business owners for ""Cheri on Shift"" events in East Moline in Peoria. I will take the concerns I heard this week back to Washington with me and continue to work hard each day to increase economic opportunities, not only for working women, but for all hard working families across our region, state and country.

Without your strength and dedication, our nation would not be what it is today. This Mothers Day, please accept my heartfelt thanks for the endless love and caring attention that you give so freely. The biggest development of this month was the reintroduction of my annual Shrink our Spending program. Additionally, the House took up proposals to address the budget, protect religious liberty, reform taxes, and began the appropriations process. In fact, the last time the federal appropriations process was started this early was almost 50 years ago! Read below for more information on the latest developments in Washington.

Working to Save Your Tax Dollars The government spends a ridiculous amount of money on wasteful projects and agencies that do nothing for the citizens. Last year, I set out to address this abuse by embarking on my Shrink our Spending (SOS) initiative. By just looking at the most egregious programs, I was able to propose cutting over $2 billion from the budget. Sure that wont solve our debt problem, but it would be a great first step. This year, Im aiming higher. As a part of my new program, Ill be aiming to find $3 billion in cuts. You can learn more at  or by watching the video below.  Meetings with Asia-Pacific Dignitaries As Chairman of the Subcommittee on Asia and the Pacific, I have the responsibility to monitor the State Departments budgetary allocations in this region of the world. To better understand where our priorities should be, Ive spent the past months meeting with State Department officials as well as ambassadors and dignitaries from several Asia-Pacific nations to discuss how the United States can be a friend and ally in the region's economic and political growth.  Supporting Nepal in their Time of Need In late April, a magnitude 7.8 earthquake rocked the nation of Nepal. In response to the earthquake, I introduced a House Resolution expressing the condolences of the United States to the people of Nepal, and calling on our government to do all that we can to assist them recover and rebuild. You can read the full text of the resolution here.  Legislative Update: This month, in addition to those passed by voice-vote, the House passed, and I voted in favor of, the following bills: * H.R. 650 - the Preserving Access to Manufactured Housing Act of 2015  * H.R. 685 - the Mortgage Choice Act of 2015  * H.R. 622 - the State and Local Sales Tax Deduction Fairness Act of 2015  * H.R. 1105 - the Death Tax Repeal Act of 2015  * H.R. 1195 - the Bureau of Consumer Financial Protection Advisory Boards Act  * The Conference Report to Accompany S.Con.Res. 11  The FY 2016 U.S. Budget  * H.R. 2029 - the Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016  * H.J.Res 43 - a resolution disapproving the action of the District of Columbia Council in approving the Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act of 2014  * H.R. 2028 - the Energy and Water Development and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2016  >From the Fifth District Congressional Medalist at Skyline High School I joined American History students at Skyline High School to discuss the role of government and present Audry Tapia with the Congressional Silver Media Award.

,114,Male,N00030676,43554,"Long, Billy (Rep.) [R-MO7]","Congressman Billy Long ====================================== I had the pleasure this week of visiting several southwest Missouri manufacturers and seeing firsthand the great products created right here in our district. On Thursday, I toured the Springfield Coach Group, where they buy new cars and proceed to cut them in half to turn into limousines. I also visited the National Audio Company, which makes a lot of products for the Library of Congress in Washington. Then it was on to Leggett & Platt Flex-O-Lators factory in Carthage and New Aire Fireplace Systems in Carl Junction. Friday, I attended a groundbreaking ceremony in Ozark for Springfield-based Allen Global Companies and celebrated its expansion into Kazakhstan. Federal trade and foreign affairs policy have a central place in many of these businesses as well as numerous others around the district. Over the past five years,12 businesses [link 1]in the Seventh District have received Export-Import Bank assistance, helping southwest Missouri-made products make it to the global market. I co-sponsor abill [link 2]to reauthorize Ex-Im through 2019 and allow for continued success from Missouri businesses abroad. Trade partnerships build foreign relationships and open doors for American businesses, such as Allen Global. I hosted Kazakhstan Ambassador Kariat Umarov in August 2014 to tour Ozarks businesses including Allen Global, which ultimately led to its expansion of Allen Filtration Eurasia, which will soon distribute southwest-Missouri-made products to Kazakh companies. The U.S. and Kazakhstan have mutually benefited from our 22-year-old trade partnership, with the perks now seen here in the Ozarks. Also important is Trade Promotion Authority, which is currently being crafted in Congress and would bring us a step closer to solidifying trade deals to benefit the American workforce and elevate Americas standing on the world stage. Specifically, manufactures such as Leggett & Platt, Springfield Coach Builders and Allen Filtration that do business overseas stand to benefit from growing trade partnerships abroad, with a better chance of opening their products to and accessing new markets. With more than 815,000 jobs in Missouri tied to trade, southwest Missouri families and workers would certainly feel the benefits of streamlined trade negotiation. All in all, hard work has shaped our American history. It is a priority of mine to help Americas manufacturers have the steam to forge a strong future. The best way we can build that reality is to cut Washingtons unnecessary red tape, create a tax structure that encourages business and maintain a strong, open global trade. I will remain a staunch advocate for policies to help business, create jobs and grow our economy.

Rural Outreach Yesterday, I joined the Gadsden County Board of Commissioners, Representative Alan Williams and Senator Bill Montford in designating Highway 90 West as the James Harold Thompson Highway. Mr. Thompson represented Gadsden County in the State House from 1970-1991 and served as Speaker of the House from 1985-1986. He's a role model for representing rural counties and for working with others to get things done for our constituents.  Honoring our Military Divers  Did you know all of our nation's military branches train their divers right here in Panama City? When I'm in Washington, it fills me with pride to tell other members of the House Armed Services Committee that North Florida is the home of military diving. Just last week, I was working to amend the National Defense Authorization Act to have 2015 recognized as the Year of the Military Diver by Congress! I was honored to recognize our divers Wednesday at the Military Diver Celebration and open house at Naval Support Activity Panama City. I'm especially proud of all the hard work Commander Hung Cao is doing, not only running the best dive school in the world, but also working to make it known across the country that Panama City is the home of military diving. Constituent Corner Tallahassee's Honor Flight provides World War II veterans the amazing opportunity of flying to Washington and seeing the National World War II Memorial erected in their honor. Most of them have never seen the memorial, and would have difficulty flying to DC without this amazing organization's help. Training to volunteer for the flight, I found out veteran Brian Staub was at risk of missing the trip to Washington because he didn't have a valid ID card. I've promised to make constituent services a high priority, so I personally got involved to help. My husband and I took Brian to the local DMV and worked with the staff there to ensure he got the help he needed. With his card in hand, we boarded the flight with dozens of other veterans on Saturday morning and flew to Washington to visit the National World War II Memorial. Not only did our veterans get to see the monuments, they also met Senator Bob Dole, a war hero and true public servant.  Brian, Gwen and Senator Bob Dole Our freedom is dependent on those who risked their lives to defend our country, and in Congress, I'm working to make sure we care for all those who served.

,114,Male,N00001633,43366,"Pitts, Joseph (Rep.) [R-PA16]","The Importance of Trade One out of every five jobs in the United States, around 38 million, depend upon trade. In Pennsylvania alone, 1.6 million jobs depend on trade. According to the U.S. Trade Representative, every additional billion dollars in American exported goods means 6,000 more American jobs. Every billion dollars of service exports supports more than 4,500 jobs. Without customers, businesses fail, people lose their jobs, and families can lose their livelihood. Government restrictions on imports only forces Pennsylvanians either to buy goods they dont want, which usually means making them pay more. That is a waste of hard-earned money. Read more in this weeks OP-ED. Horseracing Legislation In 1978, Congress authorized interstate gambling and pari-mutuel wagering on horse racing. Since that time, the horse racing industry has been plagued by corruption, animal abuse, and rampant cheating. The vast majority of race horses are drugged on race days, and about two dozen of them die on race tracks each week. Jockeys have been injured, and even killed, when horses breakdown and collapse during races. That is why, two days before the Kentucky Derby, I joined with Democrat Senator Tom Udall of New Mexico to introduce legislation that would take back this privilege of wagering that Congress granted exclusively to this troubled industry. Congress authorized this wagering with the understanding that the industry would conduct horse racing with integrity and uniform rules, including no drugs on race day, but that understanding has been proven wrong for decades. Senate Passes Iran Nuclear Agreement Review Act On Thursday, the Senate passed, by a vote of 98 to 1, a bill to require any agreement which President Obama reaches with the Islamic Republic of Iran regarding their nuclear program, to be reviewed by Congress before enactment. Under this legislation, Congress would vote not whether to approve the agreement, but vote whether to disapprove of it. The bill would also require the President to notify Congress within ten days of any Iranian breach of the agreement. Iran is generally estimated to be two to three months away from obtaining a nuclear weapon. This possibility is a threat to us all, not only to those in the Middle East, but to the peace and stability of the world. Celebrating the 70th V-E Day Friday, May 8, is V-E Day. Washington, D.C. celebrated with a fly-over of the National Mall and the Capitol by dozens of planes from the World War II Era grouped into 15 formations. We must all honor and respect every veteran who has served this country, and to recall the indispensable role of the United States in safeguarding the world from fascism in the 1940s. As a veteran, I thank all of my fellow veterans, and all of those now serving our country. It may be said of our veterans what Winston Churchill said of his Royal Air Force, that never in human conflict was so much owed by so many to so few.

[R-OK1]","May 2015 Newsletter ** Bipartisan Legislation to Bolster U.S.-Israel Defense System ------------------------------------------------------------ In April, I introduced bipartisan legislation along with Representatives Derek Kilmer (D-WA) to keep the Davids Sling U.S.-Israel missile defense system moving forward. Davids Sling is a mid-range defense system designed to take down missiles from more than 180 miles away. The bill would ensure continued support for the Davids Sling system, a joint project between the United States and Israel. Once operational, Davids Sling will be used to defend against medium and long range rockets and missiles. In Israel, the system would be used to supplement the existing Iron Dome system that protects against short range rocket attacks. The technology could also be used by the American military to keep our service members safe when deployed overseas. The joint project will further develop relationships between both nations, and has the potential to create new jobs in both countries. Israel faces an immediate and growing missile threat. Hamas and Hezbollah and their supporters in Iran and Syria are developing more sophisticated and longer range missiles aimed squarely against our best ally in the Middle East. We recently witnessed the impressive performance of Iron Dome against short-range terrorist rockets. Davids Sling will provide additional protection by intercepting incoming missiles too far out of range for the Iron Dome. U.S.-Israeli co-development of Davids Sling demonstrates the unshakable American commitment to Israels security.

[R-CA10]","US Congressman Jeff Denham, Proudly Serving You in Congress Dear Friend, After months of planning it was great to host the 2015 Central Valley Job Fair and Veterans Summit in Modesto yesterday. We welcomed over a thousand job seekers to the Sportsmen of Stanislaus Club to meet with 50 employers. Importantly, we had over a hundred veterans register to attend the fair. I believe that in order to help a vet, you have to hire a vet, and it was great seeing not only our veterans but also so many local organizations dedicated to hiring veterans. The key campaign of the Veterans Jobs Caucus, which I co-chair in Congress, is I Hire Veterans. Our goal is to encourage businesses to hire our former servicemen and women, who have exemplary skills that translate to the workplace, sometimes even more easily our vets expect! I want to thank the organizations who helped with yesterdays fair: the Stanislaus Business Alliance/Alliance Worknet, the Alliance Small Business Center, CALVET, the Central Valley Human Resources Management Association, the Employment Development Department, Gallo Vets, the Heavy Equipment College of California, the Stanislaus County Veteran Employment Committee, the Vet Center, Wells Fargo Bank, and Work for Warriors. Our job fairs are an annual event so email me here [link 1] if youd like to hear about the next one. On Tuesday evening I honored 25 students from high schools across the Central Valley at the annual Congressional Merit Awards. Each award recipient was nominated by their high schools principal for their academic achievement, leadership, involvement in extracurricular activities, school citizenship, volunteerism and community service. The Congressional Merit Award program is open to all 48 schools in the 10th district. [image = Each of these students exemplifies outstanding leadership, volunteerism, and involvement in our local community. I was proud to present the Congressional Merit Award to such an exceptional group of students and I look forward to seeing their future success. See the full list of award recipients [link 2]. To commemorate National Small Business Week, I visited several small businesses throughout our community  Johnnys Diner in Tracy on Wednesday and Mikes Coffee, Raw Juicing, Yogurt & Spirits in Manteca on Thursday  and this morning I visited Wardens in Modesto as they celebrated 50 years in business. Wardens has grown over the years to be Central Valleys largest independently owned office products dealership. Last night I joined Stanislaus County Supervisor Vito Chiesa, State Senator Tom Berryhill, State Assemblymember Kristin Olsen, and Turlock Mayor Gary Soiseth for Government Night at CSU Stanislaus. I love being able to have a discussion with attendees and legislators on the state and local levels in these kind of town hall formats. I appreciate all who came out and asked questions. On Wednesday morning I was in Hughson to attend the Stanislaus County Peace Officers Association memorial service for our fallen. [image = Our law enforcement officials put their lives on the line to serve and protect us, and Im constantly thankful for their hard work. I visited the Gallo Center in downtown Modesto on Wednesday evening for a reception recognizing the efforts of Work for Warriors and some of the employers at Thursdays fair who have demonstrated a great commitment to hiring vets.

[R-TN6]","Click here to open this e-mail in its own browser window  Click here to open a plain text version of this email    Contact Me  | Serving You  | Media Center  | Legislative Work  | Our District  | Resources  Does This Seem Fair to You? Dear Friends, As if we needed more proof that the IRS does not have its house in order, an Inspector General's report  released just last Wednesday found that nearly 1,600 IRS employees willfully evaded their own tax payments over a ten year window. Worse, of those employees who knowingly violated tax law, over 60 percent retained their employment with the IRS and roughly 30 percent received awards and promotions. To put it another way, the very agency tasked with making sure you comply with our tax laws is knowingly keeping tax-cheats on the payroll - and you're shelling out for their salaries. This is another example of the Washington political class saying ""do as I say, not as I do."" It is immoral, and we have a responsibility to stop it. Here's how: 1. Enact Legislation to Hold Federal Employees Accountable It seems like a simple concept: if taxpayer dollars fund your salary, you should be held to the highest standard of accountability for paying your tax bill. But some in Washington don't see it that way. Just last month, the House held a vote on the Federal Employee Tax Accountability Act - legislation I supported to terminate the employment of tax delinquent federal employees and prohibit the federal government from hiring individuals with major outstanding tax debts. Unfortunately, Democrats overwhelmingly voted against our efforts and prevented what should have been a simple, bipartisan effort from securing the two-thirds vote needed for passage. You can see the vote totals for yourself here  . The good news is, because of how this bill was first offered - as a ""suspension vote"" - the House can bring it back for consideration later this year. Now that we have concrete proof that IRS employees are gaming the system, the House should vote on this commonsense accountability legislation without delay. 2. Reform Our Broken Tax Code Our tax code is more than 74,000 pages long and has not been reformed since 1986. As a result, the average taxpayer spends 13 hours just preparing to file their annual taxes. A tax system this complex gives the IRS too many opportunities to reach into Americans' daily lives and lends itself to more bureaucracy and longer payrolls at the agency overseeing it. If we cut the size of the tax code, we can be better positioned to cut the size of the IRS along with it. Last year, my colleagues and I on the Ways and Means Committee unveiled a draft tax reform proposal that would shrink the tax code by 25 percent and let 95 percent of filers get the lowest possible rate by simply claiming the standard deduction. We will continue to build on these efforts this year so that we can deliver a tax code that works for you - not the IRS. As we move forward on these fronts, we also continue to bring IRS employees before our committees so that we can get to the bottom of the agency's political targeting of conservatives, the ""lost"" emails of Lois Lerner, and - most recently - the poor customer service delivered during the 2015 tax-filing season. You can watch a video of my recent questioning of IRS Commissioner John Koskinen on this topic HERE  . One thing is clear: There remains a deep-rooted mistrust in the IRS and, as these latest reports show, that mistrust is well-founded. It is incumbent on the IRS to take action to correct these failures and it is our responsibility in Congress to press for answers and hold this agency accountable. I am committed to doing exactly that.

Over the past week, I also had the opportunity to speak with students from Litchfield High School, Shickley Elementary School, and Heartland Lutheran High School. E-news: Supporting Small Businesses Inspired by the American Dream, entrepreneurship drives our countrys economic success. During National Small Business Week (May 4-8), we recognize the many contributions small businesses make to our communities and local economy. Their wide-reaching impacts include employing more than 75 million Americans and creating approximately two out of every three new jobs. In Nebraska, more than 167,000 small businesses employ nearly 400,000 people. On my recent travels throughout the Third District, I have had the opportunity to visit many small businesses and talk with owners about the issues they face. From McBattas Specialty Advertising in Fairbury to American Bullet in Kimball to Beatrice Bakery Company, I have seen firsthand how small business owners create jobs in their communities and get Nebraska products to people across the country and around the world. Unfortunately, many federal policies directly interfere with these entrepreneurs success rather than supporting their hard work. The red tape rolling out of Washington is choking small businesses. According to a World Bank report, the U.S. ranked third worldwide in ease of starting a business in 2007. Last year, the U.S. came in 46th. Since 2008, more small businesses have closed than have opened. This is the first time business failures have exceeded startups since this data has been recorded, and it reflects an alarming increase in government regulation. Last year I launched Regulation Rewind to stand against government overreach, and I am continuing it into 2015. Through this initiative, I have identified unnecessary and overly burdensome regulations which hurt economic growth, limit opportunities for rural Americans, are inconsistent with the law, or are unfair. Many of these regulations directly impact Nebraskas small businesses. I hope you will contact me at /RegulationRewind  with your examples of overreaching federal regulations which need to be addressed. The House Ways and Means Committee, on which I serve, also works to reduce regulation and support small business growth. For example, the Americas Small Business Tax Relief Act originated in the Ways and Means Committee and passed the House in February. This legislation makes long-standing tax provisions permanent to give certainty to small business owners and allow them to plan for the future. In particular, the provision setting higher expensing levels under Section 179 of the tax code provides small businesses the certainty they need to invest in equipment while knowing those expenses will not be taxed up front by the federal government. Currently the Committee is focused on expanding U.S. trade by passing Trade Promotion Authority, which empowers Congress to direct the administrations negotiation of trade agreements. In Nebraska, small- and medium-sized businesses constitute 82 percent of exporters. With 95 percent of customers living outside our borders, opening more markets to Nebraska exporters is essential to leveling the global playing field for our small businesses. Although National Small Business Week has come to a close for 2015, I encourage all Nebraskans to support Third District small businesses year-round. In Washington, I will work to reduce burdensome regulations and open more trade opportunities for local entrepreneurs. I look forward to partnering with you on Regulation Rewind and other efforts to ensure Nebraskas small businesses receive the support they deserve. Preparing for Severe Weather Following Wednesday evening's severe weather, I viewed the tornado damage in Roseland on Thursday with Adams County Emergency Management Director Chip Volcek.

senior,"114,115,116",Male,N00004981,300038,"Durbin, Richard (Sen.) [D-IL]","Fellow Illinoisans, Today, too many hardworking American families are barely making ends meet. And largely its because these workers and their families rely on the dismal pay of minimum wage jobs. In Illinois alone, 400,000 workers earn the minimum wage. Of those, 100,000 live below the poverty line. If you work full time in America, you should be able to provide for your family, but thats impossible with todays federal minimum wage set at $7.25 per hour. Working 40 hours per week at that rate translates to about $15,000 per year  $3,000 below the poverty level for a family of three. Roberts story Last year, I met Robert who worked six days a week at $8.25 per hour at a local car dealership doing a little bit of everything  basically your traditional handy man. But it was not enough to make ends meet. Robert  working full time  had to tell his family they had to leave their home and move into a shelter. During the recession, Robert participated in the Put Illinois to Work program that helped Robert earn $10.00 per hour. It seems like a modest bump in pay, but it made a difference. Robert was able to move his family out of the shelter. They once again had their own home. They were paying their bills and stopped receiving government support programs. Raise the Wage Act All across the country, we have seen overwhelming momentum to raise wages for our workers. A national poll released this year showed 75% of Americans supporting a minimum wage above $12 per hour. Twenty-nine states and the District of Columbia, as well as 21 cities and counties, have already increased their minimum wage above the federal rate, including Illinois and Chicago. Last week, I joined my colleagues  including Senator Patty Murray of Washington, the lead Democrat on the Senates Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee  in introducing the Raise the Wage Act which would increase the national minimum wage to $12 per hour over the next five years and then index the wage to inflation. The bill would also gradually phase out the $2.13 tipped minimum wage to match the regular minimum wage. Click Here To Read More This would mean that a full-time worker making minimum wage will earn almost $25,000 a year. In Illinois alone, 1.6 million workers  about 28% of the states workforce  would see an increase in wages by an average of $3,200 a year. We know that when low wage workers earn money, they spend it. They buy food, clothes for the kids, and pay utility bills. The Raise the Wage Act would lift millions out of poverty and give families more money to put back into our economy.

[R-NJ11]","Congressman Rodney Frelinghuysen, Representing the 11th District of New Jersey *e-News 5/8/15* - *Small Business Owners: Key to a Healthy and Growing Economy* - *ER Visits on the Rise under Obamacare* - *Holding the Obama Administration Accountable for Iran Nuclear Deal* - *OP ED: On Cuba, Obama again comes up short at negotiating table* - *Attention All VETERANS!* - *Military Academy Career Night Coming Soon!* - *Salute: The Men and Women of Picatinny Arsenal* - *Salute: Farewell to John Spinnenger* - *Ghostly Voices from Edison Dolls*  *Small Business Owners: Key to a Healthy and Growing Economy* This week is Small Business Week, and with good reason. Consider these facts: There are an estimated 28 million [link 1]small businesses in the United States and they employ half of Americas workforce! Generally a small business is defined as any enterprise with fewer than 500 workers. And there are many of these companies as nearly 98 percent of all U.S. employers fall into this category. Small business is absolutely critical to a growing and healthy economy as they create nearly seven out of ten new jobs. In this regard, its very important that we allow them to grow by reducing needless regulation and keeping their tax burden as low as possible. In this regard, the Administration does not appear to be doing too well. Last year, the U.S. ranked 46th in ease of starting a business according to a World Bank report. In 2007, it ranked 3rd. In fact, since 2008, more small businesses have closed than have opened. This is the first time business casualties have exceeded business births since data has been recorded on the issue. The last thing a small business needs is uncertainty from their government, changes in the tax code, or excessive regulation. In this new Congress, we have passed several key bills to boost small businesses in the first 100 days alone. - We passedthe Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act (H.R. 527) to scale back the regulatory red tape that burdens Main Street so that small businesses are free to grow. - We passedthe Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act (H.R. 37), which cuts excess regulation so thatsmall businesses have access to the capital they need to grow and create good-paying jobs. - We passedtheSmall Business Tax Relief Act (H.R. 636) that helps to reduce uncertainty from government so that small businesses can invest intheir futureand grow. - We passedthe Save the American Workers Act (H.R. 30), which restores the 40-hour work week that Obamacares employer mandate destroyed so that small businesses can hire more workers at the hours that work for them. - We passedthe Hire More Heroes Act (H.R. 22) to exempt veterans from Obamacares employer mandate threshold if they already have health care through TRICARE or the VA so that no employers are penalized for hiring a veteran and that no veteran is left jobless because of the mandate. - We repealed the unfair death tax(H.R. 1105) to reform our tax system so that small businesses can be kept in the family, even when a loved one dies. Now, if we can get the Senate to pass these bills and have the President sign them, well be boosting small businesses, a key to a growing and healthy economy. Find more information using SBAs State-By-State [link 2]statistics. *ER Visits on the Rise under Obamacare* Of course, one of the most significant recent drags on job creation among small and large businesses has been the complicated implementation of the Affordable Care Act, or Obamacare. The President says his law is working ""better than expected,"" even as premiums and deductibles rise, the website remains a mess, and workers across America have had their hours and wages slashed. This week, a new report indicates that patient visits to the emergency room have surged since Obamacare took effect  just the opposite of what many Americans had been told would happen. A poll released Monday by the American College of Emergency Physicians shows that 28% of 2,099 doctors surveyed nationally saw large increases in volume, while 47% saw slight increases. By contrast, fewer than half of doctors reported any increases last year in the early days of the Affordable Care Act.

The Senate approved the bipartisan bill yesterday by a vote of 98-1. The measure would require a competed deal with Iran to be submitted to Congress, which could then vote to approve or disapprove the nuclear deal within 30 days. Sanctions on Iran could not be lifted during this consideration. While I am pleased that the House will have the opportunity to hold the Obama Administration accountable for the contents of any Iran deal it negotiates, I regret that this bill is not stronger. After all, a Congressional vote to disapprove a nuclear deal with Iran would not kill it. President Obama could veto such a measure, and the House and Senate would then need two-thirds majorities to override his veto.

As a member of the Defense Appropriations Subcommittee I was briefed on the changing mission as our troops draw down in Afghanistan and heard directly from our military commanders. Every American serving in the region deserves our full support and the resources to ensure that they can be successful in their mission and return home safely. This mission is important, but it cannot be limitless. Securing Afghanistans future needs to be in the hands of the Afghan people. Afghanistan continues to be a dangerous place. Our servicemen and women continue to face real risks from the Taliban and other extremists. These women and men do their jobs on high alert and while facing very real threats  which makes their professionalism and skill all the more impressive. U.S. troops and our allies are transitioning their role to support Afghans as they provide their own security and govern their countrys future. Afghan women and girls have a critical role to play in the future of Afghanistans society. This is important to me and to the American women  both civilian and military  who work with Afghan women and girls to create more opportunities in education, jobs and security.  I was able to meet with the NATO forces who are working to help integrate women into the Afghan military and police forces. Our allies are doing fantastic work to ensure that the proper protocols, training and resources are in place to ensure that Afghan women are able to serve their country. As our American troops draw down and our footprint in the country diminishes in coming years, this partnership between our NATO allies and the Afghan military will be critical. One of the most significant changes in Afghanistan since 2001 has been the rise of women to power within the countrys parliament. Under Taliban rule women were denied basic rights and had no representation in parliament. Today, Afghanistans parliament is 28% women. We met with women parliamentarians and heard more about the progress that has been made since 2001 towards securing full rights within society for the women of Afghanistan. The support of U.S. military and diplomatic officials has been critical towards making advances, as has support from the U.S. government for programs that prioritize women in Afghan society. With our partnership, Afghan women have made tremendous strides in terms of reducing infant mortality rates, improving literacy rates, and protecting girls from being forced into marriage. My delegation included three other Members of Congress  Rep. Martha McSally (R-AZ), Rep. Susan Davis (D-CA), and Rep. Norma Torres (D-CA). We were fortunate enough to meet with Afghan women who are attending university and are experiencing firsthand the impacts of these changes in their lives. It was incredibly inspiring to meet with these university students who are participating more in their countrys social, economic and political systems. These young women are thrilled to take advantage of the new opportunities that are available to them and their generations success will be critical to the success of their country. I want to recognize the recent deployments of the 133rd Airlift Wing and the St. Paul based 34th Combat Aviation Brigade of the Minnesota National Guard. They provided humanitarian relief, transportation of service members and critical supplies, as well as essential aviation security operations in the region. I heard nothing but praise for the men and women of the Minnesota National Guard. All of them have my highest respect and appreciation.  In addition to our servicemen and women, embassy staff and others are critical to our mission in Afghanistan. I will always remember having breakfast with some of the mothers who are serving in our embassy in Afghanistan as well as lunch with military moms. These mothers are separated from their families for long periods of time as they serve our country. With Mothers Day approaching this weekend, we shared Mothers Day cards made by American school children with these women. They just loved the cards! The lasting impression I have of this trip is one of the U.S. military, U.S. embassies and our NATO partners working together to ensure Afghan women and girls have a better future. In very difficult and at times dangerous surroundings, it was inspiring to see firsthand the support that Afghan women are receiving as they work to build a country for this generation and the next. And this Mothers Day, for all those American and Afghan women who are working to build a better future for their children and their countries, I extend my sincerest gratitude and true admiration. Happy Mothers Day to mothers all around the world!

The TPA bill has passed committees in the House and Senate and could be voted on at any time in both chambers. The bill would let the president sign and enter into a trade deal before Congress approves its contents and then force Congress to vote within 90 days on a done deal with all amendments prohibited. **""Whenever the U.S. negotiates a new foreign trade agreement the American people are promised greater job creation and increased exports, but time after time the result has been fewer jobs, lower wages, and a bigger trade deficit, said Rep. Lipinski. ""Since NAFTA was signed, Illinois alone has lost close to 300,000 manufacturing jobs. These were quality jobs with high wages and good benefits that supported hard-working middle class families.** **""Unfortunately, history keeps repeating itself. The Administration promised that the Korea Free Trade Agreement would produce 70,000 new jobs and soaring exports, but since it was implemented in 2012 weve seen a loss of 60,000 American jobs and a 25% increase in the manufactured goods trade deficit,"" continued Lipinski. ""Despite the failure of the Korea agreement, the Administration is using it as a template for a much larger agreement that is currently being negotiated, the Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP). The TPP covers 11 U.S. trading partners that account for 40% of our trade. The TPP is the first trade deal that would get fast-tracked. We have to stop this endless cycle of failure.

Fighting Invasive Species  I toured the Hammond Bay Biological Lab on Tuesday and was very impressed with the work they are doing to fight invasive species in the Great Lakes. They had just captured 15 parasitic sea lampreys that they will be using for research purposes. As the founder and Chairman of the Congressional Invasive Species Caucus, I understand just how great a threat these species pose to the health of our Great Lakes. Labs like the one at Hammond Bay are leading the way in developing solutions to this challenge. Promoting Small Businesses  This week is Small Business Week across the nation. It's a time to recognize the many contributions that small businesses make to our economy. Not only do small businesses keep thousands of people employed in Northern Michigan, they also provide critical services and develop ingenious ways of serving the needs of consumers. I will always work to support small businesses in Congress. I was glad to meet with entrepreneurs like Tommy Dowd of Harborside Cycle in Alpena (pictured here) in order to learn more about some of the issues facing small businesses in our district.

,114,Female,N00007360,43364,"Pelosi, Nancy (Rep.) [D-CA12]","Celebrating Cinco de Mayo On Tuesday, we were reminded of the rich and diverse immigrant heritage that is the heart of our country. Immigration is the constant reinvigoration of America, and each generation of immigrants makes America more American. Every May 5th has served as an opportunity to honor the proud history of our Mexican neighbors, and to celebrate the generations of contributions that Mexican Americans and all Hispanic Americans have made to the United States and specifically to San Francisco. Democrats will continue to push for bold action to restore accountability, compassion and common sense to our broken immigration system. Let us draw fresh inspiration from the Battle of Puebla, and let us renew our determination to achieve comprehensive immigration reform that honors the heritage, the history, and the values of our nation. By raising the federal minimum wage to $12 an hour over the next five years, we can bring opportunity, prosperity, and dignity to hard-working American families. San Francisco continues to lead the way on fair wages, as today our citys minimum wage increases to $12.25 on its way to $15/hour by 2018. Congress should act now to increase the minimum wage and improve the lives of working families across the country. Lets give Americans a raise. My office was recently was recently contacted by a constituent who co-founded a startup company that employs more than 60 workers in San Francisco. He filed to become a permanent resident in October. At that time, the immigration service reported that it would take 5 months to process the application. However, after waiting for over 7 months, he had still not received a response on his application. Therefore, my staff contacted the immigration service to bring the matter to its attention. Shortly thereafter, my staff was informed that my constituents application to become a permanent resident had been approved. Nancy Pelosi @NancyPelosi Aprils jobs report represents another good step fwd but we must do more & raise the wages for hard-working families. goo.gl/LDVsbg 6:39 AM - 8 May 2015 To follow Congresswoman Pelosi on twitter, please click here.

,114,Male,N00028133,43443,"Lamborn, Doug (Rep.) [R-CO5]","U.S. Congressman Doug Lamborn, Colorado's 5th Congressional District *Dear Friend,* *After another busy week in Washington, the House Armed Services Committee completed its work on the 2016 National Defense Authorization Act and the full House voted on Appropriations bills for the VA and military construction, as well as for energy and water programs. The House also voted to pass the conservative budget put together by the House and the Senate.* *Important social issues were also part of the debate last week as I worked in the House to preserve religious freedom for the citizens of Washington DC and weighed in on the marriage debate that took place in the Supreme Court.* *Please let me know if you require any assistance with a federal government agency by contacting my local office at (719) 520-0055.* *I am honored to serve as your Representative in Washington.* *Sincerely,*  [image = [image = NDAA Work Pic.JPG] A point-of-view shot from the 18.5 hour NDAA markup session  *2016 NDAA* - On Wednesday, May 29th, I took part in an eighteen and a half hour mark-up amendment session for the FY2016 National Defense Authorization Act in the House Armed Services Committee. I had 14 amendments adopted into the final language of the bill, in addition to work on the underlying language in the bill and amendments in subcommittee. The bill now moves to the floor of the House for a final passage vote in the near future and the opportunity to add more amendments to the legislation. My proposed amendments and efforts on the language of the bill itself are vital to the security of our nation and build on and support our important alliances and partnerships in an increasingly dangerous world.   *Congressman Lamborn 2016 NDAA Amendments & Initiatives*  Worked in the House Armed Services Committee to add $6 million to the Army Reserve budget in the National Defense Authorization Act for the new cybersecurity partnership program. The University of Colorado Colorado Springs and five other nationally recognized universities have partnered with the U.S. Army Reserve to create the new Cybersecurity Public Private Partnership program (Cyber P3). The $6 million secured by Congressman Lamborn provides full funding for this program in its inaugural year of operation.It is fantastic news for an innovative and forward thinking local project to be recognized at the national level. I was at the kick-off for this program back in February and am extremely impressed with the Cyber P3 program. When we look over the horizon and see the upcoming projected shortfalls of experienced cyber security professionals, it is heartening to know that two top flight organizations will be partnering to help address this pressing problem facing our national security. Thank you to UCCS Senior Vice Chancellor Martin Wood and retired Army Lieutenant General Ed Anderson for their hard work and dedication to this vitally important effort.  Partnered with Congresswoman Gwen Graham (FL-02) on an amendment authorizing research and development of an anti-tunneling defense system with Israel to protect from terrorist attacks and border incursions. The amendment, which combines language from H.R. 1349 and H.R. 1649, is similar to the 2011 legislative authorization for the highly successful Iron Dome Anti-Missile Defense System, which has stopped more than 1,200 rockets from hitting Israel. The bipartisan legislation is endorsed by AIPAC, the American Israel Public Affairs Committee. In addition to helping Israel secure its borders, the anti-tunneling defense technology discovered in this joint project could also be used to protect American military bases and our nations borders with Mexico and Canada.   Added an amendment requiring the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to Congress on Turkeys fight against terrorism, including foreign fighter flow and their harboring of Hamas.  Added a provision in the Iran Military Power Report looking at the transfer of Russian military technology to Iran, including the S-300 anti-aircraft missile system.  Added an amendment requiring the Secretary of Defense to submit a report to Congress on the military posture required in the Middle East to deter Iran from developing a nuclear weapon.  Added amendments expressing the Sense of Congress regarding the American ability to assure the use of space and to ensure a strong missile defense system and space sensor network.  Added an amendment directing an assessment of the industrial base of the directed energy field.  Added an amendment directing the Department of Defense to review the small business implications of using the OASIS contract vehicle.  Added an amendment directing the GAO to review the prevalence of cancelled contract solicitations and the wasted investment resulting from cancelled solicitations.   *Please click HERE [link 1] to watch me add the anti-tunneling amendment to the NDAA* [image = NDAA Pic.jpg]  *HOLDING PRESIDENT OBAMA ACCOUNTABLE* - Last week, I had an op-ed published in the *Daily Signal, *a conservative publication of the Heritage Foundation*.* *Obamas Made Some Bad Deals. Why He Should Stop Sidelining Congress* I have some bad news for Americans and our allies around the world: President Obama is quite good at making bad deals, particularly with dangerous regimes and groups.  The nuclear negotiations with Iran are but the most recent example. A nuclear framework agreement has been reached, but the latest deal coming out of Switzerland is dangerous on two fronts. First, it doesnt protect Americas interests or protect Israel, our strongest strategic ally in the region. Second, the agreement doesnt meaningfully restrict the extremist Iranian regime from expanding its nuclear program.  An example also can be found in 2014, when President Obama traded five hardened terrorists imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay for the release of Sgt. Bowe Bergdahl, who had been held captive by the Taliban for five years. What makes this deal particularly disturbing, aside from the president even entertaining the idea of freeing dangerous enemies of America, is Bergdahl already was suspected of desertion. In essence, we swapped five terrorists for one suspected deserter. Thats not a good deal. To add insult to injury, at least one terrorist involved in the swap is believed to already have rejoined the Talibans fighting forces.  What do these two bad deals say about this administration? There are striking parallels that should be pointed out.  Both bad deals relegated Congress to the sidelines when it should have been instrumental in helping make decisions in these matters. In the case of Bergdahl, the president conducted the swap without seeking consultation from Congress, even though U.S. law explicitly requires the president and his administration to notify Congress 30 days before it transfers any prisoners from Guantanamo Bay. This failure to notify was no accident; it was the president deliberately flouting the law of the land.  In the case of the Iran nuclear talks, once again Congress was left in the dark and presented with a situation where the president was unilaterally making decisions. The president placed more faith in the despotic leaders of Iran than in the process established by our Constitution and the democratically elected members of Congress. This is a slap in the face of Congress and the people we represent.  In both situations, the president downplayed the questionable aspects of the deals but exaggerated facts to make the deals sound better than they were. He made grandiose claims about Irans good deeds in the nuclear talks but ignored the blatant threats the Iranian regime has made toward the United States and Israel. He argued the Taliban terrorists released in the Bergdahl deal werent a threat to American lives. This was, to say the least, extremely nave.  It seems clear the president acted as he did because he knew his actions in both situations would not be tolerated by Congress. As is customary with President Obama, when he knows he has a tough sell to the American people and Congress, he creates ways to maneuver around even the constitutional barriers to push forward his agenda.  It is clear President Obama doesnt want to work with Congress because we may thwart his plans. Instead of working within the reasonable limits established by the Constitution and trusting that good policy will win in the end, President Obama repeatedly has shown a willingness to play fast and loose with the truth to achieve his policy goals. This is wrong and dangerous.  Ultimately, we want to be able to trust our president, to trust he will make the right decisions for our country, our safety and our strategic allies. We dont want our country to be shortchanged. Poor decisions such as these place our country and our troops in danger. And the question must be asked: What would stop our enemies from capturing more soldiers (and potentially even civilians) to trade for other terrorists in Guantanamo Bay?  The president is willing to trade known terrorists for a suspected deserter. This leads to a crisis of trust. If we cant trust President Obama to make the right decision regarding the Bergdahl situation, can we trust him to make the right decision on Iran? Sadly, the answer appears to be a resounding no.  *VOTING FOR OUR VETERANS* - I supportedH.R. 2029, the Military Construction and Veterans Affairs and Related Agencies Appropriations Act. This legislation increases funding for our veterans by 5.6%, in addition to the $15 billion appropriated last summer to fund legislation designed to decrease veteran wait times. This legislation is a win for our veterans. It boosts funding by over five percent, mandates accelerations to VA claims processing, requires a VA-DOD electronic health record, and keeps Congressional attention focused on the VA Department.   [image = VA Approps A.jpg]    *SUPPORTING ENERGY AND NATIONAL SECURITY GOALS* - Isupported H.R. 2028, the FY 2016 Energy and Water Appropriations Bill. This legislation ensures the safety of our nuclear stockpile, provides adequate funding to the Army Corps of Engineers for critical infrastructure projects, cuts bureaucratic red tape, moves us further toward the goal of energy independence, and prohibits the implementation of the EPA's ""Waters of the U.S."" rule. I was also able to insert an amendment strengthening the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation Program. This critical program allows companies across the U.S. to develop cutting-edge technologies with new partners in Israel in order to advance Americas energy goals. Furthermore, the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperative Agreement facilitates greater cooperation and sharing of knowledge between American and Israeli universities on traditional and alternative energy.  - H.R. 2028 is a comprehensive piece of legislation that accomplishes many critical national security and energy goals, all while cutting over 600 million dollars from the President's budget request. Two features of this bill are extremely important to me. First, the efforts made to increase the safety and reliability of our nuclear weapons security programs are absolutely essential to our national defense. Second, prohibiting the out-of-control regulatory mindset at the EPA by stopping ""Waters of the U.S."" sends a message to the American people that we are not going to let belligerent bureaucrats ruin their ability to run their businesses and live their lives without micromanagement from Washington DC.   *Please click HERE [link 2] to watch my Floor Speech on the U.S.-Israel Energy Cooperation Program* [image =     *FIGHTING FOR RELGIOUS FREEDOM AND TRADITIONAL MARRIAGE* - Ijoined a bipartisan vote in support of House Joint Resolution 43, a resolution disapproving of the District of Columbias so-called *Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Act (RHNDA).*This discriminatory act violates the basic freedom of religious and secular organizations to operate according to their sincerely held beliefs. H.J. Res. 43 recognizes these serious problems and outlines Congress disapproval of such intrusions on the ability of entities to operate in accordance with their moral or religious beliefs. Congress has constitutional authority over all D.C. laws and is acting to stop the D.C. Councils blatant disregard of basic constitutional rights. *Please click HERE [link 3]**to see me support Religious Freedom on the House Floor* * [image = *Background information from the Republican Study Committee*  H.J. Res. 43 is a response to the Districts Reproductive Health Non-Discrimination Amendment Act (RHNDA), which requires employers to provide health insurance covering the termination of unborn children and to hire individuals who may advocate for those practices, even if that goes against the employers religious beliefs.   *Text of Congressman Lamborn's Floor Speech*  Mr. Speaker, I rise today in support of House Joint Resolution 43, which will stop the implementation of the Reproductive Health and Nondiscrimination Act within the District of Colombia. All Americans should have the freedom to live and work according to their religious and moral convictions without fear of the government punishing them for doing so. This bill, passed by the D.C. City Council, discriminates against religious and pro-life advocacy groups in the District of Colombia and is a clear violation of their First Amendment freedoms. Under this discriminatory act, these organizations would be forced to make employment decisions contrary to their deeply held beliefs about the sanctity of human life, and would further require them to provide abortion coverage for their employees. This law represents a flagrant disregard for the conscience rights of all D.C. employers and must be stopped. Mr. Speaker, I urge my fellow Members of the House to vote Yes on this important resolution of disapproval.   - Last week, the Supreme Court heard oral arguments in*Obergefell v. Hodges*, the case determining whether the Constitution requires the states to redefine marriage to include same-sex couples.There is nothing in our Constitution that prohibits a state from retaining the time-honored definition of marriage as a union between one man and one woman, and the debate about the importance and public purpose of marriage should be left to the states. The Supreme Court does not have the authority to redefine marriage for the states, and I am hopeful the Supreme Court will respect the democratic process.   *STANDING WITH ISRAEL* - Recently, I served asthe first guest on former Knesset Member Dov Lipman's inaugural broadcast of the Voice of Israel radio program. Congressman Lamborn stressed the importance of maintaining a strong and enduring relationship between the United States and Israel. *Please click HERE [link 4]**to listen to the interview* [image =    SCENES FROM WASHINGTON DC* [image = I appreciated meeting with BLM Colorado State Director Ruth Welch and Associate Director Greg Shoop.

The Central American Minors Refugee/Parole Program began in December 2014 and sends empty airplanes to Central America to bring illegal immigrants into the United States. *The full text of our letter calling on President Obama to end this amnesty program can be found HERE [link 1]* *Background information from Congressman Paul Gosar's (AZ-04) office* The Obama Administration has been taking applications for an amnesty program [link 2] since December 1, 2014 that will fly illegal immigrants [link 3] from Central American Countries to the U.S. for the purposes of providing an orderly alternative to the dangerous journey that some... are currently taking to the United States.  The Central American Minors (CAM) Refugee/Parole Program requires parolees to pay for their flights and medical care but will provide cash, loans, as well as help with travel and medical assistance [link 4] to refugees participating in the program at taxpayer expense.Media reports further indicate [link 5] that parolees participating in the program could include felons and immigrants that were previously deported.  Shockingly, DHS website states, ""There is no fee to participate in this refugee/parole program and it is prohibited for anyone to charge a fee for completion of the form."" Worse yet, an agency official indicated in a hearing last week that some CAM program participants are eligible because they have a family member living in the U.S. who was one of the beneficiaries of President Obamas previous deferred action amnesty executive orders.  The 37 members of the House who joined Rep. Gosar in this effort include Representatives Brian Babin, Lou Barletta, Diane Black, Marsha Blackburn, Rod Blum, Charles Boustany, Jim Bridenstine, Mo Brooks, Doug Collins, Mike Conaway, Scott DesJarlais, Jeff Duncan, John Duncan, Bill Flores, Trent Franks, Louie Gohmert, Paul Gosar, Tim Huelskamp, Lynn Jenkins, Sam Johnson, Walter Jones, Steve King, Doug LaMalfa, Doug Lamborn, Cynthia Lummis, Kenny Marchant, John Mica, Pete Olson, Steve Palazzo, Scott Perry, Mike Rogers, Matt Salmon, David Schweikert, Pete Sessions, Lamar Smith, Randy Weber and Ted Yoho.

We apologize for any inconvenience this may cause. Addressing Concerns and Rumors About Jade Helm 15 Recently, I have heard from many of you concerned about the U.S. military's Jade Helm 15 training exercise and what it means for Texas. Jade Helm 15 is a training exercise that will be led by the U.S. Army Special Operations Command (USASOC) with Special Operation Forces from all four services. Around 1,200 U.S. service members are expected to participate in the exercise in Texas from July 15, 2015 to September 15, 2015. For over 40 years, the U.S. military has conducted similar training exercises. In fact, Jade Helm 15 is modeled after Robin Sage-a training exercise that began in 1974 and spanned 15 counties in North Carolina. Texas has a long history of supporting our military and their families. This exercise will enable our military to receive the best possible training so they can continue to carry out the mission and keep America safe. Training exercises are expected to take place on military installations and private land (with the permission of the landowner), and local law enforcement is working with the military to make sure our local communities are notified of upcoming exercises ahead of time. To be clear, this training exercise is NOT implementing martial law or a military takeover of the state of Texas by the federal government. The exercise will not infringe upon our civil liberties. As you know, the U.S. military is sworn to uphold and defend the U.S. Constitution and I have the utmost trust and confidence in our nation's military to continue doing so. Please join me in continuing to support our brave men and women in uniform, their families, and all who keep America safe and sacrifice so much for our freedom. Teacher Appreciation Week May 4th to May 8th is Teacher Appreciation Week. Please join me in thanking all of our hardworking teachers in the 19th District of Texas who do so much for our students and our communities. Earlier today, I had the pleasure of visiting Lubbock-Cooper High School and a class participating in the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association's Capitol Hill Challenge-a financial education program for students to enhance their financial literacy. I spoke about the importance of financial skills and economics. The young men and women in the class were very impressive. You can learn more about the Capitol Hill Challenge here: National Day of Prayer On Thursday, our nation honors the 64th annual National Day of Prayer. As a proud co-founder of the Congressional Prayer Caucus, I recently joined several of my colleagues in signing a letter supporting the role that prayer has played in the history of America and in the legislature. On this National Day of Prayer we must re-commit to continuing to fight for our freedom to believe and America's founding ideals. The Arsenal of Democracy: World War II Victory Capitol Flyover This Friday marks the 70th anniversary of Victory in Europe (VE Day)-the end of World War II (WWII) in Europe. To celebrate and recognize the sacrifice of our nation's veterans, there will be a flyover in our nation's capital. This flyover will mirror the aircraft parades following the victory in WWII. Over 50 historic WWII era aircraft will flyover the WWII Memorial, the National Mall, and the U.S. Capitol. A ceremony will take place from 9:30 a.m. CT to 10:45 a.m. CT and the flyover will take place from 11:10 a.m. CT to 11:50 a.m. CT. To watch a live webcast of this historic event click here  .

View online version A Big Week Tuesday, May 5, 2015 Dear Lindsey, We recently had a very big week in Congress in our efforts to protect the environment. On April 22, we celebrated Earth Day, a day established largely in response to the devastating 1969 oil spill off the Central Coast of California. That day I introduced a bill in Congress that would place a moratorium on offshore fracking in federal waters off the West Coast until a full environmental review of the controversial practice is completed. While we still know very little about the impacts of onshore fracking, we know even less about impacts of offshore fracking. Until we can gain a better understanding of the scope and impacts of these activities, offshore fracking should be halted. We should not be putting the environment at risk because of inadequate oversight. I held a press conference to talk about the bill. You can watch KEYT's coverage here [We also commemorated the fifth anniversary of the Deepwater Horizon disaster in the Gulf of Mexico. Our economy and environment are both still paying the price for this disaster, which is why I spoke at a hearing on Capitol Hill about the need for strengthening safety standards in offshore oil drilling. You can watch video of my testimony here [Finally, as we all know, climate change is one of the most urgent and serious problems we face, which is why I spoke during an Energy and Commerce Committee hearing against deeply flawed legislation that would derail the EPA's efforts to regulate carbon emissions for the first time from power planets.

I've listened to many local farmers, families, and small businesses who are being impacted by this crisis, and I know many people are worried. We need to focus on bringing emergency help to the people who are being harmed now. Thats why I fought for an amendment to a water funding bill to bring more emergency drought relief to our state and help families, farmers, and small businesses during this tough time >> Please click here to see me fight for emergency relief on the House floor: This issue is too serious to play games that pit Republicans against Democrats or place southern delta interests ahead of Northern California. We need immediate relief now. We also need long-term, comprehensive solutions to secure water access and storage in our state. Thats why my amendment also sought to help communities modernize their water infrastructure. That would help us use water more wisely and prepare for future droughts. I've also voted to upgrade the Folsom Dam, upgrades that are now underway. This project is creating local jobs and when complete will help our local reservoir hold more water. And Im supporting other bills to implement water recycling and boost water storage at other regional reservoirs. But the most immediate concern has to be helping people who need it now.

[D-NJ8]","Dear Friend, It was a busy week in New Jersey and in Washington with events in the 8th District, meetings with groups from New Jersey, and committee hearings. Before traveling to Washington last week, I participated in a press conference with the West New York Housing Authority. The Housing Authority was recently selected by the U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development to participate in the Rental Assistance Demonstration Program (RAD). This program represents the future of housing rehabilitation; West New York is one of the first New Jersey towns to take advantage of this opportunity. This is an exciting initiative: it will ensure access to safe and affordable housing for many New Jersey families. I also was honored to receive the 21st Annual Newark Councilman at Large Louis Quintana's Man of the Year award. I will continue to fight for the priorities that are important to Newark, including paving the way toward immigration reform along with making improvements to local police departments and health care facilities. After arriving in Washington on Tuesday, I met with members of the Humane Society to receive the Humane Advocate award. This award is given to Members of Congress who demonstrate leadership on animal protection legislation. I will continue to stand up for animal rights and welfare as new legislation is introduced during the 114th Congress. It was great meeting with the New Jersey AARP in Washington last week. Members from New Jersey visited to discuss the issues that are affecting retirees across the country. I continue to be a steadfast advocate for America's retirees and the issues they care about; including retirement security, the health of Medicare, Social Security, and the high cost of prescription drugs. Additionally, I met with Colonel Michael Underkofler from Joint Base McGuire-Dix-Lakehurst last week. Colonel Underkofler came to give a briefing on the 514th Mobility Wing stationed at the Joint Base. The 514th Air Mobility Wing is an associate reserve wing comprised of 24 subordinate units that support airlift, air refueling, and aeromedical evacuation missions using KC-10 Extender and C-17 Globemaster III aircrafts. It is always great to meet with our men and women in uniform who are stationed in the Garden State. Later in the week, the House of Representatives held a joint session of Congress for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. I appreciated the Prime Minister's condolences for the American lives lost during World War II. I look forward to working with Japan to foster cooperation between our two countries through my capacity as a member of the Foreign Affairs Committee. I also attended several Foreign Affairs Committee hearings last week. Earlier in the week, the Europe and Eurasia Subcommittee held a hearing on the status of the Balkans. Later in the week I participated in the Western Hemisphere Subcommittee's hearing to examine the Administration's Fiscal Year 2016 foreign aid budget request for Central America. Conditions in Central America and the effectiveness of the U.S. response to the migration crisis were among the topics discussed during this important hearing. During the past few weeks in Washington, transportation has been a recurring, yet important topic; last week was no exception. First, I took part in a Transportation and Infrastructure Committee hearing on the Coast Guard Authorization Act of 2015. During this markup, I voted on key amendments that are critical to the funding of the Coast Guard. This bill will provide an effective level of funding for the Coast Guard to protect our waters for the next two fiscal years. Later, New Jersey Department of Transportation Commissioner Jamie Fox visited to give a briefing on the state of New Jersey's transportation infrastructure. Every day, New Jerseyans drive on roads in need of repair, pass over bridges that are structurally deficient, and travel through tunnels that are over a century old. I agree with Commissioner Fox that New Jersey, and the rest of the country, are in desperate need of a robust, long-term transportation funding solution. I will continue to work with my colleagues in Washington and in New Jersey to ensure that our federal and state governments are making infrastructure investments that are long overdue.

,114,Male,N00026148,43427,"Gohmert, Louie (Rep.) [R-TX1]","Gohmert Statement on Jade Helm Exercises WASHINGTON, D.C. Rep. Louie Gohmert (TX-01) released the following statement on the Jade Helm 15 exercises scheduled to take place in Texas and various other states: Over the past few weeks, my office has been inundated with calls referring to the Jade Helm 15 military exercise scheduled to take place between July 15 and September 15, 2015. This military practice has some concerned that the U.S. Army is preparing for modern-day martial law. Certainly, I can understand these concerns. When leaders within the current administration believe that major threats to the country include those who support the Constitution, are military veterans, or even cling to guns or religion, patriotic Americans have reason to be concerned. We have seen people working in this administration use their government positions to persecute people with conservative beliefs in God, country, and notions such as honor and self-reliance. Because of the contempt and antipathy for the true patriots or even Christian saints persecuted for their Christian beliefs, it is no surprise that those who have experienced or noticed such persecution are legitimately suspicious. Having served in the U.S. Army, I can understand why military officials have a goal to see if groups of Special Forces can move around a civilian population without being noticed and can handle various threat scenarios. In military science classes or in my years on active duty, I have participated in or observed military exercises; however, we never named an existing city or state as a hostile. We would use fictitious names before we would do such a thing. Once I observed the map depicting hostile, permissive, and uncertain states and locations, I was rather appalled that the hostile areas amazingly have a Republican majority, cling to their guns and religion, and believe in the sanctity of the United States Constitution. When the federal government begins, even in practice, games or exercises, to consider any U.S. city or state in 'hostile' control and trying to retake it, the message becomes extremely calloused and suspicious. Such labeling tends to make people who have grown leery of federal government overreach become suspicious of whether their big brother government anticipates certain states may start another civil war or be overtaken by foreign radical Islamist elements which have been reported to be just across our border. Such labeling by a government that is normally not allowed to use military force against its own citizens is an affront to the residents of that particular state considered as 'hostile,' as if the government is trying to provoke a fight with them. The map of the exercise needs to change, the names on the map need to change, and the tone of the exercise needs to be completely revamped so the federal government is not intentionally practicing war against its own states. Congressman Gohmert is the Vice Chair of the Judiciary Subcommittee on Crime, Terrorism and Homeland Security and the Chairman of the Natural Resources Subcommittee on Oversight and Investigations. Prior to being elected to serve in Congress, Louie was elected to three terms as District Judge in Smith County, Texas.

,114,Male,N00030744,43544,"Pompeo, Mike (Rep.) [R-KS4]","Greetings, Among the privileges of serving as your representative in Congress is the opportunity to meet and work with young people all across South Central Kansas. Last week I hosted a reception for high school artists from across the district who competed in the 2015 Congressional Art Competition. It was a remarkable day and the talent demonstrated by all who participated was truly top-notch. Each piece highlighted the unique artistic ability of Fourth District Kansas students. You can see all of the art here: The Congressional Institute permits members of Congress to voluntarily host a competition to honor the artistic talents of high school students in their district. The winner of the competition and a guest are treated to a trip to Washington, D.C. for an awards ceremony. There they will join the other competition winners who will all have their artwork hung in the U.S. Capitol for an entire year. I recognized the 68 students from 15 high schools around the Fourth District who submitted a record number of 126 pieces of art. Susan and I, along with members from our Advisory Board, celebrated the talents of the students who submitted artwork, gave honorable mention awards to nine students, and named the top three winners: The competition was tough with very high-quality works submitted. I want to thank each of the members of our community that gave freely of their time to provide an impartial, juried experience to these talented young people. - Charles Baughman, Monart",2015-01-06,4,Rep.,Representative,true,KS,pompeo.newsletter@mail.house.gov,05/05/2015,Republican,125023,,http://pompeo.house.gov,Representative for Kansas's 4th congressional district,Mike,RepMikePompeo,,Pompeo,P000602,202-225-6216,1963-12-30,https://www.govtrack.us/congress/members/mike_pompeo/412431,congressmanpompeo,,representative,623387,Representative,2017-01-03,Rep.

,114,Male,N00028133,43443,"Lamborn, Doug (Rep.) [R-CO5]","U.S. Congressman Doug Lamborn, Colorado's 5th Congressional District *Congressman Lamborn Supports Small Businesses* To honor Small Business Week, make sure you shop local. Doing so will support an industry segment that creates two out of every three new jobs in America. Congressman Lamborn has voted for multiple bills that have passed the House and are designed to assist our small businesses: The Small Business Regulatory Flexibility Improvements Act (H.R. 527) scales back the regulatory red tape that burdens Main Street so that small businesses are free to grow. The Promoting Job Creation and Reducing Small Business Burdens Act (H.R. 37) cuts excess regulation so that small businesses have access to the capital they need to grow and create good-paying jobs. The Small Business Tax Relief Act (H.R. 636) helps to reduce uncertainty from government so that small businesses can invest in their future and grow. The Save the American Workers Act (H.R. 30) restores the 40-hour work week that Obamacares employer mandate destroyed so that small businesses can hire more workers at the hours that work for them. The Hire More Heroes Act (H.R. 22) exempts veterans from Obamacares employer mandate threshold if they already have health care through TRICARE or the VA so that no employers are penalized for hiring a veteran and that no veteran is left jobless because of the mandate.  H.R. 1105 repealed the death tax, an important reform to our tax system that ensures small businesses can be kept in the family, even when a loved one dies.
